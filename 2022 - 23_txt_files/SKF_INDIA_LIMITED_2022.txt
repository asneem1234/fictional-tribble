10. 	 Health and safety management system:
	
a.	
Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Yes/ 
No).	
	
	
If yes, the coverage such system?
	
	
The overall health and safety ambition for SKF is to reach zero accidents. Safety comes ﬁrst and we believe that 
all work-related accidents can be prevented. Our primary goals include preventing injuries as well as safeguarding 
the health of all employees at the workplace. Our internal systems and controls are very well aligned with strategic 
goals aiming to reduce waste, safety risks, environmental impacts and operational costs.
	
	
SKF India Limited is an ISO 14001:2015/ ISO 45001:2018 certified company and we strictly follow EnMS & EHS 
system for management of occupational health hazards. We conduct Management Review meetings once in a 
year where Safety & Environment Management related issues like Legal compliance, Internal & External audits, 
and observations including safety are discussed. For identification of hazards, we conduct Internal and external 
audits i.e., Group EHS audit and observations are used for improving the effectiveness of existing controls.
	
	
All occupants of the premises are given adequate training through third-party seminars, training programmes, 
and workshops in addition to in-house sensitisation programmes. We also circulate various learning modules, 
publications, and newsletters for regular appraisal of safety-related news. We celebrate National Safety Month and 
World Environment Day to increase awareness on safety and environment. During the year, we had ﬁve recordable 
accidents and actions were taken to prevent such incidents in future. We have intensiﬁed our focus to reach our 
zero accident vision by conducting various engagement and awareness programmes.
	
b. 	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis 
by the entity?
	
	
As per the EMS, SKF India uses HIRA (Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment), a qualitative risk assessment 
to understand and identify the potential safety related risks and strategize mitigation plans for the management 
of risks. We have identified Emergencies like Fire, Spills / leakages, Accident, Food Poisoning, Vehicular Accidents, 
Electric Shock, Natural Disaster etc. ERP is available for management of precautionary controls of the above 
risks. Mock drills are conducted regularly. Details plan of ERP (Emergency Response Plan) & Mock drill reports 
are available at plant facilities. In addition, various third-part audits and compliance audits are taken up for 
management of potential health and safety risks.
	
c. 	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such 
risks? 	
	
	
We have a clearly defined, communicated, well-known, established and maintained procedure for managing unsafe 
conditions throughout the operational boundary. Employee participation is our culture for identification of work-
related unsafe conditions. We encourage the involvement of employees / supervisors / managers in structured 
HIRA (Hazard identification and risk assessment) preparation / Safety walk / and sharing valuable feedback. SKF 
health and safety committees operate at factory or unit management level with the objective of bringing together 
worker and management representatives to discuss and agree on essential measures to improve the health and 
safety performance of SKF India. Employees and workers are trained to take up precautionary measures and 
remove themselves in event of any hazard.
	
d. 	
Do the employees/ worker of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services?
	
	
SKF India has established dispensary support at all locations with tie-ups with doctors for  employee health 
consultations. We have 24 hours ambulance service for emergency medical requirements. We have also tied up 
with hospitals to provide emergency services including healthcare services and treatment of workplace-related 
injuries. 
	
	
Periodic health check-ups of employees and their families are done at renowned hospitals to ensure health and 
well-being of our workforce. We have an internal medical scheme for workers and an external scheme for staff 
employees, providing non-occupational health services to cater to their needs. Additionally, we organise need-

Does the entity have a framework/ policy on cyber security and risks related to data privacy? If available, provide

Increasing information security threats, increasing customer scrutiny and regulatory requirements to adhere to 
information security standards have placed responsibility on the Company to establish suitable due diligence for 
preventing the loss of customer data.
	
We have Risk management policy to assess and identify risks arising out of internal and external operating environments 
including financial, operational, sectoral, sustainability, information, cyber security risk or other risks. In addition, Risk 
management Committee also identifies other probable risks from time to time. To mitigate information security risk, 
cyber security risk and data privacy risks, we will continue the implementation of the information security program, 
including the controls in SKF’s Information Security Management System (ISMS).
