1
Energy Management, 
Carbon Emissions and 
Climate Change
Risk
Ductile Iron pipe & Fittings 
production process is a 
signiﬁcant contributor to 
greenhouse 
gases 
with 
emissions arising primarily 
during the conversion of iron 
ore to iron or subsequent 
reﬁning the iron to ﬁnished 
Ductile Iron products.
The 
sector 
is 
currently 
responsible for about 8% of 
global ﬁnal energy demand 
and 7% of energy sector CO2 
emissions.
The Company has been focusing 
on lowering fuel & electricity 
consumption, 
investing 
in 
utilization of waste gases, and 
expanding renewable (solar) 
energy capacities.
With the objective to reduce 
consumption of fossil fuel 
& resulting greenhouse gas 
emission, the organisation has 
adopted a strong & eﬀective 
Energy Management System 
as per ISO 50001 standard. The 
Green House Gas emission is 
closely monitored & controlled 
considering 
its 
importance 
to the global climate change 
in context with the UN SDG 
2030 commitments and India’s 
national commitment.

Water Management
Risk
Steel manufacturing is a 
water-intensive process, and 
improper water manage-
ment can impact operations 
and create reputational risks.
The Company has set up a state-
of-the-art eﬄuent treatment 
plant (ETP). 
The Company has built three 
big ponds where rainwater and 
all process blow-down water are 
collected and reused back in the 
process, for dust suppression 
and gardening purposes.
The Company has implemented 
various improvement actions 
in line with the Environmental 
Policy to continually increase 
treatment 
& 
recycling 
of 
waste 
water. 
Environment 
Management 
Cell 
takes 
suitable action to minimise 
the water consumption to the 
extent possible and to reduce 
the wastage of water via 
engineering control and / or 
administrative control. 
Additionally, at Srikalahasthi 
Works 
(SW), 
one 
of 
the 
facilities, the Company collects 
sewage water from Tirupati 
municipality. This wastewater 
undergoes treatment through 
a Sewage Treatment Plant 
(STP) before being recycled 
and utilized in the production 
process. This resulted in saving 
of approximately 3 lakh litres of 
water per day.

Health & Safety
Risk
The 
production 
activity 
involves various hazards, 
including 
occupational 
health risks for workers, 
such as exposure to high 
temperatures and machinery 
accidents. Failure to address 
these risks can lead to 
injuries, degrades reputation 
and increased operational 
costs.
The Company is committed 
to creating and maintaining 
a 
high-safety 
culture. 
It 
has 
implemented 
HIRA 
(Hazard Identiﬁcation & Risk 
Assessment) 
and 
conducts 
awareness 
programs 
and 
training for its employees and 
workers, regularly. The entire 
safety 
system 
undergoes 
periodic audits for continuous 
improvement. Pre-employment 
and Periodical Health check-ups 
are conducted for employees. 
Safety kaizen on operations is 
also in place to minimize safety 
and health risks.

Waste Management
Risk
The 
production 
activity 
generates 
both 
non-
hazardous and hazardous 
waste, which can adversely 
aﬀect 
the 
environment. 
To mitigate the impact on 
the workforce and nearby 
communities, the Company 
safely manages and disposes 
of waste in accordance with 
legal requirements.
As 
an 
ISO 
14001-certiﬁed 
organization, the Company has 
adopted a systematic approach 
and established a well-deﬁned 
waste 
management 
cell 
responsible for the safe storage, 
handling and disposal of waste 
in compliance with statutory 
requirements.
The Company follows the 4R 
approach, 
which 
includes 
recycling, reusing, reprocessing, 
and reducing waste, leading to 
a signiﬁcant waste reduction. 
With 
this 
approach, 
the 
Company focuses on recycling 
and reusing iron ore ﬁnes and 
Coke ﬁnes and non-hazard 
waste repurposed as a raw 
material for a sub-process.
