Note:  Wonderla has devised a Board Diversity Policy. Consideration and selection of candidates for appointment to the 
Board are based on merit and includes a review of any candidate's integrity, experience, educational background, industry or 
related experience and more general experience. Within that overriding emphasis on merit, the Nomination and Remuneration 
Committee of the Board (the "Committee") seeks to address Board vacancies by actively considering candidates that bring 
a diversity of background and opinion from amongst those candidates with the appropriate background and industry or 
related expertise and experience. The Committee's considerations include achieving an appropriate level of diversity having 
regard to factors such as race, gender, age, nationality, cultural and educational background. The policy may be accessed

operates 3 largest 
amusement parks in 
Kochi, Bengaluru and

Loss of reputation can 
result in the loss of 
customer thereby adversely 
impacting business of the 
Company.
Energy Efficiency 
and Energy 
Management
Risk/ Opportunity
Amusement Park 
Industry is an energy 
intensive industry. 
Initiatives for energy 
management and 
efficiency help Wonderla 
better control and 
optimize its use of 
energy throughout 
its operations, which 
lowers operational costs 
(through less energy 
consumption), increases 
resilience in the event of 
energy disruptions, and 
improves the company’s 
capacity to meet 
regulatory requirements.
Actions are being undertaken to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
by investing in reducing carbon 
footprints and increasing the 
share of renewable energy. At 
present, approximately 40% of a 
company’s power requirements 
are met by company owned and 
operated i.e. captive solar power 
plants with excess connected 
to grid. The Company has also 
developed an Environment, Social 
and Governance (ESG) Roadmap 
and has identified potentials 
projects for reducing carbon 
footprints in electricity. Wonderla 
has undertaken various projects on 
environmental sustainability such 
as: 
(a)	At Kochi, Wonderla has installed 
684 KW Solar Power Plant and 
Solar Water Heater System for 
utilities.
(b)	At Bangalore, Wonderla has 
installed 50 KW Solar Power 
Plant Solar Water Heater 
System for utilities and Solar 
Water Heater System for Pools.
(c)	At Hyderabad, Wonderla has 
installed 800 KW Solar Power

Water and

Management
Risk
Growing populations 
and erratic monsoons 
have resulted in 
water scarcity. 
National groundwater 
assessments have 
classified numerous 
Indian cities as “critical” 
or “over-exploited.”
Wonderla is a water 
intensive company, the 
same being used for 
water rides.
The 4R (Reduce, Recycle, Reuse 
& Replenish) method is used by 
Wonderla to ensure efficient water 
use and water conservation. Water 
recycling systems have been put in 
place at all of the company’s sites 
to lower freshwater drawdown. All 
properties under management use 
rainwater harvesting to replenish 
groundwater. Additionally, as 
part of our sustainable water 
management practices, Wonderla 
has Rainwater harvesting ponds 
with a capacity of 100MT/Day and 
the same are being utilized for our 
daily consumption needs.
Negative
Procurement
and Supply
Chain
sustainability
Risk
Supply chain disruptions 
may result from 
inefficiencies in the 
system and a significant 
dependence on a small 
number of suppliers or 
vendors in the event 
of external shocks. By 
using good relationship 
management and 
encouraging ethical 
procurement/ sourcing 
techniques, it is possible 
to maintain strong, long-
lasting relationships with 
suppliers and vendors.
Wonderla procures the products 
and supplies from reputed 
manufacturers and suppliers to 
maintain quality and consistency. 
The company undertakes adequate 
steps to ensure safety during 
transportation and optimizing the 
logistics to minimize environmental 
impact. We maintain a long-term 
relationship with suppliers and 
robust inventory management 
practices ensure a steady supply of 
raw materials at a competitive cost.
Negative
Occupational
Health and
Safety
Risk
Wonderla is primarily 
engaged in the business 
of amusement parks. 
The business’s nature 
considers health and 
safety a potential 
risk to the company’s 
bottom line. The health 
and safety of its 
employees, contractors, 
and customers is its 
top priority because 
Occupational Health 
and Safety (OHS) 
performance can have 
a negative impact 
on productivity or 
dramatically boost 
it. Additionally, all 
consumers are given 
access to secure and 
safe facilities as part of 
a continuous effort.
Wonderla is committed to 
safeguard the health and safety 
of all of its employees, visitors 
and contractors. In order to meet 
this commitment and comply with 
relevant OHS legislation, a Safety 
and Hygiene Plan (SHP) has been 
developed to manage the actual 
and potential hazards associated 
with normal park operations and 
any other activities relating to the 
operations of the functions and 
entertainment venues within the 
park precinct. The SHP is the heart 
of the Risk Management Policy of 
Wonderla. The Risk Management 
Policy can be accessed at: https://

Note - The Company has constituted a Risk Management and ESG Committee (“RMEC”) to assist the Board of Directors in 
the effective discharge of its primary responsibilities of identifying principal risks and implementing appropriate systems and 
risk assessment processes to manage such risks for the Company and to support the Company's ongoing commitment to 
environmental stewardship, health and safety, corporate social responsibility, corporate governance and sustainability as 
relevant to the Company.
