Statement by Director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets 
and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
	
Ganesh Benzoplast Limited offers extensive capacities for the storage of imported and exported liquid commodities, 
including petroleum and petrochemicals. The company also supplies chemicals such as Sodium Benzoate, Benzoic 
Acid, and Benzoic Acid. Additionally, it provides rail logistics services that entice and motivate its dedicated clientele 
to shift from road transport to rail. This is achieved through the establishment of private liquid tank storage terminals 
strategically located near customer endpoints. These terminals are seamlessly integrated with the company’s railway 
loading and unloading infrastructure.
	
These businesses have a impact on the environment in terms of GHG emission, energy, waste generation and water 
consumption. Given the strong growth aspiration of the Company, the challenge is to balance the growth pursued while 
minimising its impact on the environment and have a positive social impact.
	
For a company, strong ESG performance enhances growth potential, supports sustainability, ensures legal and regulatory 
compliance, and acts as an incentive for recruitment and retention of the workforce. We recognise that increasing 
regulatory focus on ESG along with consumer and investor sentiment will make it a core component of the future growth 
of our company.
	
Our initiatives for the three major priority areas of decarbonization, water-positive and talent development. The core 
of this strategy includes initiatives to reduce energy consumption and minimize carbon footprint, conserve and recycle 
water, bring down material consumption and reduce and recycle waste, amongst others, in addition to deploying new 
technologies and enabling a sustainable supply chain. GBL is conscious of the environmental impacts caused during 
supply chain and continually trying to reduce such impacts. By incorporating environmental and social concerns, we 
have generated the economic value which is derived from optimize use of natural resources. GBL is also focused on 
attracting talented individuals from the widest talent pool possible. We are intentional in providing opportunities to 
strengthen employees’ skills and grow their capabilities throughout their career. We are committed to helping people 
reach their full potential and strengthen technical, professional and leadership skills at every level throughout their 
career. We offer employees access to live webinars, learning videos, employee stories to help them shift to a full-time, 
work from home schedule and to support employee mental and social well-being. GBL is committed to creating an 
inclusive workplace focused on attracting, retaining and developing diverse talent that fosters a culture of belonging for 
all employees. Through our colleagues, we learn how to better understand our clients, increase innovation, and reduce 
risk.
	
At GBL, we are committed to our development in the sustainability space reducing environmental risks and sustainability 
is at the heart of what we do as a business, this is what drives our product development and ensures we are providing 
customers with the products they need to grow in an efficient, safe and environmentally sustainable way. The Company 
recognise that sustainability is vital to the long term health of our business and all of our stakeholders. Research shows 
that strong ESG performance is a reliable indicator of both business performance and business growth. We understand 
that ESG is a fundamental pillar in ensuring we maximise our growth potential and continue attracting and maintaining a 
high calibre workforce. The landscape of ESG is everchanging, and it will continue to be a process of adapting to changes 
driven by consumers and investors in responding to an ever-changing legislative environment.
	
We are pleased to highlight that during FY 2023-24, a significant step we have taken towards sustainability. As part of 
our ongoing commitment to reducing our carbon footprint and embracing environmentally friendly practices, we have 
purchased 10 electric car. This initiative aligns with our core values and demonstrates our dedication to a greener future
