If yes, the coverage such system?
 
 
Glenmark has implemented ISO 45001: 2018 Occupational health and safety management system in 7 facilities out of 
10 facilities located in India. The coverage is 100% and is applicable for both permanent and contractual employees. 
 
b. 
What are the processes used to identify work related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis 
by the entity?
 
Hazard Identiﬁcation & Risk Assessment -
 
• 
Department heads, in consultation with the EHS head, are made responsible for identifying hazards and associated 
risks in their activities and equipment, as well as implementing recommended corrective actions.
 
• 
Croner’s “nomogram” tool is used to assess risk rating of hazard based on the factors such as likelihood of occurrence, 
frequency of exposure, extent of harm, severity, and property damage. Engineering, administrative, and PPE controls 
are applied to eliminate or reduce the OHS risk of identiﬁed hazards to an acceptable level.
 
• 
To improve the hazard and near-miss identiﬁcation process, employees of all levels are involved and made responsible 
for risk mitigation in the workplace.
 
• 
The site leadership team consists of the plant heads and all department heads who have been trained on the IS14489 
OHS auditing standard and employees trained on ISO 45001 Internal auditor training course for identifying hazards 
and risks in the plant premises. Daily OHS inspections are performed by the EHS head in collaboration with the 
corresponding area owner, weekly by the plant head, and monthly by other HODs. Every weekend, observations from 
these inspections are collected and shared with the Global EHS head and the Global manufacturing head to review 
its compliance. On a monthly basis, the same information is presented to President of Operations.
 
• 
Internal SOP on “Risk Assessment and Safe Working Procedure” is followed.
 
Nearly & Hazard Management Online Portal-
 
• 
To report near-misses and hazards, employees use an online portal. The portal includes a timeframe for the EHS head 
and area owner to evaluate OHS risk and implement corrective actions based on the OHS risk level of reported hazard 
and near-miss.
 
• 
Internal SOP on “Reporting of Near-Miss & Hazard and Implementation of Corrective Action Through Online Portal” is 
followed.
 
Glenmark sites have adopted “Global Safety Programs” such as Working at Height, Contractor Safety, Chemical Safety, 
Hazardous Energy Isolation (LOTO), Electrical Safety, Conﬁned Space Safety, Emergency Preparedness & Response, 
Machine Guarding, Personal Protective Equipment, Management of Change, Industrial Hygiene, etc. Each month, a plant’s 
cross-functional team reviews the effectiveness of implementation of these programmes with corporate EHS team.
c. 
Whether you have processes for employees to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves 
from such risks. (Y/N)
 
Yes, Glenmark supports worker input and involvement to maintain safety in all manufacturing facilities. All units have 
established safety committees, and employees play a signiﬁcant role in these committees. These committees primary 
duties include identifying workplace risks and hazards, taking corrective action, aiding management in meeting 
safety system standards, and investigating and documenting events. These committees hold regular meetings. 
Several processes are available for employees to report the work related hazards such as:
 
• 
Employees use Nearly & Hazard Online reporting portal to report work-related hazards for effective and on-time 
closure of the Hazards and non-occurrence of near miss incidents
 
• 
OHS Inspections at site conducted by Departmental HOD’s, Site heads helps to report the hazards and close them 
before any incidents can occur.

health safety & training etc. to promote non-occupational medical and healthcare services.

Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy workplace
 
• 
Glenmark is committed to workplace and employee safety.  Creating safe working conditions goes hand in hand with 
operational excellence here.  ‘Safety is everyone’s duty,’ and we at Glenmark make it a point to instill a safety mind-set

• 
Glenmark manufacturing sites have been accredited with the latest OHS management system, ISO 45001:2018. Its 
plan, do, check and act principles are very well implemented to address OHS risks and opportunities in site operations. 
OHS risks such as fall from height, ﬁre, occupation and equipment related injuries, exposure of toxic and ﬂammable 
atmospheres, among other have been addressed through robust mechanisms such as the Global Safety Programs, 
Work Permit System, OHS inspections by site leadership team, on-time and online reporting of Near-Miss & Hazard, 
Hazard Identiﬁcation & Risk Assessment system, Change management system, onsite emergency planning and 
response, Mock-drills and so on which have a signiﬁcant positive impact on employee health and safety. Because of 
the collaborative approach and employee participation in these efforts, the safety culture at the site is very adaptable 
for OHS improvement.
