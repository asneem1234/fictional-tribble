Green 
building and 
Certifications
Opportunity
Green building 
certification offers both 
risks and opportunities
Risk: 
Achieving certification 
requires adherence 
to specific guidelines, 
standards, and 
documentation 
procedures. Meeting 
these requirements can 
be challenging and time-
consuming, particularly 
for developers unfamiliar 
with green building 
practices.
Opportunity 
1.	
Green buildings 
often demonstrate 
long-term cost 
savings through 
reduced energy 
consumption, water 
efficiency, and 
lower maintenance 
expenses. Lower 
operating costs 
can offset the 
initial investment, 
providing financial 
benefits over the 
building’s lifespan.
2.	
Green buildings 
prioritise occupant 
health and 
well-being by 
incorporating 
features such as 
improved indoor 
air quality, natural 
lighting, and access 
to green spaces. 
These factors 
can positively 
impact occupants’ 
productivity, 
satisfaction, and 
overall quality of life.
Sunteck is aligned 
with EDGE-IFC green 
building certification 
for its commercial 
and residential 
projects 
In order to mitigate 
risk of meeting 
the requirements 
of green building 
certification, we have 
taken following steps 
1.	
Investing in 
education 
and training 
programs 
to enhance 
understanding 
of sustainable 
design 
principles, 
green building 
techniques, and 
certification 
requirements.
2.	
Conducting 
precertification

luxury, and comfort but also in achieving all of this sustainably.
	
In the fiscal year 2022-23, we have achieved remarkable milestones that highlight our endurance to sustainability. 
We are proud to announce that our properties are now green buildings pre-certified by prestigious EDGE- 
IFC, a member of the World Bank Group. This certification underscores our focus on creating environmentally 
responsible spaces that minimise their ecological footprint while providing exceptional living experiences. 
Additionally, our corporate head office Sunteck Centre has received LEED Existing building Gold certification 
from U.S Green Building Council.
	
Furthermore, waste management has been a priority for us, and I am delighted to share that both Signature 
Island and Signia Isles have achieved the remarkable feat of zero waste to landfill. We are actively promoting 
a circular economy, reducing waste generation, and implementing effective recycling and waste management 
practices throughout our operations. We have also made significant progress in incorporating recycled materials 
into our construction processes. By utilising 32% recycled materials, we are not only reducing the demand for 
virgin resources but also contributing to the circular economy and minimising waste generation.
	
Our adherence to the safety and well-being of our employees is evident through the achievement of zero fatalities, 
accidents, and lost days. This milestone reflects the rigorous safety protocols and training programs in place, 
ensuring that every individual goes home safely at the end of each day.
	
As we reflect on our accomplishments, we are energised by the limitless potential that lies ahead. We envision a 
world where sustainable real estate practices are the norm, where buildings harmonise with nature, and where 
communities thrive in harmony with their surroundings. This vision drives us to push the boundaries of what is 
possible and continue raising the bar for sustainable development. Together, let us embrace the responsibility we 
have as leaders to build a sustainable real estate industry that not only meets the needs of the present but also 
ensures a brighter future for generations to come

Kamal Khetan

elements are incorporated to ensure that the buildings offer a conducive work environment with ‘thermal’, ‘visual’ 
and ‘ergonomic’ comfort. These elements help minimise stress or discomfort due to loud sounds, insufficient 
light or excessive glare, or thermal stress in order to create ergonomically friendly spaces. We are also bringing in 
‘biophilic design’ elements to help our employees get closer to nature and to promote social interaction, thereby 
improving the emotional well-being of employees. A health and safety training was also conducted at Head office 
for all of Sunteck’s employees.
