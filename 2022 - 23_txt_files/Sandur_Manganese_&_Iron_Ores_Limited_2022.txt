No.
Initiative undertaken
Details of the initiative (Web-link, if any, may be provided

Outcome of 
the initiative
1
Renewable energy-based 
power plant at Kudligi
SMIORE has entered into an equity-based agreement with 
Renew Green Energy Solutions Pvt. Ltd., to develop a state-
of-the-art power plant that combines wind and solar energy to 
generate sustainable electricity.
Expected to generate 
33 MW solar and 9.9 
MW wind energy 
and aims to reduce 
carbon emissions.
2
Renewable Energy 
(Solar Installations)
On-grid and off-grid solar installations at mines to cater the 
electricity need.
Installation of Flat Plate Collector (FPC) solar water heating 
system, solar streetlights, home lighting and solar pumps, etc., 
at registered office, mines, and residential colonies. 
3,79,623.30 kWh 
renewable energy 
generation in 
FY 2022-23.
3
Clean Energy
Two number of Waste Heat Recovery Boilers (WHRB) having 
60 TPH capacity electricity generation were installed to recover 
heat from the waste gas produced by non-recovery type of 
coke oven.
47,60,65,000 kWh 
clean energy was 
generated in FY 2022-
23 that contributed 
to to 85.94%  of 
SMIORE’s total 
energy consumption.
4
Installation of Variable 
Frequency Drive (VFD) for 
ID fans and FD fans
VFDs are installed for the ID fans and FD fans at power plant 
and ferro alloy plant for energy conservation. VFDs allow 
motors to operate at a variable speed hence reduce the energy 
consumption of the equipment and saves energy.
Approximately 2,000 
kWh energy per year 
is conserved.
5
Installation of Air-Cooled 
Condenser (ACC)
Air cooled condenser is a direct dry cooling system that uses 
ambient air to extract the sensible heat and latent heat of 
condensation released by the exhaust steam from turbines.
ACC has almost 
1/3rd water footprint 
as compared to a 
conventional Water-
Cooled Condenser 
(WCC). Approximately, 
2,000 cubic meter 
of water is saved 
per day.
6
Sewage Treatment 
Plant (STP) and Effluent 
Treatment Plant (ETP)
Domestic effluents are treated in state-of-the-art Moving Bed 
Biofilm Reactor (MBBR) technology based STP and trade 
effluents are treated in ETP. Treated water is reused in various 
processes, plantation maintenance and dust suppression.
350 cubic meter 
of water is treated 
every day.
7.	 Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan? Give details in 100 words/web link.
The Company has a Business Continuity Policy (BCP). The main objective of BCP is to maintain business continuity under

• 	 Human life and other living beings;
• 	 Environment and related eco systems;
• 	 Economic losses;
• 	 All stakeholders (such as investors, employees).
To make this BCP more robust, the Company plans training and awareness sessions across the mines and plant locations. 
Apart from training, BCP testing is done periodically to check its efficacy and improving it further based on the gaps observed 
during testing. 
8.	 Disclose any significant adverse impact to the environment, arising from the value chain of the entity. What 
mitigation or adaptation measures have been taken by the entity in this regard: Nil
