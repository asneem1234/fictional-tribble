(R/O)

risk / opportunity
In case of risk, approach to 
adapt or mitigate
Financial implications of 
the risk or opportunity 
(Indicate positive or 
negative implications)
1.
Energy 
Consumption
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk:
The operational activities of 
the company necessitate a 
substantial quantity of energy, 
particularly in relation to the 
recycling process.
Opportunity:
Ganesha has the potential to 
transition to the utilization of 
energy-efficient technologies 
like solar panels, resulting in 
reduced operational expenses 
and a diminished carbon 
footprint.
The Company is committed 
to efficiently utilize its 
resources and ensure 
minimum consumption 
in all its processes. With 
energy saving initiatives, 
process optimisation and 
overall operations efficiency, 
the Company shall be 
able to optimise its energy 
consumption and reduce 
carbon emissions.
Augmenting its efforts in 
using alternate sources 
of energy, the Company 
has also partnered with a 
leading IPP for supplying of 
17.43 MWp Solar Power for 
captive consumption and 
such supply has been started 
during the year under review.
Negative:
High energy demands, 
especially in recycling, can 
burden operational costs, 
decrease profitability, and 
weaken competitiveness due 
to higher expenses.
Positive:
Integrating energy-efficient 
technologies leads to 
significant cost savings over 
the long term.
2.
Waste 
Management
Opportunity
Ganesha’s core emphasis is 
on processing of Polyethylene 
Terephthalate (PET) waste. 
Go Rewise, launched by the 
Company, envisions to close the 
plastic recycling loop, fulfilling 
the demand for quality recycled 
packaging products.
-
Positive:
Efforts are being made to 
grasp the opportunity of 
recycling other plastic waste 
in view of its accelerated 
demand. Moreover, managing 
waste at each stage of the 
manufacturing process has 
direct impact on achieving the 
resource efficiency and may 
result to
positive financial impact.

3.
Materials 
Sourcing & 
Efficiency
Risk and 
Opportunity
From a risk perspective, 
Ganesha may encounter 
difficulties in procuring an 
adequate supply of PET 
waste for recycling purposes. 
Inefficient material sourcing 
can result in escalated costs 
and diminished profit margins, 
exerting a negative impact on 
the company’s financial well-
being.
Conversely, enhancing material 
sourcing and efficiency 
can yields superior-quality 
recycled products, curtail 
production costs, and minimize 
environmental footprints.
Ganesha maintains an 
extensive PET waste 
collection network, ensuring 
cost-effective material 
acquisition. In its subsidiaries, 
it has established rPET chips 
plant and washing plant in 
South India and Nepal to 
further strengthen its raw 
material sourcing platform.
Negative:
Ineffective material sourcing 
methods might lead to 
increased expenses and 
reduced profit margins, 
ultimately affecting the 
financial health.
Positive:
Enhancing material sourcing 
and efficiency benefits the 
company financially by 
reducing costs, improving 
product quality and 
minimizing environmental 
impact.
4.
Business 
Model 
Resilience
Opportunity
Business Model Resilience 
represents a notable 
opportunity for Ganesha, 
enabling it to adapt and 
thrive amidst evolving market 
conditions and challenges, such 
as regulatory changes and shifts 
in consumer preferences.
-
Positive:
Ganesha can expand its 
market share, bolster sales 
revenue, and attract a broader 
customer base.
5.
Growing 
Demand for 
Sustainable 
Products
Opportunity
Ganesha recognizes the 
changing consumer trend 
towards sustainability and 
the increasing desire for eco-
friendly products. To leverage 
this opportunity, Ganesha has 
positioned itself as a premier 
PET recycling and processing 
leader. This allows Ganesha 
to supply high-quality, 
sustainable materials to the 
textile and packaging sectors, 
addressing the rising demand 
for environmentally conscious 
alternatives.
-
Positive:
Ganesha’s focus on providing 
high-quality, sustainable 
materials like recycled 
polyester fibres and yarns 
aligns with the rising demand 
for eco-friendly choices. This 
strategy can lead to positive 
financial outcomes through 
increased sales, premium 
pricing, market leadership, 
enhanced brand reputation.

Briefly describe the waste management practices 
adopted in your establishments. Describe the 
strategy adopted by your company to reduce

The main area of focus for Ganesha is centred on the processing of PET plastic 
waste. Consequently, Ganesha has taken measures to ensure that 100% of this 
category of waste is deemed suitable for recycling. This approach guarantees 
that there is negligible residual waste generated from the PET plastic processing 
activities.
Additionally, it follows a practice of processing all incoming materials to ensure 
that they are recyclable. Any waste generated during the processing of PET 
plastic is subjected to recycling as part of the company’s operational procedures.
Furthermore, Ganesha conducts its operations without employing any 
hazardous chemicals during the PET plastic processing phase. This aspect aligns 
with the nature of Ganesha ‘s business and its commitment to operating in an 
environmentally conscious manner.
