Risk and 
Opportunity
The 
financial 
market 
is 
much 
underpenetrated, and the potential 
size of the opportunity is projected 
to be as high as that of MFIs. SFBs are 
not only engaged in supporting people 
who do not have bank accounts or 
who live in rural areas but they are also 
involved in assisting the urban poor.
Small Finance Banks’ success will 
be determined by ease of doing 
business and quality of client service. 
Customers are currently uncertain 
about 
the 
success 
of 
numerous 
financial offerings.
Given 
the 
track 
record of operating in 
underbanked regions 
of the country, the 
Bank has developed 
proficiency to endure 
the initial operating 
pain by listing the 
gaps in the society 
and offering tailor-
made 
banking 
solutions to address 
the 
development 
concerns. 
In 
that 
process, the Bank has 
identified enormous 
prospects, 
goodwill 
and synergies for the 
future. To achieve this 
objective, the Bank 
employs 
a 
social 
business 
strategy 
with a Triple Bottom 
Line 
approach, 
e m p h a s i s i n g 
People, Planet, and 
Prosperity.
 
Over 
the 
years, 
ESAF 
has 
developed 
a 
comprehensive grasp 
of the market, allowing 
it to meet the financial 
needs of prospective 
customers. The Bank’s 
engagement 
with 
its target customer 
segments 
and 
knowledge of related 
s o c i o e c o n o m i c 
dynamics enables it 
to establish effective 
credit and operational 
procedures, 
identify 
potential 
market 
demand, and leverage 
its existing operating 
network to introduce 
new products, expand 
its customer base, and 
expand its product 
offering.

implications
The presence of numerous informal 
credit channels in distant areas, where 
small finance banks have a presence, 
is advantageous for reaching the 
unbanked people.
SFBs have rapidly expanded their 
branch networks to meet regulatory 
obligations. With a greater emphasis 
on diversifying their portfolios and 
broadening their reach, SFBs are 
anticipated to record greater growth 
as they enter newer geographies with 
a wide array of services.
Microlenders 
were 
marginally 
impacted by the liquidity crisis hitting 
NBFCs in India. The lenders that 
relied on NBFCs for finance curtailed 
disbursements and sought alternative 
sources of funding. Better access 
to retail and wholesale deposits is 
anticipated to result in market share 
gains for SMBs.
In the initial years of their banking 
operations, SFBs confronted various 
obstacles, such as adapting to banking 
technology, increasing retail deposits, 
establishing additional branches, and 
training personnel.
To fulfil its strategy, 
the 
Bank 
has 
implemented 
a 
number of policies, 
including 
an 
E n v i r o n m e n t a l , 
Social, 
and 
G o v e r n a n c e 
(“ESG”) 
policy. 
It 
is 
committed 
to 
(i) 
protecting the 
environment 
and 
ensuring sustainable 
development, 
(ii) 
promoting financial 
inclusion 
 
and 
gender 
equality 
through specialised 
financial 
services, 
and (iii) establishing 
a 
governance 
framework to ensure 
a c c o u n t a b i l i t y , 
transparency, 
and 
compliance 
with 
internal and external 
ESG 
standards 
in 
accordance with its 
ESG policy.
Being a social bank 
with 
a 
legacy 
of 
building social capital, 
there is no specific 
negative to report.
-  Increasing retail liabilities will be a 
challenge for SFBs due to the fact 
that it faces direct competition from 
existing banks.
-  The ‘traditional banking’ habit needs 
to evolve, and workers would have 
to become more customer-focussed 
and technologically knowledgeable 
in light of the country’s changing 
banking environment.
-  Building 
the 
liability 
product 
portfolio will be a challenge given 
the low ticket size liability customer 
base and the ability to 
gain 
customer trust.
-  Controlling NPAs as an unfavourable 
monsoon and a slowdown in the 
industrial sector will have a negative 
impact on farm loans and MSME 
loans.

 The Board has formulated a Performance Evaluation Policy including the questionnaire for performance evaluation 
of the Individual Directors, Committees of the Board, Chairman, Managing Director and CEO and the Board as a 
whole. The questionnaire designed for the performance evaluation covers various aspects of performance including 
the structure of the Board, meetings of the Board, functions of the Board, role and responsibilities of the Board, 
governance and compliance, evaluation of risks, grievance redressal for Investor, conflict of interest, Stakeholder 
value and responsibility, the relationship among Directors, Director competency, Board procedures, processes, 
functioning and effectiveness is circulated to all the Directors of the Bank for the annual performance evaluation.
 
 Given the nature of the business of the Bank, the relevance of the above is largely restricted to information 
technology (IT) capex. Greater adoption of digital platforms has brought in increased efficiencies of operations 
and additionally ensures substantially reduced dependency on paper. Further, product performance and impact 
studies are undertaken to review the social performance.
 
During the FY 22-23, the Bank adopted an E-Signature process for disbursing micro loans.
 
 Given the nature of the business of the Bank, the consumption of resources is limited. With the Green Protocol, 
Environment Policy and ESG Policy in place, the Bank makes the best effort to procure energy efficient products. 
Also, the Bank procures many of the products from the local vendors thereby being responsible in the supply chain. 
This empowers the local vendors thereby increasing their socio-economic status. The Bank is working on a green- 
procurement policy and ethical code of conduct for vendors.
