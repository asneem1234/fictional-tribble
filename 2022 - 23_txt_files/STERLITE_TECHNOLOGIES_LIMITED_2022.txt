GOVERNANCE, LEADERSHIP AND OVERSIGHT
7.	
Statement by director responsible for the business 
responsibility report, highlighting ESG related 
challenges, targets and achievements (listed entity has 
flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure) 
Owing to massive paradigm shift over the last couple of 
years due to the pandemic and economic downturn, the 
way societies and businesses strategise and operate 
has changed. As these changes in socioeconomic 
archetypes continue to get stronger across the globe, 
the role of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) 
adherence in amplifying the interests of the Triple 
Bottom Line is intensifying. Climate change concerns, 
sustainable development and other environmental, 
social and governance (ESG) concerns have become a 
key agenda of every discussion across government and 
corporate boardrooms, globally.
Our ESG goals include sustainable sourcing and 
manufacturing practices, net-zero emissions, 
ensuring water positivity across STL locations 
globally, zero waste to landfill at manufacturing 
plants, lifecycle assessment of products and green 
product development. To ensure transformation that is 
sustainable, action on ESG must be taken across the 
value chain as well as in communities. We are doing 
so by working with partners - up and down stream to 
minimise packaging, waste and furthermore, mitigating 
global issues like gender inequality, lack of quality 
healthcare and digital education for marginalised 
communities and conserving the environment. Above 
all, we are focused on bridging the digital divide in 
communities we serve and operate, worldwide.
We have made steady progress in our net zero 
emissions goal by 2030. Likewise, our other ESG 
goals such as Zero Waste to Landfill (ZWL), Zero 
Liquid Discharge (ZLD) and becoming water positive 
by 2030, 100% sustainable sourcing by 2030 are well 
on track. Further, we have designed and implemented 
digital-driven social impact programmes, strengthened 
through partnerships across education, healthcare 
and the environment. Through products like STL Garv 
and projects like Bharatnet, Mahanet and others, 
we have facilitated universal and affordable internet 
access across rural regions. Moreover, we have made 
significant progress on the ambitious 5-5-5 million goals 
we set out to accomplish by the year 2025. These 
involve transforming five million lives from marginalised 
communities, undertaking five million plantations, 
and replenishing a similar amount of water in water 
stressed communities.
All of the above-mentioned initiatives and actions

Permanent employees
Yes, we are committed to implement and adhere to the best ethical and business 
practices across our operations globally. This, however, is not achievable without 
the assistance of their stakeholders and employees.
All the employees are expected to uphold the code of business conduct and ethics.
Our company’s whistle-blower policy is designed to allow employees, off-roll 
employees and workers as well as business partners to voice concerns about any 
malpractice, impropriety, abuse, or misconduct at an early and appropriate stage, 
without fear of persecution, discrimination, or disadvantage. The policy has also 
been extended to external stakeholders such as vendors, customers, and others.
We have a prevention of sexual harassment committee (PSHC) that oversees all 
complaints. Annual trainings are also provided to employees to ensure they are 
aware of various aspects that are covered under POSH and can raise concerns 
through the right channels.
To enable a healthy work environment, our company launched STL Care in February 
2021 to cater to wellness, primarily mental, and emotional well-being of our employees.

a.	
Whether an occupational health and safety 
management system has been implemented by the 
entity? (Yes/ No). If yes, the coverage of such system? 
Yes, our company has well-organised occupational 
Health & Safety management system implemented 
and maintained as per the company’s procedures and 
legal requirements. The roles and responsibilities of the 
team are defined, and regular monitoring is carried out 
through management reviews. All the manufacturing 
facilities are ISO 45001 and 14001 certified. 
b.	
What are the processes used to identify work-

non-routine basis by the entity?
We are an ISO 45001 certified organisation. We 
have an internal tool to assess risks associated 
with the processes and risk assessment is done 
on a project basis (routine & non-routine basis). All 
manufacturing processes are governed by a Quality, 
Environment, Health and Safety policy (QEHS) and 
each area is also monitored through an ISO 14001 
certified Environment Management System and ISO 
45001 Occupational Health and Safety management 
system. This helps the company to maintain a 
high environmental and safety standard across its 
facilities as well as identify gaps and proactively 
mitigate them through appropriate action.
Policies such as Quality, Environment, Health 
and Safety policy, Hazard Identification and 
Risk Assessment (HIRA) and standard operating 
processes are available to workers for awareness 
concerning hazards, risks and injury or ill health while 
working. Work-related incidents are investigated 
via accident and investigation procedures. It was 
also noted that the plant implementation committee 
for each manufacturing units is responsible for 
implementing initiatives such as Programme Abhay 
for bringing about cultural transformation in current 
EHS practices and further optimise it.

We have put in place several systems and processes 
that provide our employees with a safe work 
environment without any fear of injury or adverse effects 
on their health. To ensure complete readiness for the 
unlikely event of an emergency, we work on three fronts:
•	
First, our technological foundation and compliance 
guarantee that the systems have a solid base 
by enforcing strict standards that oversee every 
procedure.
•	
Second, leadership and management systems 
supervise the implementation of these policies.
•	
Last, but not the least, consistent awareness is 
ensured through the transmission of information, and 
behavior.
Policies such as Quality, Environment, Health and Safety 
policy, HIRA and standard operating processes are 
available to workers for awareness concerning hazards, 
risks and injury or ill health while working. Work-related 
incidents are investigated via accident and investigation 
procedures.

Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero 
Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its coverage 
and implementation.
Yes, 100% of our Indian manufacturing units are zero-
liquid discharge certified. Effluent treatment (ETP) and 
multi-effective evaporator (MEE) plants are installed, 
in addition to several in-plant modifications to our 
processes help we ensure this. A detailed study of 
parameters has been done on the wastewater before 
its treatment in the ETP which has in turn helped reduce 
the load on the plant. The process includes wastewater 
from the scrubber process, silicon tetrachloride (SiCl4), 
and softener plants collected at the ETP. Through 
chemical treatments, solid particles and chlorine in the 
water are removed and then fed with steam in the MEE 
plant through a three-stage centrifuging process to 
remove salt in the water. This recycled water is again 
used in the boiler and scrubber processes. Effluent and 
sewage treatment plants have helped us ensure zero 
liquid discharge at all our plants in Aurangabad, which 
is traditionally a drought-prone region.
Zero liquid discharge (ZLD) Certified plants includes.
Shendra draw plant, Shendra glass plant, Waluj plant, 
Rakholi plant and Dadra plant.
The Zero Liquid Discharge certification has been done 
by DQS with reference to Circular Water Management, 
Compliances, and ISO 14021:2016 Environmental labels 
and declarations (Type II environmental labelling – 
verifying implementation and overseeing certification). 
The certification was preceded by a detailed audit and 
documentation exercise that found STL’s ZLD performance 
in consonance with globally accepted standards.

Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report
9.	
Briefly describe the waste management practices 
adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy 
adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous 
and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and 
the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
Waste management is one of the most fundamental ways 
we drive our sustainability agenda. Our approach to 
waste management is to eliminate waste and optimally 
use available resources. We ensure that the vendors 
we choose to do business with are also environmentally 
conscious and are approved by the Pollution Control 
Board. We ensure all our employees and workers are 
well-informed about the importance of recycling and waste 
segregation at the corporate office and the manufacturing 
facility. We aim to have all our plants across the globe 
certified with Zero Waste to Landfills (ZWL) over the next 
few years. 
We also monitor our hazardous and non-hazardous 
waste, monthly. While we ensure our processes comply 
with stringent waste management rules in the countries 
we operate, we also verify the approaches our 
recyclers adopt. This assures us that they are operating 
according to the prescribed laws and our byproducts or 
waste are further reused, promoting a circular economy, 
especially for optic fibre, cables and LSZH.
Our company has started using co-processing in 
partnership with cement companies as one of the 
disposal and management solutions, which helps 
convert waste to energy. Further, we have prioritised 
opportunities for reusing waste by enhancing the 
usage of what was generated from our operations as 
a resource for our industry or others. Reusing waste 
helps save natural resources while manufacturing new 
products, as well as generating revenue in due course of 
operations. This entire initiative also involves monitoring 
each type of waste generated, its source, and so on. 
This is essential to increase process efficiency and 
identify preventive mechanisms to reduce generation. 
This entire effort has helped our company become 
the world’s first integrated optic fibre and cables 
manufacturer to be Zero Waste to Landfill (ZWL) certified 
for 100% of its manufacturing units that are operational 
for over a year. It has helped us optimize resource 
utilisation and operate in a more efficient and eco-
friendly manner by treating waste as a resource; which is 
at the crux of our waste management approach.

Ensuring zero liquid/effluent 
discharge into communities
Water audits were conducted for all Indian plants. 
Water conservation and harvesting measure were 
identified for each plant as part of the audit.
 To ensure zero discharge, a detailed study of 
parameters has been done on the wastewater 
before its treatment in the ETP which has in turn 
helped reduce the load on the plant.
https://www.stl.tech/esg/
Each of our manufacturing units 
in Aurangabad and Silvassa 
are all zero-liquid discharge 
certified. Effluent treatment 
(ETP) and multi-effective 
evaporator (MEE) plants 
installed, in addition to several 
in-plant modifications to our 
processes help us ensure this.
