BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 
   FOREWORD 
Over the past few years, sustainability reporting is gaining importance globally as an important communication tool 
for corporates to display their commitment of being a sustainable and responsible business. The Indian reporting 
scenario is also rapidly evolving in line with the global trends wherein corporates are expected to maintain 
transparency and accountability in reporting. 
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”), regulator of capital markets in India, has put in place the 
Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (“BRSR”) framework which requires listed companies to 
disclose information under the nine principles of the National Guidelines on Responsible Business Conduct. The 
BRSR disclosure has become mandatory from FY 2022-23 onwards for the top 1,000 Indian listed companies by 
market capitalization. 
Staying strong on our commitment of being a responsible business adopting BRSR framework from FY 2022-23 to

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy

We strive to reduce waste and recycle as much as possible. Our waste primarily comprises of food, waste, paper, 
plastic and e-waste 
Curbing generation of plastic waste: We have stopped procurement of plastic stationery and encourage our 
employees to use bottles made from environment friendly materials at our offices to reduce the number of 
plastic bottles being discarded after use. All our facilities use 100% biodegradable plastic garbage bags to 
collect and dispose off dry and wet waste. 
Reducing paper and printing consumption: We have implemented strong measures like digitising our 
processes to reduce the need for paper. Further minimising the usage of paper across offices is an ongoing 
activity. Customer accounts have now transitioned to digital opening. The documents required as supporting are 
also uploaded digitally; accounts are being opened without any paper consumption.  
Paper based Office stationeries also have now been stopped apart from the mandatory ones. 
E waste management: Our E-waste broadly includes computers, servers, scanners, UPSs, Batteries, Air 
conditioners etc. All such E-wastes are being disposed of through registered E-waste vendors.
