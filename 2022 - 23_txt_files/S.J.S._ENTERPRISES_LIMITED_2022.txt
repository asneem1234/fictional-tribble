1.
Energy 
Management
Risk
In the manufacturing process, 
significant amounts of energy 
are commonly utilized for 
various purposes, such as 
powering machinery, providing 
heating and cooling, and 
lighting facilities. Consequently, 
these activities entail substantial 
energy costs, which can pose a 
financial burden on the company. 
Moreover, any interruptions in 
the energy supply, fluctuations in 
energy prices, or other energy-
related disruptions may impact 
the company's operations, 
leading to product delays, 
quality issues, and disruptions in 
the supply chain.
It is imperative to foster a culture 
of energy efficiency within the 
organization and regularly monitor 
and analyse energy consumption 
data 
to 
ensure 
continuous 
improvement. With this objective in 
mind, the Company has undertaken 
significant initiatives. These include 
the installation of solar panels at 
its factories, procuring wind power, 
and substantially reducing electricity 
consumption from BESCOM. The 
facility actively pursues various 
measures to enhance energy

carbon footprint.
Furthermore, the Company has been 
exploring investments in energy-
efficient technologies and increasing 
its procurement of power from 
renewable sources. Notably, the 
Bengaluru facility has achieved LEED 
Gold certification (Leadership in 
Energy Efficiency and Environmental 
Design) from the US Green 
Building Council, underscoring its 
commitment to energy efficiency 
and environmentally sustainable 
practices. 
POSITIVE
Although the installation of 
solar panels, procurement of 
wind power, and other capital 
investments may initially 
incur costs, the long-term 
implications of these actions 
can lead to significant cost 
reductions. 
Consequently, 
this positive impact on the 
Company's financials can be 
observed over time.

2.
Water & Waste 
Management
Risk
The manufacturing process 
requires large quantities of 
water for various purposes, 
including cooling, cleaning, 
and processing. This results in 
high water consumption, which 
incurs significant costs and 
strains local water resources. 
Furthermore, the manufacturing 
process generates wastewater 
that 
contains 
pollutants, 
posing potential risks to the 
environment and human health 
if not adequately treated.
The Company has implemented a 
comprehensive strategy for water 
and wastewater management that 
adheres to best practices and industry 
standards. As part of this strategy, 
the Company has adopted water 
conservation measures, such as the 
installation of water-efficient fixtures 
like low-flow toilets and faucets. 
Additionally, the Company ensures 
that its staff is adequately trained 
in proper water and wastewater 
management techniques.
To address wastewater treatment, 
the Company has established 
mechanisms in place. The liquid 
waste from the Sewage Treatment 
Plant (STP) undergoes processing in 
the STP plant, where it is converted 
into sludge. The treated water 
derived from this process is reused 
for purposes such as toilet flushing 
and gardening. Similarly, the liquid 
waste from the Effluent Treatment 
Plant (ETP) is processed in the ETP 
plant, resulting in the conversion of 
liquid waste into ETP sludge.
To ensure the safe and responsible 
disposal of waste, the sludge is 
handed over to authorized vendors 
who specialize in its appropriate 
management and disposal. Through 
these measures, the Company 
demonstrates its commitment to 
effective water and wastewater 
management practices, safeguarding 
the environment and promoting 
sustainability.
POSITIVE
Implementing effective water 
management practices, such 
as reducing water consumption 
and improving wastewater 
treatment, can yield positive 
financial implications for the 
facility. By optimizing water 
usage and minimizing wastage, 
the facility can significantly 
reduce water expenses, leading 
to cost savings in the long 
run. Additionally, improved 
wastewater treatment can help 
the facility avoid regulatory 
fines, which can protect the 
company's financial resources. 
Moreover, by demonstrating 
responsible water management 
practices, 
the 
Company 
can enhance its reputation, 
potentially 
attracting 
environmentally conscious 
customers and investors, 
thereby positively impacting 
sales, and revenue. Ultimately, 
investing in water conservation 
and wastewater treatment 
measures can lead to long-
term financial sustainability 
and competitiveness for the 
facility.

3.
Waste & 
Hazardous 
Materials 
Management
Risk
The manufacturing process 
necessitates the consumption 
of finite resources such as raw 
materials, energy, and water. 
Acquiring and utilizing these 
resources can incur substantial 
costs, 
highlighting 
the 
importance of waste reduction to 
achieve significant cost savings 
for the Company. Improper 
management of waste generated 
during 
the 
manufacturing 
process 
can 
be 
both 
environmentally damaging and 
expensive in terms of disposal. 
Therefore, 
implementing 
proper waste management 
practices is essential to mitigate 
environmental harm and reduce 
associated expenses.
The Company's current waste 
management plan includes various 
measures aimed at mitigating 
the risks associated with waste 
and materials management. To 
ensure effective waste disposal, the 
Company engages the services of 
waste collection agents appointed by 
the Local Authorities. These agents 
conduct regular waste pickups as per 
scheduled intervals.
In regard to hazardous waste, the 
Company has implemented a well-
defined plan to ensure proper 
identification and storage practices, 
minimizing the risk of spillage. 
Hazardous waste is exclusively 
disposed of through authorized 
parties, and meticulous records 
of hazardous waste disposal are 
maintained.
Additionally, the Company takes 
responsibility for categorizing 
waste into three distinct categories, 
reflecting the level of risk associated 
with each. These categories are 
accompanied 
by 
appropriate 
packaging and labelling, facilitating 
easy identification during emergency 
situations.
By adhering to these waste 
management practices, the Company 
demonstrates its commitment to 
environmental responsibility and 
the promotion of a safe working 
environment.
POSITIVE
Taking proactive measures to 
reduce waste in production 
processes can have a positive 
financial implication for the 
company. By implementing 
strategies that minimize waste 
generation 
and 
improve 
efficiency, the company can 
significantly reduce production 
costs. This includes cost 
savings related to the disposal 
or recycling of excess waste 
materials. Additionally, by 
optimizing the use of resources 
such as energy, water, and 
raw materials, the company 
can lower its operational 
expenses and enhance overall 
productivity. Adopting waste 
reduction 
strategies 
not 
only promotes sustainability 
but 
also 
contributes 
to 
improved profitability and 
competitiveness in the market.

occupational health and safety 
regulations is imperative, as 
employers are legally obligated to 
provide a safe and healthy work 
environment. Failure to do so can 
lead to legal liabilities, financial 
penalties, 
and 
reputational 
damage for the company. It is 
crucial for companies to prioritize 
proper management of these 
risks to ensure the well-being of 
their employees and maintain 
compliance with occupational 
health and safety regulations.
The Company has implemented an 
effective employee health and safety

the provision of appropriate PPE, 
including gloves, safety glasses, 
shoes, and respirators, plays a crucial 
role in safeguarding employees from 
workplace hazards.
By prioritizing employee health 
and safety through comprehensive 
management systems, effective 
training, and the implementation 
of necessary safety measures, the 
Company fosters a secure work 
environment, 
mitigates 
risks, 
and ensures the well-being of its 
employees.

Supply Chain 
Management
Risk
Recognizing and addressing 
supply 
chain 
risks 
is 
of 
paramount 
importance 
to

expenses, and reputational 
damage. The global nature 
of the supply chain exposes 
the Company to a range of 
risks, encompassing supply 
chain disruptions, geopolitical 
uncertainties, 
economic 
fluctuations, 
and 
natural 
disasters, all of which can impact 
the quality and functionality of 
the end product. By proactively 
identifying and mitigating these 
risks, the Company can fortify its 
supply chain resilience, enhance 
operational efficiency, and 
safeguard its brand reputation
To mitigate the risks associated 
with supply chain disruptions, the 
Company has implemented several 
key strategies. Firstly, it maintains a 
diversified supplier base and fosters 
strong relationships with multiple 
suppliers. This approach reduces 
dependency on a single source and 
enhances the Company's ability to 
respond to disruptions. Furthermore, 
the Company has developed a 
comprehensive contingency plan 
that is regularly reviewed and 
updated to ensure its effectiveness in 
mitigating potential disruptions. By 
proactively assessing and reviewing 
the supply chain, the Company 
identifies areas of vulnerability and 
takes necessary measures to address 
them. As part of its risk management 
approach, the Company conducts 
random visits to suppliers, enabling 
it to monitor and verify the 
smooth functioning of operations. 
Through these proactive measures 
and continuous monitoring, the 
Company minimizes the impact 
of supply chain disruptions and 
maintains a reliable and resilient 
supply chain network.
NEGATIVE

in production, escalated costs, 
and damage to the company's 
reputation. 
Moreover, 
global supply chain risks, 
such as political instability, 
economic 
volatility, 
and 
natural disasters, can further

on the company. Therefore, 
it is of utmost importance 
to proactively identify and 
mitigate these risks to ensure 
the continued reliability and 
efficiency of the supply chain, 
thereby safeguarding the 
company from significant 
financial implications.

Material 
Sourcing & 
Efficiency
Risk
The selection of materials 
plays a crucial role in the 
manufacturing process of the 
Company. It is essential to 
carefully choose materials that 
meet specific criteria to ensure 
the durability and quality of 
the finished products. One of 
the primary factors to consider 
is the ability of the materials 
to withstand the challenging 
environmental conditions that 
the parts are likely to encounter 
throughout their operational life. 
For instance, parts exposed to 
extreme temperatures, whether 
high or low, require materials 
that can endure these conditions 
without experiencing brittleness 
or degradation. Additionally, 
materials must be resistant to the 
deteriorating effects of moisture 
and UV radiation, as exposure to 
these elements can compromise 
the integrity and visual appeal of 
the parts. By carefully selecting 
materials that meet these 
requirements, the Company can 
ensure that its products maintain 
their performance and aesthetics 
over time.
The Company employs various 
measures to ensure the resilience of 
their products when exposed to harsh 
weather conditions. One common 
practice involves applying protective 
coatings or finishes to the surface of 
the parts, safeguarding them against 
damage, fading, or discoloration. 
Additionally, the Company utilizes 
specialized materials, such as 
heat-resistant plastics or metals, 
capable of withstanding extreme 
temperatures. Rigorous testing 
is another integral aspect, where 
the products undergo simulations 
of various weather conditions to 
assess their performance in harsh 
environments. These meticulous 
measures enable the Company to 
manufacture products that exhibit 
durability, reliability, and exceptional 
performance 
across 
diverse 
environmental conditions.
Under the Green Inspired section 
of the Company's Sustainable 
Procurement Policy, a commitment 
is made to foster an environmentally 
friendly and responsible value chain in 
compliance with local environmental 
laws and regulations. The Company 
places particular emphasis on 
reducing 
carbon 
emissions, 
minimizing water usage, managing 
hazardous materials and toxic 
waste, and promoting the adoption 
of renewable energy sources. They 
endorse the principles of "reduce, 
reuse, and recycle" to minimize 
waste generation and encourage 
responsible resource consumption, 
including sustainable practices in 
packaging materials. Furthermore, 
the Company expects its suppliers 
to establish and maintain a robust 
Quality 
Management 
System 
while adhering to relevant local 
regulations, registrations, training 
programs, management reviews, 
and internal audits. Suppliers are 
also encouraged to monitor and 
minimize their environmental impact 
by embracing green initiatives and 
sustainable practices.
NEGATIVE
The procurement of materials 
directly influences the financial 
outlook of the Company, 
as the cost of raw materials 
constitutes 
a 
significant 
expense that can impact 
profitability 
substantially. 
Fluctuations in material prices, 
scarcity, or market conditions 
can pose challenges and 
increase costs, potentially 
affecting 
the 
Company's 
financial performance.
POSITIVE
Conversely, the adoption 
of 
sustainable 
and 
environmentally 
friendly 
materials, although initially 
entailing higher costs, can 
yield long-term cost savings. 
Such materials are often more 
durable and boast extended 
lifespans, reducing the need 
for frequent replacements and 
repairs. Additionally, utilizing 
sustainable materials can 
contribute to the Company's 
efforts in minimizing its 
environmental 
footprint, 
potentially reducing waste 
management and disposal 
costs. 
Consequently, 
the 
strategic 
selection 
of 
sustainable materials can result 
in financial benefits and align 
the Company's operations 
with its commitment to 
environmental stewardship.

workforce with the necessary 
skills, 
the 
Company 
ensures 
that employees are proficient in 
operating and maintaining the 
new

effectively. 
Furthermore, 
the 
Company 
regularly reviews and updates its 
cybersecurity measures to safeguard 
against potential cyber threats 
that may arise in connection with 
the adoption of new technologies. 
By prioritizing cybersecurity, the 
Company mitigates the associated 
risks and ensures the protection of 
its valuable data and technological 
assets.
POSITIVE
The Company recognizes that 
advancements in technology 
can greatly influence its 
financial

To ensure prudent decision-
making, 
the 
Company 
conducts thorough evaluations 
of the costs and benefits 
associated with adopting new 
technologies. By carefully 
assessing 
the 
potential 
financial impact, the Company 
can make informed decisions 
about which technologies to 
embrace, considering both 
short-term and long-term 
financial implications. This 
strategic approach allows the 
Company to capitalize on the 
opportunities presented by 
technological advancements 
while mitigating any potential 
financial risks..

The Company maintains a positive working relationship with its vendors, suppliers, and other service 
providers, and incorporates them into its business practices and growth strategy.
To ensure sustainable sourcing practices, the Company has established a set of procedures for 
selecting, evaluating, re-evaluating, and monitoring the performance of both new and current suppliers 
of raw materials and outsourced jobs. These procedures help the Company to identify and partner 
with suppliers who align with their values and sustainable practices, and to continuously monitor their 
performance to ensure compliance with environmental standards and regulations. This approach helps 
the Company to promote responsible sourcing practices throughout their supply chain, minimizing the 
environmental impact of their operations.
The Company's Sustainable Procurement policy includes the Green Inspired section, which aims to create 
an environmentally responsible value chain that adheres to local environmental laws and regulations.

as well as promoting the use of renewable energy sources. The policy recommends the "reduce, reuse, 
and recycle" approach to minimize waste and ensure responsible resource consumption, including for 
packaging materials. The Company also requires suppliers to establish a Quality Management System

The Company understands the importance of product marking in promoting effective reclamation and 
recycling of products. The Company has a standardized product marking system in place that ensures 
each part produced is clearly labelled with the raw material code. This marking includes information 
about the type of material used in the product, such as >ABS< for Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene or 
>PMMA< for Polymethyl Methacrylate.
The product marking serves as a critical identification tool for end users and recycling facilities, allowing 
them to easily identify and sort different types of materials used in the products. This ensures that 
materials can be efficiently separated and processed for recycling or reusing, minimizing waste and 
promoting environmental sustainability.
By implementing a robust product marking system, the Company demonstrates their commitment to 
promoting environmentally responsible practices in reclaiming their products for reusing, recycling, 
and proper disposal at the end of their lifecycle. This ensures that their products are managed in an 
environmentally sustainable manner, minimizing their impact on the environment, and contributing to

Is there a mechanism available to receive and redress grievances for the following categories of employees and

Yes/No (If yes, then give details of the mechanism in brief)
Permanent Workers
Yes, the Company is committed to providing an inclusive and supportive work environment for all 
employees. As part of this commitment, we have established a grievance redressal mechanism to address 
any concerns or issues that employees may have.
Upon receipt of a grievance, our internal grievance committee will review the matter and utilize an 
escalation matrix to determine the most appropriate course of action. This matrix outlines a set of steps 
that are designed to facilitate the resolution of the grievance, taking into consideration various factors 
such as the severity of the grievance, the seniority of the involved parties, and the timeline for resolution.
Our escalation process comprises several stages, including:
A. 	 Informal Discussion with Supervisor:
	
The first stage of our escalation process involves encouraging employees to speak with their manager 
before filing a formal grievance. This informal discussion can often help to bridge communication 
gaps and allow for issues to be resolved quickly and effectively.
B.	 Formal Written Grievance:
	
If the informal discussion is not successful in resolving the grievance, employees can file a formal 
written grievance. We have developed a grievance form that employees can use to document their 
concerns.
C. 	 Evaluation of Grievance:
	
Once a formal grievance has been received, the grievance committee will evaluate the matter and 
determine the appropriate course of action. This can include mediation or other forms of conflict 
resolution.
D. 	 Conduct a Formal Investigation:
	
In some cases, a formal investigation may be necessary to gather additional information or evidence. 
This may involve interviewing witnesses and gathering documents in order to arrive at a fair and 
impartial resolution.
Upon conclusion of the investigation, the grievance committee will work towards creating a resolution 
that is fair and equitable for all parties involved. Our aim is to ensure that grievances are resolved in a 
timely and impartial manner, and that employees feel supported and valued throughout the process.

coverage such system?
Yes, the Company has implemented a management system for occupational health and safety. The 
coverage of such system includes –
1)	 Pre-employment and Annual Medical Check-up:
	
These check-ups help to identify health risks that may be present in their workforce, as well as to 
ensure that the employees have the necessary physical fitness to perform their job duties.
2) 	 Training on Environment and Employee Health and safety:
	
This training is essential to ensure that employees are aware of the risks associated with working in a 
particular environment, and to ensure that they take the necessary precautions to keep themselves 
and their colleagues safe.

5) 	 Safety Committee: This committee will be responsible for ensuring compliance with safety 
regulations, conducting safety audits and inspections, and creating and implementing safety 
programs to reduce the risk of injury to workers.
6) 	 Emergency Preparedness/Mock Drill: This drill is designed to ensure that employees are familiar 
with emergency procedures, such as evacuation routes, in case of an emergency. It also tests the 
effectiveness of existing safety protocols and identifies any areas for improvement.
7)	 Near Miss Report and Incident Investigation System: This system is designed to identify and 
analyse potential and actual accidents and incidents in order to anticipate and prevent future 
incidents. It allows employees to report near misses or incidents and have them investigated so that 
the causes can be identified, and corrective measures taken to reduce the risk of similar incidents 
occurring in the future.
8) 	 Visitor Management system and Safety Guide: Such a system helps to identify who is on site, as 
well as to ensure that visitors are aware of the safety protocols in place and are following them. It 
also allows the Company to keep track of visitors and any potential hazards they may be exposed 
to and take the necessary steps to protect them.
9) 	 Safety Audits: Safety audits help to identify potential hazards and risks in the workplace, and to 
determine the necessary measures to prevent accidents, injuries, and illnesses. They also help to 
ensure that the necessary safety equipment and procedures are in place and are being followed.
2.
What are the processes used 
to identify work-related 
hazards and assess risks on 
a routine and non-routine 
basis by the entity?
The identification of work-related hazards and assessment of risks is a critical process to ensure the 
safety and well-being of employees in any organization. The specific processes used may vary depending 
on the industry, organization, and local regulations, but generally include the following steps:
The observance of work safety analysis, Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA), standard 
operating procedure, and operational control plan helps to monitor routine activities.
To ensure the health and safety of personnel, equipment, and materials involved, non-routine activities 
are supervised using a seven-type work permit system. The seven types of work permit cover various 
types of hazardous activities, including:
1)	 Hot work Operations
2)	 Cold work activities
3)	 Electrical installation and maintenance
4)	 Working at heights
5)	 Electromechanical services
6)	 Confined space entry
7)	 Heavy lifting operations
This system ensures that every non-routine activity is evaluated and planned, with appropriate safety 
measures in place before work can begin. By strictly adhering to this system, the Company can minimize 
the risks associated with non-routine activities, preventing accidents and injuries.
3.
Whether you have processes 
for workers to report the 
work-related hazards and 
to remove themselves from 
such risks. (Y/N)
Yes, to ensure a safe and healthy work environment, we are actively monitoring and addressing 
workplace hazards through a variety of forums. These forums allow us to gather feedback from workers 
and identify potential safety risks.
The forums that we use to monitor and gather input from workers include Safety Patrols, Workplace 
Inspections, Pictorial PPE Displays, Identification of Unsafe Conditions and Unsafe Acts, Safety Audits 
(including Gemba and Departmental Audits), Monthly Safety Audits, On-the-Job Training on Safety, 
Safety Committee Meetings, and Mock Drills and Emergency Preparedness Training.
Through these various forums, we are able to gather feedback and identify potential safety hazards. 
We then take proactive steps to address these hazards and ensure that our workers have the necessary 
knowledge and tools to work safely. This includes providing fire fighting and first aid training, as well as 
ongoing safety training to help workers identify and avoid potential safety risks.
Overall, our commitment to safety is a top priority, and we will continue to work to ensure that all of 
our workers are able to work in a safe and healthy environment.

12.	 Measures to ensure a safe and healthy workplace:
Describe the 
measures 
taken by 
the entity to 
ensure a safe 
and healthy 
workplace.
The Company emphasizes on the importance of maintaining a safe and healthy workplace for all its employees. The entity 
takes the health and safety of its employees as a top priority and has implemented various measures to ensure a safe and 
healthy work environment.
The Company has successfully implemented safety calendars incorporating RED/GREEN indicators to indicate the incidence of 
accidents within a specific month. This implementation is intended to visually illustrate the safety condition of each worksite 
and empower employees to actively track their advancement towards attaining a zero-accident objective. The utilization of 
RED/GREEN indicators facilitates a swift and unequivocal evaluation of accident frequency and the efficacy of safety endeavors.
The machines are equipped with sensors designed to mitigate the risk of danger. These sensors detect changes in the 
environment, such as sudden temperature or pressure drops, and alert the machine to shut down to prevent potential damage. 
This proactive measure ensures optimal machine performance while maintaining safety standards.
To adhere to safety protocols, flammable chemicals are stored separately within the warehouse to mitigate potential risks. 
Moreover, parameters have been established and implemented to ensure strict control over chemical release and keep them 
within permissible limits. These parameters require keeping chemicals away from ignition sources, strong air currents, and 
combustible materials and storing and handling them to meet specific safety requirements.
The Company implements various measures to improve the health and safety of its employees, including yearly planning 
to identify areas of improvement, regular inspection of the shop floor to assess machinery, equipment, tools, and working 
conditions, and awareness training on EHS. Incidents are investigated and reported to management, while unsafe conditions 
and acts are identified and evaluated for hazards and risk assessment. The Company also ensures a reliable firefighting system, 
forms first aid and firefighting committees, implements workplace safety programs, mandates the use of personal protective 
safety equipment (PPE), and conducts annual medical examinations to ensure employee health.

denote hazardous waste, green is designated for biodegradable waste, yellow is utilized for adhesive waste, and blue 
is assigned to plastic waste. This system aids in the convenient identification and segregation of different waste types, 
thereby facilitating effective disposal.
The safety of workers is crucial in waste management, as they are exposed to various hazards while handling waste. 
Hence the provision of safety Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is given to the workers who handle waste.
An authorized vendor has been identified for receiving scraps and waste. This ensures that the waste is collected and 
handled by a responsible and authorized vendor.
Waste disposal is routed through an approved vendor by KSPCB (Karnataka State Pollution Control Board)
Separate transportation facility for waste disposal purposes. This ensures that the waste is transported in a safe and 
organized manner and is disposed of in an environmentally responsible manner.
The Company identifies and monitors waste categories beyond the four-color-coded categories. These categories 
include E-waste, aluminium waste, roll storage waste, and metal scraps, and require specialized handling and disposal 
techniques.
