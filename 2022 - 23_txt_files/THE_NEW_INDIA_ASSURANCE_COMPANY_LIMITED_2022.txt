Data privacy 
and security
Risk
Data privacy and security are 
fundamental aspects of any 
modern business operation. By 
implementing robust measures 
and systems, organizations can 
safeguard information, prevent 
unauthorized 
access, 
and 
ensure that private data is used 
solely for its intended purposes. 
Prioritizing data privacy and 
security 
not 
only 
protects 
businesses from potential legal 
and 
financial 
repercussions 
but 
also 
fosters 
trust 
and 
confidence among customers 
and stakeholders.
Negative
Data privacy has become a 
matter of utmost importance 
for key stakeholders, including 
customers, 
regulators, 
and 
investors, within our company. 
Any potential risks or breaches 
in this area could result in 
substantial 
financial 
losses 
for both our valued customers 
and our business as a whole. 
Therefore, 
it 
is 
imperative 
that we prioritize and address 
data privacy concerns with the 
utmost diligence and care.

Risk 
Management
Risk
Enterprise Risk Management 
plays a pivotal role in ensuring 
the smooth functioning and 
success of an organization. 
By proactively identifying and 
addressing 
potential 
risks, 
including 
those 
related 
to 
ESG factors, companies can 
safeguard 
their 
operations 
and 
enhance 
their 
overall 
performance.
Negative
The board’s involvement in 
ERM ensures a comprehensive 
understanding 
of 
the 
organization’s risk landscape. 
Through their oversight, they 
can provide strategic guidance 
and make informed decisions 
to mitigate potential risks. This 
collaborative approach fosters 
a culture of risk awareness and 
accountability throughout the 
organization.
8
Climate 
change 
mitigation
Risk
Climate 
change-related 
risks 
necessitate 
the 
utilization 
and periodic evaluation of a 
comprehensive 
framework 
to ensure their effective and 
appropriate 
management. 
Implementing 
strategies 
to 
mitigate these risks leads to 
an augmented need for capital 
reserves to address the financial 
losses incurred in the event of 
such occurrences.
Negative
Implementing 
robust 
mechanisms 
to 
capture 
and factor in climate risks is 
crucial for the company to 
ensure 
appropriate 
pricing 
of its products. By effectively 
incorporating climate risks into 
our pricing strategies, we can 
enhance our understanding of 
the potential impacts on our 
business operations and make 
informed decisions.

Do you have a focal point (Individual/Committee)

(Yes/No)
Yes. 
The company has implemented a Whistleblower policy 
to encourage employees to report any issues they 
may encounter, without the fear of facing retaliation, 
discrimination, or disadvantages. To ensure a smooth 
reporting process, designated channels have been 
established, allowing employees to voice their concerns 
to the Audit Committee/Chief Risk Officer.
Furthermore, employees have the option to report their 
grievances to Grievance Redressal team at Regional 
levels and corporate office. Additionally, the company has 
appointed POSH Members who specialize in resolving 
issues related to discrimination and its effects.
To provide easy access to the Whistleblower policy, the 
company has made it available on their website. You can 
find the policy by following the link provided below:

policy, the company aims to create a safe and transparent

report any concerns they may have.
5.	
Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress 
grievances related to human rights issues
The Organisation has multiple policies and platforms 
to address the employee grievances related to human 
rights. These are as under:
Whistleblower (WB) Policy: Our organization has 
implemented a comprehensive WB policy that allows 
all employees the option and opportunity to raise any 
issues or grievances anonymously. We prioritize the 
confidentiality of the whistleblower’s identity.
Prevention of Harassment Guidelines (POSH): In our 
commitment to providing a safe and equal opportunity 
environment for all genders, we have implemented 
guidelines for the Prevention of Harassment (POSH). 
We regularly raise awareness about these guidelines to 
ensure that any instances of harassment are promptly 
addressed. Employees can reach out to the Internal 
Committee of our organization. Alternatively, they can 
also report the matter to our HR team. As prescribed by 
the POSH Act, an internal committee is formed for each 
reported instance to conduct a thorough investigation and 
take necessary action when required.
By enhancing our Whistle Blower policy and POSH 
guidelines, we aim to foster a professional and inclusive 
work environment where every employee feels secure 
and empowered.
Appellate Authority: In case the employee having 
grievance is not satisfied with the outcome of any of 
the investigation conducted or resolution provided, then 
one has the option of appealing against the same to the 
Appellate Authority of the Organisation.
