The Company is focused on creating and ensuring a healthy workplace, free from occupational hazards, to realize its aim of 
zero incidents. To achieve this vision, emphasis has been on making and implementing rules, training employees on preventive 
measures, and setting up fool-proofing measures on site. This is further complimented by the implementation of best-in-
class engineering standards for design and project execution. This has enabled the company to keep workplace hazards to a

Company had successfully merged the EMS and OHSAS requirements into a common management system called IMS. This 
has avoided unnecessary duplication of work in monitoring and maintenance of records. The facilities are also certified for ISO 
45001 on Occupational Health and Safety Management System by DQS.
