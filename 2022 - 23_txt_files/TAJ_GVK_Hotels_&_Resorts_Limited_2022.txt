underscores the company's dedication

Climate Change Risk
Climate change poses a signiﬁcant 
risk on hospitality sector. Changes 
in weather patterns can negatively 
impact tourism in certain regions, 
as extreme heat or drought may 
make them less attractive to visitors. 
Furthermore, the industry may also 
face additional costs to adapt to these 
changes, such as building sea walls or 
upgrading air conditioning systems. 
Our 
commercial 
activities 
incur 
signiﬁcant overhead expenditures, 
with energy being one of them.
We have systems to track and 
minimise power consumption in our 
hotels and also have tied up with the 
Green Power supply company at one 
of our Hotel.

10. Health and safety management system:
a. Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Yes/No). 
If yes, the coverage of such system?
 
Yes. The Company has rigorously implemented an occupational health and safety management system across all its 
hotel establishments to ensure the well being of its entire workforce.
 
TAJ GVK adheres to an integrated Health Safety & Environment (HSE) management framework, encompassing three 
key categories:
Annual Report - 2022-23 l 101
 
• Food Safety: The Company’s approach is grounded in compliance with HACCP and FASSIA guidelines, bolstered by 
the support of the external agency Diversey.
 
• Fire & Life Safety: The Company maintain stringent alignment with DNV-GL guidelines alongside IHCL's own 
safety directives, solidifying a comprehensive ﬁre and life safety protocol.
 
• Sustainability: The Company’s commitment to sustainability ﬁnds expression through adherence to Earth Check 
standards and its commitment in reﬂecting its dedication to environmentally conscious practices.
 
These integrated approaches collectively ensure a holistic occupational health and safety system that safeguards its 
employees and customers alike.
b. What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis 
by the entity?
 
The Company’s comprehensive approach involves the engagement of the Hotel Safety Committee, which conducts 
Safety Risk Assessments as a fundamental step. These assessments undergo regular reviews and serve as essential 
resources for eﬀective incident management within its hotels. Furthermore, the Company enhances its Hazard 
Identiﬁcation and Risk Assessment (HIRA) procedure by incorporating insights gleaned from the analysis of yellow 
cards, thus ensuring a well-rounded risk assessment process.
 
Based on the outcomes of these assessments, it implemented suitable controls, often employing administrative 
measures, to curtail potential risks. These controls play a pivotal role in minimizing the likelihood of hazards translating 
into actual incidents. Importantly, the established controls are intricately linked to the capital expenditure (Capex) and 
operational expenditure (Opex) requisites of its hotels, underscoring its steadfast commitment to upholding safety 
across all dimensions of its operations
c. Whether you have processes for workers to report the work related hazards and to remove themselves from such 
risks. (Yes/ No)
 
Yes
d. Do the employees/ worker of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services? (Yes/

Yes, all of the locations have access to non-work-related medical and healthcare services, either on-site or through 
partnerships with reputable healthcare providers nearby. Additionally, staﬀ members receive on-site medical 
emergency response training.

12. Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy work place:
i. Risk Assessment Framework: Our approach revolves around robust hazard identiﬁcation and risk assessment, 
meticulously executed in alignment with both the Hazard Identiﬁcation and Risk Assessment (HIRA) Procedure and 
the Job Safety Analysis (JSA) Procedure. These procedures lay the foundation for eﬀective risk management.
ii. Control Hierarchy Implementation: We strictly adhere to the hierarchy of controls when implementing risk mitigation 
strategies. Tailored Control Plans are meticulously devised, considering the level of risk associated with speciﬁc tasks. 
This rigorous process ensures that no task proceeds until risks are mitigated to an acceptable threshold.
102 l TAJ GVK Hotels & Resorts Limited
iii. Safety Committees: Our commitment to safety is reﬂected in the presence of dedicated Hotel Safety Committees at 
various organizational levels. These committees play a pivotal role in assessing the suﬃciency of safety resources and 
provide vital support for the seamless deployment of our safety management system.
iv. Ongoing Audits and Inspections: The assurance of a safe and healthy work environment is upheld through a 
regime of systematic safety audits and inspections conducted across our facilities. These periodic assessments not 
only evaluate the eﬃcacy of safety protocols but also serve as proactive mechanisms to identify and rectify potential 
hazards, reinforcing our commitment to maintaining a secure and conducive workplace for all.
13. Number of Complaints on the Working Conditions and Health and Safety made by employees and workers:
 
The Company has not received any complaint on "Health & Safety" and "Working Conditions" in FY2022-23 and

assess the eﬀectiveness of its safety practices and working conditions. If any deviations from the established standards 
are identiﬁed, prompt preventive and corrective actions are initiated to rectify the situation.
 
Furthermore, as part of the Company’s dedication to safety, it has developed a comprehensive Road and Driving 
Safety Manual, meticulously designed in accordance with the guidelines outlined in the Driving Safety Manual. This 
manual has been diligently shared with all transportation providers, including those responsible for employee and 
guest transport services. To ensure its eﬀectiveness, personnel associated with these transportation services undergo 
rigorous training to ensure they are well-versed in the guidelines and practices outlined in the manual.
 
Maintaining transparency and accountability is paramount for TAJ GVK. Thus, the Company meticulously monitors

7. Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases.
 
TAJ GVK is committed to upholding a workplace environment free from discrimination and harassment. The 
Company places great emphasis on safeguarding the rights and well-being of complainants. The Company’s approach 
includes the following mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences:
 
Protection Under POSH Policy: Our comprehensive Prevention of Sexual Harassment (POSH) policy explicitly 
prohibits any form of retaliation against individuals who report instances of sexual harassment. This policy extends 
protection not only to the complainant but also to witnesses and those involved in the investigation process.
 
Immediate Reporting: Any employee who suspects or experiences retaliation is encouraged to promptly report the 
incident to the designated authorities. We take such reports seriously and handle them with the same diligence as 
alleged cases of discrimination or harassment.
 
Thorough Investigation: Retaliation cases are treated as seriously as any other case of discrimination or harassment. 
Our investigation process is unbiased, thorough, and transparent, ensuring that complainants are heard, and the truth 
is unveiled.
 
Educational Initiatives: We believe in proactive prevention. Regular training programs and workshops are conducted 
to educate employees about their rights, responsibilities, and the consequences of retaliation. This empowers 
individuals to recognize, report, and prevent retaliation eﬀectively.
 
Conﬁdentiality: We understand the sensitivities involved in such cases. Conﬁdentiality is maintained to the extent 
possible, preserving the privacy of complainants and witnesses while ensuring a fair investigation.
 
We stand ﬁrmly behind our commitment to fostering a respectful and inclusive workplace. Through these mechanisms, 
we aim to create an environment where individuals feel safe, conﬁdent, and empowered to raise concerns without 
fearing adverse consequences

7. Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If yes, then provide details.
 
Yes, TAJ GVK has undertaken several projects focused on reducing Green House Gas (GHG) emissions. Here are the 
details of these initiatives:
 
• Replacement of AHU (Air Handling Unit): By replacing older and less energy-eﬃcient AHUs with newer models, 
TAJ GVK optimized its air circulation and ventilation systems, leading to reduced energy consumption and lower 
GHG emissions.
 
• Replacement of Lights with installation of LED: The entity has opted to replace traditional lighting ﬁxtures with 
energy-eﬃcient LED lights. As LED lights consume less electricity, it results in a decreased electricity consumption.
 
• HSD replaced with LPG in boiler: TAJ GVK has implemented the substitution of High-Speed Diesel (HSD) with 
Liqueﬁed Petroleum Gas (LPG) as the fuel source for their boilers. This transition to LPG helps in lowering GHG 
emissions, as LPG combustion emits fewer greenhouse gases.
 
• Conversion of LPG to PNG: The Company has undertaken the conversion of LPG (Liqueﬁed Petroleum Gas) to PNG 
(Piped Natural Gas). This switch to cleaner and more sustainable natural gas.
 
• Installation of endocube sensors for refrigeration units: TAJ GVK has installed endocube sensors in their refrigeration 
units. These sensors optimize and regulate cooling processes, resulting in reduced energy consumption and 
subsequently lower GHG emissions.
 
• Replacement of energy-eﬃcient VFD Chiller: The entity has opted for an energy-eﬃcient Variable Frequency Drive 
(VFD) Chiller. VFD chillers provide better control over the cooling process, leading to energy savings and a reduction 
in GHG emissions.
 
• Cooling tower ﬁns along with service: TAJ GVK has focused on maintaining and servicing the cooling tower ﬁns. 
Properly functioning cooling tower ﬁns enhance the cooling eﬃciency, helping to minimize energy usage and GHG 
emissions.
 
Through these projects, TAJ GVK demonstrates its commitment to environmental sustainability and actively 
contributes to the global eﬀort to combat climate change by reducing Green House Gas emissions in its operations

standards. In addition to this proactive measure, we conduct regular internal and external audits of our environmental 
management systems. These audits assess not only our internal practices but also extend to evaluating the compliance 
of our partners within the value chain.
 
This approach ensures the continuous observance of responsible environmental practices and standards, bolstering not 
only our company's eﬀorts but also those of our valued partners across the entire value chain.
