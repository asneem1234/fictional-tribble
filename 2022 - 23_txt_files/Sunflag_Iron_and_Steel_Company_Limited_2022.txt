The objective of this Management Discussion is to present an analysis of the current Indian and World economic scenario along with the 
expectations from the period ahead.
GLOBAL ECONOMIC SCENARIO & OUTLOOK
A) MACRO-ECONOMIC CONDITIONS
 
After growing 3.1 percent last year, the global economy is set to slow substantially in 2023, to 2.1 percent, amid continued monetary 
policy tightening to rein in high inflation, before a tepid recovery in 2024, to 2.4 percent. Tight global financial conditions and subdued 
external demand are expected to weigh on growth across emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs). Projections for many 
countries have been revised down over the forecast horizon, with upgrades primarily due to stronger-than-expected data at the 
beginning of 2023 more than offset by downgrades thereafter. Inflation has been persistent but is projected to decline gradually as 
demand weakens and commodity prices moderate, provided longer-term inflation expectations remain anchored. Global growth could 
be weaker than anticipated in the event of more widespread banking sector stress or if more persistent inflation pressures prompt 
tighter-than-expected monetary policy. Recent bank failures call for a renewed focus on global financial regulatory reform. Global 
cooperation is also necessary to accelerate the clean energy transition, mitigate climate change and provide debt relief for the rising 
number of countries experiencing debt distress. At the national level, it is imperative to implement credible policies to contain inflation 
and ensure macroeconomic and financial stability, as well as undertake reforms to set the foundations for a robust, sustainable, and 
inclusive development path.
 
In all, greater-than-expected resilience of major economies at the end of 2022 and early in 2023 led to the overall upgrade to growth in 
2023. Growth rate in 2023 in USA is expected to be 1.6%, while the eurozone is expected to remain strained at 0.8%. The energy shock, 
a result of the war in Ukraine, continues to impact the economic activity in Europe. China's economy is set to rebound to 5.2% as mobility 
and industrial activity pick up after lifting of pandemic restrictions.
B) RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND ECONOMIC OUTLOOK
 
Advanced economies
 
Tight labor markets and high wage growth prevented a sharper slowdown in advanced economies in early 2023. Policy rate hikes and 
recent bank failures have contributed to a tightening of financial conditions and a slowdown in bank lending. The recovery in China is 
expected to be led by services activity, which tends to be less trade intensive. In the first quarter of 2023, GDP expanded by 1.1 percent in 
the United States on a quarterly basis, supported by broadly robust consumption. EURO area GDP grew by 0.3 percent at an annualized 
rate, reflecting lower energy prices, easing supply bottlenecks, and fiscal policy support for firms and households. Advanced-economy 
growth is projected to slow to an annual average of 0.7 percent in 2023. This largely reflects the continued effect of considerable central 
bank policy rate hikes since early 2022. More restrictive credit conditions due to banking sector stress in advanced economies should 
slow domestic demand further in 2023. Past increases in energy prices and the expected softening in labor markets are also projected to 
weigh on activity. Growth is expected to accelerate modestly to 1.2 percent in 2024 due to a pickup in the euro area.
35
 
Emerging Market and Developing Economies (EMDE) outlook
 
Growth in EMDEs is projected to edge up to 4 percent in 2023, which almost entirely reflects the rebound in China. Excluding China, 
EMDE growth is set to decline to 2.9 percent this year, from 4.1 percent last year, due to the drag from high inflation and the 
associated monetary tightening—both domestically and via monetary policy spillovers from advanced economies—as well as from 
slowing external demand. Growth in EMDEs excluding China is expected to pick up modestly to 3.4 percent in 2024, as the effects 
of monetary tightening diminish and several larger EMDEs emerge from domestic strains, including natural disasters, power 
shortages, and political turbulence.
C)  INDIAN ECONOMY
 
Strong economic growth in the first quarter of FY 2022-23 helped India overcome the UK to become the fifth-largest economy after it 
recovered from repeated waves of COVID-19 pandemic shock. 
 
India has emerged as the fastest-growing major economy in the world and is expected to be one of the top three economic powers 
in the world over the next 10-15 years, backed by its robust democracy and strong partnerships.With more than 100 unicorns 
valued at US$ 332.7 billion, India has the third-largest unicorn base in the world. The government is also focusing on renewable 
sources to generate energy and is planning to achieve 40% of its energy from non-fossil sources by 2030.
 
According to the McKinsey Global Institute, India needs to boost its rate of employment growth and create 90 million non-farm jobs 
between 2023 and 2030 in order to increase productivity and economic growth. The net employment rate needs to grow by 1.5% 
per annum from 2023 to 2030 to achieve 8-8.5% GDP growth between 2023 and 2030. India's current account deficit (CAD), 
primarily driven by an increase in the trade deficit, stood at 2.1% of GDP in the first quarter of FY 2022-23. 
D) ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS OUTLOOK- GLOBAL AND INDIAN STEEL INDUSTRY
 
1. GLOBAL AND INDIAN STEEL INDUSTRY
 
The global steel production volume is estimated to reach 2175 million tonnes in 2024, growing at a CAGR of 4.50% for the period 
spanning from 2020 to 2024. The factors such as rising population growth, growing urban population, growing automobile sector, 
growing spending on construction and infrastructure projects and growing demand for long steel are expected to drive the market. 
However, the growth of the industry will be challenged by price volatility. A few notable trends include technological advancements, 
rising demand for stainless steel and rising demand for recycled steel.
 
The global steel market is expected to grow in future owing to increasing infrastructural activities and rising adoption of steel in 
automotive, electrical and other end-use industries. In terms of geographical areas, China is the major contributors to the global 
steel production supported by increasing automotive production and growth of electrical appliances. India is the fastest-growing 
market for steel with increasing urbanization, industrialization and infrastructure investments.
 
As per reports by CareEdge Research, the domestic steel consumption growth rate in India is expected to be around 10-12% in 
FY2023. There is also a rise in investments in the infrastructure sector and support from the government to encourage the growth 
and outlook of the Indian steel industry.
 
One of the primary forces behind industrialization has been the use of metals. Steel has traditionally occupied a top spot among 
metals. Steel production and consumption are frequently seen as measures of a country's economic development because it is 
both a raw material and an intermediary product. Therefore, it would not be an exaggeration to argue that the steel sector has 
always been at the forefront of industrial progress and that it is the foundation of any economy. 
 
India emerged as the second largest steel producer in the world. India's finished steel production has increased by over 6%, 
whereas globally steel production declined by 4.2% in calendar year 2022. India's Steel consumption has grown over 11% to 119 
million tonnes in FY 2023 from 105 million tonnes in FY 2022. Steel consumption including exports will be around 132 million tonnes 
to 135 million tonnes in FY 2024. 
 
The growth in the Indian steel sector has been driven by the domestic availability of raw materials such as iron ore and cost-effective 
labour. Consequently, the steel sector has been a major contributor to India's manufacturing output. The Indian steel industry is 
modern, with state-of-the-art steel mills. It has always strived for continuous modernisation of older plants and up-gradation to 
higher energy efficiency levels.
 
Overall, the key steel consuming sectors are expected to perform well in FY2023-24 supported by a rise in infrastructure spend by 
the Government and gradually improving semiconductor supply. High CAPEX allocation in key steel consuming sectors such as 
railways, national highways and housing is expected to drive steel consumption.
 
2. OUTLOOK FOR STEEL INDUSTRY- OPPORTUNITIES AND THREATS
 
The steel industry has emerged as a major focus area given the dependence of a diverse range of sectors on its output as India 
works to become a manufacturing powerhouse through policy initiatives like Make in India. With the industry accounting for about 
2% of the nation's GDP, India ranks as the world's second-largest producer of steel and is poised to overtake China as the world's 
second-largest consumer of steel. Both the industry and the nation's export manufacturing capacity have the potential to help India 
regain its favourable steel trade balance.
 
The National Steel Policy, 2017 envisage 300 million tonnes of production capacity by 2030-31. The per capita consumption of steel 
has increased from 57.6 kgs to 74.1 kgs during the last five years. The government has a fixed objective of increasing rural 
consumption of steel from the current 19.6 kg/per capita to 38 kg/per capita by 2030-31. 
36
 
Huge scope for growth is offered by India's comparatively low per capita steel consumption and the expected rise in consumption due to 
increased infrastructure construction and the thriving automobile and railways sectors.
 
According to the Indian Steel Association (ISA), domestic steel demand stood at 119.86 mt in fiscal 2022-23. Indian steel demand is 
expected to be robust and growing by 6.2% in FY2023-24 supported by strong GDP growth forecast, private consumption and 
Government expenditure. India's capital goods sector is also expected to benefit from the momentum in infrastructure and investment in 
renewable energy. Automotive and consumer durables are expected to maintain healthy growth driven by sustained growth in private 
consumption.
 
Integrated Steel Players will continue to add capacity in FY2023-24, and utilisation levels are expected to remain healthy at 80%. Net 
export position is expected to strengthen with removal of export duty.
 
In order to unleash the demand-led growth of steel industry in India, the government is pushing through extensive reforms to strengthen 
infrastructure to enhance productivity. It would be intriguing to see how effectively India implements its reform agenda and infrastructure 
plans to pave the way for optimal growth and expansion of the steel industry.
 
In parallel with this, there are certain international trends such as the looming trade wars and economic slowdown which are going to 
test the mettle of Indian steel industry. 
 
It is worth noting here that the cost of steel production in India is higher compared to other countries because of creaking infrastructure, 
high taxes and expensive cost of capital. 
 
OPPORTUNITIES
 
’s Super Alloy Steel manufacturing facility has been commissioned and now it shall be able cater to requirements 
 
related to Aircraft Parts, Defence, Space Vehicle, Nuclear Reactor, Super-critical Power Plants, Industrial and Vehicle Gas Turbines, 
Petro-Chemical Plants and other High Temp and Corrosive Applications. This will enable the Company to reduce its dependency on 
automotive and auto ancillary industries and create opportunity for expansion and foray in new markets.
 
 is an approved vendor to VSSC, LPSC, HAL and GE Gas & Power and has received orders for supply of high-quality 
 
Aero steels & Inconel's.
 
Steel is a key sector for the Indian economy. India is the world's second largest producer of crude steel and second largest consumer of 
finished steel. In FY 21-22, the sector contributed approximately 2% to the country's GDP and provided approximately 20 lakh jobs. 
Moreover, the sector is set for significant growth: the National Steel Policy has set a target to reach 300 million tonnes (MT) of annual 
production by 2030 from the existing level of 120 MT.
 
The Steel Ministry has signed 57 MoUs with 27 Companies for speciality steel under PLI scheme. The PLI scheme, which is expected to 
generate an investment of about `30,000 crores and create additional capacity of about 25 million tonnes of speciality steel in the next 
five years.
 
Steel Ministry is in the process of aligning policies with the Gati Shakti Master Plan, which will complement the hundred lakh crore 
investments for infrastructure development. Increased indigenous defence procurement and a growing manufacturing sector in the 
country is expected to contribute to steel demand.
 
CURRENT CHALLENGES / THREATS
 
Susceptibility to fluctuations in raw material prices, changes in government regulations, and cyclicality in the steel and domestic auto 
industry:
 
Profitability is susceptible to fluctuations in raw material prices. Raw material costs constitute 60-65% of the revenue; although there is a 
pass-through mechanism to counter fluctuations, it happens with a time lag. The inability to pass on price hikes to customers 
immediately also constrains profitability. Operating margin has been volatile at 12-15% during the five fiscals through 2022-23 due to 
fluctuations in raw material prices.
 
Vulnerability to adverse changes in duties and tariffs also increases the final output cost, thereby reducing the competitiveness of 
products in domestic and global markets. Any unfavourable changes in import regulations intensifies competition from manufacturers in 
China and other countries, thereby restricting the pricing power. 
 
Sunflag operates in the cyclical steel industry, thus making it vulnerable to downturns in demand, leading to a decline in realisations. 
Moreover, the bulk of revenue is derived from the domestic automobile industry, primarily the passenger car and commercial vehicle 
segments. In the automotive industry, demand depends on economic growth and consumer sentiments. Any decline in demand could 
impinge on sales and profitability. 
 
SUSTAINABILITY
 
 is committed to maintain its quality and has received appreciations and awards from various sources. With the 
 
continuous efforts on making clean steel, now Company is focusing on expanding its market share in other segments viz. railways and 
defence etc. This will protect the Company from dependency on Automobile sector.
 
 exploring better opportunities in the years to come due to continuous developments of new grades of high alloy steel 
 
as well as wire rod. Further, venturing into the self-dependency of raw materials will help in reduction in the cost of production and 
enhancing the profitability. This has even proved advantageous during the recessionary period which is a very good sign for the 
Company.
37
38
 
MATERIAL DEVELOPMENT
 
During the year under review, 
 has signed MoUs for four product categories with the Ministry of Steel under the 
 
Production-linked incentive (PLI) Scheme- 2013 for specialty steel.
 
The Company during the year commissioned its Blooming mill and Forging Plant which are now operating at their minimum capacity in 
view of operational requirement for stabilization. Few approvals from customers for super alloy products have been received and 
accordingly the Company is now developing various grades of steel to cater to these customers.
 
During the year under review, 
 see some material change in the top line and in profitability. Indian Steel industry has 
 
been driven by availability of raw material viz. iron ore, coal, coking coal etc. and cost of labour. Consequently, the financial year under 
review remained volatile during the year. Further, your Company with continuous development of new grades of steel and upgradation 
of plant and equipment, could maintain its presence in the market particularly in automobile industry. As a result, there was an increase 
in the sales and profit before tax. Profit before exceptional items and taxes stood at `291.10 crore in the year under review as against 
`284.29 crore in the previous year.
 
In order to achieve effective cost reduction and improvement in productivity, activity of Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) continued 
to be implemented by the Company during the Financial Year 2022-23 under review.

Solid Waste generation and management 
Fly Ash (CPP) : Generation of fly ash is basically from AFBC Boiler. Fly ash is removed from fluidized bed of the steam generator and 
hoppers of the steam generator bank, economizer, air pre-heater and ESP. In the existing setup, generation of fly ash is 26784 TPA.
Fly ash, collected is conveyed pneumatically through pipeline to fly ash silo. Electronic controls are installed to ensure leak proof transfer of 
fly ash from hoppers to fly ash silo. Bag house filter is also installed at fly ash silo to arrest fugitive emissions.
Fly ash is sent to cement plants and balance is used for in-house brick manufacturing. Care is taken to avoid any dust emission.  
Bed Ash (CPP) : Bed ash is generated from AFBC steam generator. The total quantity of bed ash generation is about 22320 TPA.
Quenching of the bed ash is carried out by spraying the cooling tower blow down water. Bed Ash is used for internal road and filling low lying 
areas in plant premises. 
ESP Dust & DRI Ash : ESP Dust & DRI Ash are generated at DRI Plant and used as fuel in the existing plant. DRI sludge is also used as fuel 
in FBC Boiler and also disposed by sale to local parties. DRI sludge will be generated from the scrubber installed at the DRI Plant. This 
sludge will be basically DRI Ash having good calorific value. 
The water treatment plant and effluent recycle plant provided in close loop of CCM, BSM & ASM has sludge drying beds for solar drying of 
solids separated at sludge drying beds. This is used in sinter plant for sinter manufacture.
In the existing setup, generation of ESP Dust & DRI Ash is 148400 TPA.
Bag Filter Dusts (DRI & SMS) : Dusts are collected from the bag filters installed in various sections mainly raw material handling in DRI and 
SMS/AOD. The quantity of bag filters dusts at full production capacity is 36750 TPA.
Dust collected at the bag filters of raw material handling sections of direct reduced iron plant is partly reused in the process of manufacturing 
sponge iron and balance for utilization in sinter plant for manufacturing sinter. The dust collected from the bag filters provided to EAF and 
LHF of the steel melting shop is 15750 TPA and is used in the sinter plant for manufacturing sinter. The dust collection from the bag filter 
provided to Stainless Steel Refining Converter of the steel melting shop is also used in the sinter plant for manufacturing sinter.
IF & EAF Slag : In existing setup, slag is generated from EAF. Total quantity of slag generation, at full production capacity is about 100200 
TPA and it is disposed by landfill within factory area. Slag is generated from Stainless Steel Refining Converter also and is used in the sinter 
plant for manufacturing sinter. 
After proposed expansion, slag will be generated from IF & EAF. Total quantity of slag generation, at full production capacity will be about 
195629 TPA. It will be disposed through sale to cement manufacturers and for roads construction and other end users. Slag will be 
generated from Stainless Steel Refining Converter also and it will be used same as in existing set up. 
Mill Scale (CCM & Rolling Mill) : Mill scale is generated at CCM, BSM and ASM Sections. The quantity of mill scale generated at full 
production capacity is about 10500 TPA. Water used for cooling purposes of billets and rolled steel products, carries mill scale along with it 
and admitted in scale pit under gravity. From the scale pit, mill scale is removed periodically. The total mill scale constitutes 2/3rd from CCM 
60
mill scale and about 1/3rd from BSM/ASM Mill Scale. These scales are used for sinter manufacture.
Iron/Steel Scrap/Rejected Billets (Rolling Mill) : Total generation of Iron/Steel Scrap/Rejected Billets from existing plant at full production 
capacity is 20000 TPA.
Iron/Steel Scrap 15000 TPA is generated during cutting of steel bars at BSM, ASM of Rolling Mill. Steel Scrap is also generated from Bright 
Bar Section and Coiler. Rejected Billets 5000 TPA from Rolling Mill are also generated at full production capacity. These solid wastes are 
recycled by melting in the steel manufacturing.
Grinder Waste (Rolling Mill) : It is generated during removal of upper layer of steel bars at Bright Bar Section. Total quantity of grinder 
waste generation is about 5000 TPA. This waste is recycled to SMS section for melting and reuse.
Coal Rejects/Fines (Coal Washery) : This waste is generated in the process of screening of crushed and wet coal at Coal Washery. The 
stone and shells of the coal are separated at screening. It is estimated 84000 TPA at full production capacity and are reused as fuel in power 
plant within the premises.
Granulated MBF Slag : Granulated MBF slag is taken from the bottom of MBF. The generation of MBF slag is 112500 TPA at full production 
capacity. This slag is partly used for making concrete roads within factory premises and balance is disposed by sale to cement plants.
Residue at MBF Gas Cleaning Plant: It is separated in thickner of Gas Cleaning Plant at MBF. The generation is 20000 TPA at full 
production capacity. This residue is used for sinter manufacture.
Coke Fines & Nuts (MBF Plant) : Coke fines are generated at MBF. The generation is 17500 TPA at full production capacity. Coke Fines are 
used in the sinter plant for manufacturing sinter.
Iron Ore Fines & Sinter (DRI & MBF Plant) : Iron Ore fines and Sinter are generated at DRI Plant & MBF. Total generation is 132900 TPA at 
full production capacity. Iron Ore Fines generation at DRI Plant is 27900 TPA and at MBF Iron Ore Fines and Sinter generation is 10500 TPA 
at full production capacity. Iron Ore Fines are used in the sinter plant for manufacturing sinter. 
Hot Returned Ore (Sinter Plant) : Hot returned ore is generated in Sinter plant 85000 TPA at full production capacity. Hot returned Ore is 
recycled in sinter plant.
Removed dust (Sinter Plant) : Removed dust is generated in Sinter plant 12500 TPA at full production capacity. Removed dust is recycled 
in sinter plant.
All stock piles and waste are and will be laid on top of a stable liner to avoid leaching of materials to ground water. Some plants of 
Brassicaceae family will be planted near raw material storage yard, ash disposal site as well as around the project area as a precautionary 
measure of phytoremediation.
4.7.2 
Hazardous Waste
Used/Spent Oil (Schedule–1, Category No. 5.1): Lubrication and other oils used in machineries loose their properties after use for some 
days. Used oils removed from machineries, gear boxes, compressors etc are collected in drums and the well-packed drums are temporarily 
stored in specifically earmarked area within the premises. 
These oils will be used in furnaces/Boilers and also for anti-rust coating of rolled steel products and also sold to authorized reprocessors 
/recyclers. 
Acid Residue, Spent Bath Sludge and ETP Chemical Sludge (Category No. 12.1, 12.2 & 35.3): Spent acid, acid residue and spent bath 
sludge generated at Bright Bar Section and Coinage Plant is transported to CETP (Common Effluent Treatment Plant) for treatment. 
Similarly spent acid, acid residue, spent bath sludge and rinsing water generated at Centralized Pickling Plant is drained to CETP for the 
treatment.
In CETP, neutralization is carried out and after flocculation, suspended solids are separated out at clarifier & gravity sand filters. Suspended 
solids in the form of dried sludge separated at gravity sand filters is termed as CETP Chemical Sludge.
At CPP, regeneration of DM Plant is carried out periodically using acid and sodium hydroxide. Effluent of DM Plant is very small and after 
neutralization in underground pit, the overflow of the pit is mixed with other treated effluents for disposal. Underground Pit of the DM Plant 
section is cleaned once in six months and solids are solar dried at CETP. These solids are termed as CETP chemical Sludge.
