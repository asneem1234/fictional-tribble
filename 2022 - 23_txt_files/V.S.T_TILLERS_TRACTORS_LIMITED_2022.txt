1.
Energy 
Management
R
Energy is an essential component 
in the production of industrial 
machinery. The majority of energy 
expenses in this sector come from 
acquired electricity, with purchased 
fuels coming in second. The specific 
energy sources, the extent of 
consumption, and the approaches 
to energy management are all 
influenced by the products being 
manufactured. The combination of 
energy sources a company utilizes, 
such as on-site generated electricity, 
grid-provided power, and alternative 
energy options, can significantly 
impact the cost and dependability 
of the energy supply. This, in 
turn, can affect the company's 
cost framework and exposure to 
regulatory risks.
To achieve environmental 
excellence, all Business units have 
persisted in their efforts to enhance 
energy usage efficiencies and 
elevate the proportion of renewable 
energy.
The company has implemented 
several measures to conserve 
energy and adopt alternative energy 
sources, which are outlined below:
Conducting an Energy Audit of the 
entire plant.
Replacing conventional street lights 
with LED street lights.
Installing a Power Factor Panel to 
monitor efficiency.
The Company has installed solar 
power in all the three plants, i.e., 
Hosur, Malur and Mysore
Negative
2.
Emission 
management
R
Numerous products in the Industrial 
Machinery & Goods sector rely on 
fossil fuels, consequently emitting 
greenhouse gases (GHGs) and other 
air pollutants during operation. The 
combination of customers seeking 
better fuel efficiency and regulations 
targeting emissions has led to a 
growing demand for energy-efficient 
and low-emission products in this 
field. Consequently, businesses 
that focus on creating products 
with these features might have an 
advantage in capturing a larger 
market share, minimizing regulatory 
risks, and enhancing their brand's 
value.
At VST, we take our corporate 
responsibilities seriously, proactively 
implementing energy management 
measures, and striving to decrease 
our corporate greenhouse gas 
emissions.
VST's greenhouse gas emissions 
mainly include direct emissions from 
the combustion of diesel in DG sets 
and Tractors, and indirect emissions 
from purchased electricity.
In addition, we plan to continue to 
reduce waste emissions.
Our objective is to accelerate the 
adoption of green technology and 
offer eco-friendly, energy-efficient 
products to the industry, with the 
aim of conserving resources and 
minimizing emissions.

3.
Waste 
Management
R
Waste reduction leads to multiple 
benefits. It reduces GHG emissions 
that contribute to climate change, 
saves the amount of waste that 
needs to be recycled, incinerated, or 
sent to landfills, cuts down energy 
costs, and the requirement of 
natural resources for making new 
products.
Our facilities have implemented 
waste management programs 
that offer instructions on how to 
conform to waste management 
regulations while also increasing 
recycling efforts. After segregating 
waste and recyclables, our facilities 
partner with authorized suppliers 
to ensure appropriate recycling 
or reuse. Our future efforts 
will prioritize minimizing waste 
generation in our operations, rather 
than just focusing on disposal 
methods. We are fully committed to 
reducing waste intensity resulting 
from our operations.
We are encouraging some packaging 
boxes to be reclaimed and reused.
Negative
4.
Water and 
waste water 
management
R
Water conservation is important 
to combat business risks as well 
as societal risks. Even a slight 
imbalance between the demand 
and supply of water can disturb the 
environment, social and financial 
ecosystems. It is crucial that a 
company maintains a balance 
for operations as well as for the 
community that uses it for various 
purposes.
Water is an indispensable element 
of our manufacturing operations, 
and our primary concern is areas 
that are at risk of water scarcity. 
We prioritize minimizing the 
consumption of fresh water in our 
operations by optimizing water 
usage, incorporating touch sensors, 
increasing employee awareness, and 
promoting water reuse. Rainwater is 
collected and used to recharge the 
ground water table. 2.5 Lakh litres of 
water is collected and reused. Our 
manufacturing facilities at Hosur 
and Malur maintain a zero-discharge 
policy for wastewater, which ensures 
that the water utilized for operations 
is reused within the facility or 
operation. The Processing water is 
sent to ETP plant. The wastewater 
is treated and further sent to plant 
for reuse. The sludge generated in 
the ETP plant are managed with the 
help of third-party vendor. The ETP 
sludge is sent to cement plant for 
energy recovery.
The waste water generated in office 
and canteens are sent to STP plant. 
The Recycled Water is used for 
gardening purposes. The sludge 
generated in STP plant is used as 
fertiliser for the plants.
Parameters of wastewater released 
are continuously monitored at the 
plants.

Material 
Sourcing and 
Efficiency
R
Companies in the industrial 
machinery sector face supply chain 
risks when they rely on essential 
materials for their products. 
These critical materials, often with 
limited or no viable substitutes, are 
frequently obtained from deposits 
located in a handful of countries 
with geopolitical instability. 
Additionally, growing global demand 
for these materials across various 
sectors heightens competition, 
leading to potential price surges and 
supply uncertainties. By reducing 
dependence on critical materials 
through alternative options and 
securing their supply, companies 
can minimize the likelihood of 
financial consequences resulting 
from supply disruptions and 
fluctuating input costs.
The company has implemented 
a Supplier Risk Management and 
Mitigation(SRMM) process to 
reduce Supply chain vulnerabilities. 
The Company utilizes multiple 
engagement tools with suppliers, 
including the integration of the 
Theory of Constraints(TOC) with 
other software systems. This 
ensures seamless information 
dissemination to all involved parties 
and offers comprehensive visibility 
through the supply chain. For 
enhancing capacity of suppliers, the 
company runs supplier development 
programs. These strategies are 
designed to boost transparency and 
elevate our operational efficiency.
Negative
6.
Operational 
health & 
safety
O
Safety, health and well-being 
serve as the foundation of the 
employee experience. Creating 
outstanding products and services 
for farmers starts with creating 
a work environment where the 
employees can grow and thrive. A 
positive working environment will 
enable to achieve winning outcomes 
for farmers, each other, and the 
shareholders.
The company maintain a separate 
notice board which specifies specific 
gears to be used during particular 
work. Non-occupational health 
services are provided to employees 
like - eye-checkup, blood test.
Positive

Employee 
satisfaction 
and well-
being
O
Employees’ capabilities and well-
being as the critical method to 
achieving organisational goals. It 
strives to create an inclusive culture 
that is open to all and promotes 
diversity. Driving an awareness of 
these considerations throughout 
the operations, setting high 
standards for employees’ protection, 
and educating and empowering 
managers and employees to take 
actions are needed to reduce risks.
Employee survey are conducted 
to understand the issues faced by 
employees.
Positive
8.
Customer 
Satisfaction
O
By focussing on customer centricity, 
delivering accessible technology, 
innovation and enhancing people 
capabilities, the company can 
continue to drive growth in the 
domestic market while pursuing 
global expansion. Effective customer 
engagement can help to understand 
business challenges, determine 
capabilities required to meet 
demand, and help to understand 
client's data privacy and security 
requirements.
In response to emerging product 
demands, the Company is actively 
involved in several stages of 
research, development, production, 
and marketing of eco-friendly 
automotive products. We are 
well-prepared to capitalize on 
opportunities with our efforts 
in innovative products and a 
comprehensive product portfolio.

Product 
Stewardship 
and 
Innovation
O
Industrial machinery and goods 
production involves significant 
usage of materials such as 
steel, iron, aluminium, glass, 
and plastics. By innovatively 
remanufacturing industrial 
machinery systems, companies 
in the sector can decrease the 
need for raw materials, as well as 
the time and resources necessary 
to create finished products. This 
approach also generates value 
from items that would otherwise 
be discarded or recycled. The 
advanced machineries, which 
are technologically enabled and 
improve the ‘more output per acre’ 
are finding acceptance among the 
farmer community. Consequently, 
innovative remanufacturing 
processes and designs can help 
reduce raw material demand, 
lower manufacturing expenses, 
and establish new sales avenues. 
This will further help in market 
penetration and increased market 
share.
Throughout the entire product 
technology development and 
design process, we adhere to our 
Product Safety regulations. These 
regulations mandate that a design 
must not pose an unreasonable risk 
of harm to the product user or those 
in close proximity. In enforcing this 
regulation, we take into account 
the individuals, environmental 
circumstances, and other products 
that the product is likely to 
encounter.
Positive
10.
Community 
Engagement
O
One of the key reasons for the 
success of a company is the 
continuous support of the people 
within immediate operating 
presence, who are influenced by the 
environmental and social impact 
of operations and CSR activities. 
By incorporating sustainable 
development into business, the 
company can strive to make a 
difference in the community its 
serve.
Being a farmer-focused, purpose-
driven organization, we deeply 
appreciate the importance of 
community and strive to find 
avenues to contribute to the 
numerous communities in which we 
function. We have taken proactive 
steps to participate in philanthropic 
initiatives aimed at enhancing the 
well-being of our neighbouring 
communities. We frequently 
collaborate with our dealer and 
distributor network to assist 
communities.
Positive
11.
Business 
Ethics and 
Compliance
R
Strong corporate governance is 
core to achieving the organization’s 
mission and any risks can 
undermine stakeholder trust, 
damage reputation and disrupt 
business.
VST is fully committed to 
maintaining the highest levels 
of ethical conduct. We actively 
encourage our employees to report 
any concerns or possible violations 
of the Code of Conduct, policies, 
or laws, without fear of retaliation. 
Upholding the highest standards 
of business ethics requires 
constant vigilance. VST's corporate 
governance framework aids in 
ensuring consistent adherence to 
ever-changing laws and regulations 
in a dynamic business environment.

Human Rights 
Management
R
Human Rights violations can 
include issues such as child labour, 
forced labour, discrimination, and 
unfair working conditions. Failure 
to address these risks can result 
in legal action, as well as negative 
publicity and damage to the 
company's reputation.
The Company continues to work 
towards strengthening and 
introducing systems to ensure 
sound implementation of VST’s 
Sustainability Policies specially with 
respect to human rights and labour 
practices.
The said Policies and their 
implementation are directed 
towards adherence to applicable 
laws and upholding the spirit of 
human rights. It is the responsibility 
of employees to maintain the 
standards of honour and integrity 
outlined in the Code of Business 
Conduct. All employees must review 
the code and integrate it into their 
work and conduct.
Negative
13.
Climate 
Change and 
Impact
O
The reduction of greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions that contribute 
to climate change necessitates the 
commitment to invest, innovate, 
and develop novel solutions. This 
involves designing machinery and 
equipment with lower tailpipe 
emissions and utilizing biofuels and 
sustainable fuels.
We view the worldwide shift to a 
low-carbon economy as a significant 
strategic opportunity for both 
our business and our customers. 
As technology advances, we are 
simultaneously embracing it to 
enhance the development of our 
products. In the past year, we 
successfully launched the 9 HP 
Power Tiller with electric start. Our 
goal is to tackle the challenges 
faced by farmers by leveraging 
electrification and reducing 
emissions.
We have also planted ~293 trees at 
Malur plant site to create positive 
environmental impact and ~770 
plants in Hosur location.

Corporate 
Governance
R
Long-term shareholder value 
is established through robust 
corporate governance that is ethical 
and sustainable. The objective of 
corporate governance is to ensure 
equity for all stakeholders. Robust 
corporate governance is vital in 
enhancing and maintaining investor

7.	 Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of 
this disclosure)
	
I am honoured to present to you our very first sustainability Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report marking a significant milestone in our journey as a leading player in the 
Indian farm mechanisation segment. At V.S.T., we understand the urgent need to align our operations with the principles of sustainable development, hence our commitment to the ESG 
(Environmental, Social, Governance) framework.
	
Our approach towards sustainability aims to bring positive changes to the environment by identifying specific parameters of ESG. We have made significant strides in water conservation, 
increasing renewable energy consumption, and ensuring adequate hazardous waste management.
	
In the realm of renewable energy, we have installed solar panels at our plant locations at Mysore, Malur and Hosur locations. This puts us on the path to meet substantial part of our power 
requirements from renewable sources.
	
Our water conservation efforts have also paid off, with water being recycled and reused within our facilities. We have also installed stacks to reduce air pollution and created a green belt in 
and around our Malur plant..
	
Beyond our environmental efforts, we have also been addressing material ESG issues that can have potential financial implications. We have calculated our emissions from energy 
consumption, allowing us to continuously track, monitor, and aim to reduce our carbon footprint.
	
On the governance front, we have maintained our commitment to transparent and ethical practices, as demonstrated by our recertification for QMS - ISO 9001:2015, EMS - ISO14001:2015, 
and Safety - ISO 45001:2018. We firmly believe that effective corporate governance is the bedrock of a successful commercial enterprise and we are proud of our strong legacy in this area.
	
Our social responsibility efforts focus on the wellbeing of our greatest asset: our employees. We strive to foster an inclusive culture that encourages diversity and offers training and 
development opportunities to all. Upholding the mental and physical health of our employees is our top priority, and we continually strive to ensure a safe workplace in accordance with the 
requirements of the Factories Act. Our motto, "Zero Accident", underscores this commitment.
	
We consider the publication of this inaugural Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report as a testament to our robust corporate sustainability strategy, which places a key emphasis on 
environmental stewardship, social responsibility, and good governance. Our goal is to create a sustainable future for our company, our stakeholders, and the communities we serve.
	
We appreciate your support in this endeavour and look forward to your active engagement as we continue to refine our sustainability strategy and strive to make a significant difference in 
the world.
