is built. Our Research and Development (R&D) division stands as the propelling force driving the Company’s mission to set new 
industry standards. Simultaneously, we hold steadfast in our commitment to embrace a diverse array of technological breakthroughs. 
The heart of our R&D initiatives beats to the rhythm of creating pioneering products and transformative modifications that amplify 
customer contentment, elevate the bar of quality, ensure unwavering safety, and fortify dependability. This virtuous cycle results 
in a decreased overall cost of ownership, all while strictly adhering to the rigors of stringent emissions regulations.
	
A fraction of our overall R&D and capital expenditure (capex) investments are diligently channelled into specific technologies with 
the aim of enhancing both environmental and societal impacts tied to our products and processes. This targeted allocation stands 
in proportion to the entirety of our R&D and capex endeavours, each bearing testament to our commitment.
	
Within the annual report, the allocation of both capital and revenue expenditures for Research and Development undertakings 
has been meticulously categorized under the respective headings. However, due to the intricate interplay of these expenditures, 
the task of segregating them into discreet categories remains a practical challenge.
