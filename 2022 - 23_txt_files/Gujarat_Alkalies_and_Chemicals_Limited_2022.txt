and reused. The Company has also planned 
to purify sewage water of Vadodara Municipal 
Corporation and use in the plant. A floating 
solar power plant has been installed in one 
of the water reservoir to reduce evaporation 
losses.

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, 
targets and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure).
 
Right from its inception in 1973, Gujarat Alkalies and Chemicals Limited has remained a very progressive, 
forward looking and socially responsible corporation. As a result, in its 50th year since inception, the Company 
is proud to look back at its trajectory of last 50 years, wherein from a very modest start with a caustic soda 
manufacturing capacity of 37425 MTA, the Company today enjoys the lion’s share in the market with 8,52,750 
MTA of Caustic Soda. This has been a phenomenal and sustainable growth journey, which also demonstrated 
company’s commitment towards diversification, inclusive growth, environment protection, conservation of natural 
resources and increasing use of renewable energy.  
 
The Company has earned its reputation amongst its customers as a dependable, ethical, transparent and 
accountable supplier. At the same time, the Company remained committed to meeting expectations of all 
other stakeholders, including employees, suppliers, investors, regulators, statutory bodies, neighbours, and 
community at large.   
 
Envisioning towards a dynamic, modern, and eco-friendly chemical company with enduring ethics and values 
in India, we at Gujarat Alkalies and Chemicals Ltd. are always responsible and sensitive towards environment, 
Social and Governance. Under the broader umbrella of Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG) we at 
GACL perform our business with the utmost responsible manner. We are always committed towards highest 
ethical standards and to ensure products and processes to be of the highest quality, we always look for 
continuous development of our process and performance. We at GACL always ensure to comply with all 
applicable legislations and other requirements which we subscribe. 
 
The major factors, amongst others, which have contributed to Company’s sustainable growth journey are as 
under: 
 
Embracing new technologies
 
At a very early stage of its growth journey, way back in 1989, the Company played a trend-setter’s role 
in Caustic Soda Industry in India by switching over to the membrane-based process from mercury-based 
process, which gave a great boost to its efforts towards cleaner technology, environment protection and energy 
conservation. The Company was very first in India to use single loop controllers for process automation, 
way back in 1986. Since then, the Company has always been on fore-front to update its technologies and 
processes from time-to-time.
 
Diversified Product Portfolio
 
The Company’s diversified product portfolio, built over the years through forward integration, comprising more 
than 35 products as of now, has significantly reduced Company’s dependence on Caustic soda group of 
products, thus building its resilience for sustaining during cyclic changes in caustic soda industry.
 
The Company’s products are used as feedstock by diverse industries like, aluminium, textiles, rayon, soaps 
& detergents, pulp & paper, fine chemicals, dyes, paints, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, metal treatment, 
petroleum refining, polymers & plastics, fertilisers, refrigerants, propellants, disinfectants, sugar refining, beverages, 
food preservatives, effluent treatment and drinking water purification. The Company is proud to be a partner 
in supply of clean drinking water to the community with use of its unique product, poly aluminium chloride, 
being used by several local bodies like Delhi Jal Board, Bruhad Mumbai Municipal Corporation, and many 
other municipal corporations across the country. 
 
In most cases, the Company’s products, for their consistent quality and dependability, earn premium over 
similar products offered by our peers. As a result, most of the plants are operating at close to or higher 
than their rated capacities.
 
Diversified Energy Sourcing
 
The Company’s operation are highly energy intensive. The Company maintains diverse sources for electrical 
power supply which include Company’s own gas based power plant at Dahej, participation in a gas based 
power plant of GIPCL at Vadodara, power sourced from exchange, back-to-back power supply arrangements 
from a thermal power plant through GUVNL, grid power and, the most importantly, from its own Captive 
Renewable Wind and Solar Plants of more than 208 MW capacity, which contribute to the extent of about 
25% of Company’s electrical power requirement. The Company also uses hydrogen (produced as co-product 
in its operations) as a fuel, which helps reducing Company’s carbon footprint to a significant extent.

Efficient Supply Chain Management
 
The Company sources its major raw material salt from a large number of Micro, Small and Medium Sized 
salt manufacturers located within a radius of about 200 KM. The Company also provides technical assistance 
to these salt producers for efficient salt farming and production of high-quality salt.  These arrangements 
not only ensure the best quality requiring minimum consumption of chemicals for further purifications but 
also a dependable supply chain. Similarly, owing to the proximity of rail, road and sea transport facilities, 
the Company is able to transport its products at far away destinations with reasonable costs. The Company 
also has a country wide strong dealer network, which serves as extended arms of the Company in reaching 
out to all the end users of its products. The Company also serves many of its nearby customers through 
dedicated pipelines.
 
Continuous learning and innovation
 
We believe in continuous learning and upgradation which is the key to the sustainable growth in our business. 
The adaptation to the most modern technologies, efficient processes, and minimum wastages have not only 
helped the company in maximising discharging its responsibilities to the society at large, but have also helped 
in optimizing the operating cost. 
 
With this we are happy to share that, we have developed improved process for manufacturing high purity 
guaiacol, cold water-soluble methyl cellulose, High Purity Vanillin, Cold Water-Soluble Hydroxy Propyl Methyl 
Cellulose. In addition to this, we have developed improved process for the crystallization for manufacturing 
sodium percarbonate powder and treating sodium cyanide containing liquid effluent on Industrial scale. Also, 
we have developed improved process to produce hydrazine hydrate as well, for which commercial production 
has already commenced. Contributing towards “AatmaNirbhar Bharat Abhiyan” GACL had considered putting 
up a plant to manufacture Hydrazine Hydrate (N2-H4.H2O) for which our country is mostly dependent on 
other countries. The indigenous environment friendly technology developed by us is our contribution towards 
the dream of our nation i.e., “Make in India”. For this, we had closely collaborated with the Indian Institute 
of chemical technology (Hyderabad), one of the leading CSIR laboratories and received joint patent in India 
and USA for this process.
 
In GACL we have strategized water recycling plan and initiatives for water conservation which is being taken 
care of by our R & D Department. We had developed In-house Scale Corrosion Inhibitors (i.eScalewins) 
and Biocides (i.e.Biowins) formulations, which are used to control Scale, Corrosion, Fouling and Biological 
growth in Cooling Water System. Here, the cooling water treatment is carried out with in-house tailor-made 
formulations as per need of cooling water system. For this, our R&D team provide the required technical 
support. The role of these formulations is to control scale & corrosion of cooling water system and conserve 
large quantity of water by means of increase in Cycle of Concentration (COC) of cooling towers. We achieved 
high COC with this treatment. We are happy to share that during the scarcity of water in Dahej area all 
cooling towers of each plant could be run without regular blowdown using our formulation and treatment 
while achieving same performance as standards of cooling towers.
 
Responsible Corporate Citizenship
 
We at GACL believe that development of the society where we live, can lead us to new heights and 
successes in our business. Under CSR activities for the development of the community we are continuously 
working on areas like promotion of education, Home for Mentally Differently abled Children/Special children 
(HMDC), healthcare, hygiene & sanitation, sustainable livelihood, skill development, promotion of art, culture, 
and heritage, and water conservation. In addition to this, we also emphasize on projects of human development 
index. In several education projects, we broadly map rural infrastructure gaps and intervene to provide 
required infrastructures, including construction and refurbishment of Anganwadis, community halls, housing, 
high mast towers, classroom projects, providing teachers in secondary schools & mid-day meals. To emerge 
as a model and exemplary organization in the field of social work, we are working towards holistic growth 
and sustainable development of communities at large with focused social upliftment.
 
We at GACL always give priorities to holistic growth encompassing development on environment, social and 
governance fronts. We have also been continuously nurturing environment through development of green 
belts, prevention of soil erosion, rain water harvesting and installations of renewable energy sources.   
 
It is evident that our sustained growth over a period of half a century is the result of our holistic approach 
as described above. We intend to continue growth in our business together with our valuable contribution in 
the growth and upliftment of all our stakeholders.  We remain committed to sustainability achieved through 
these means.

a. Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)
Yes. GACL has established practices to ensure sustainable sourcing of key raw materials. A supply chain and purchase 
policy in place. The policy is available at https://www.gacl.com/upload_files/86543_supply_chain.jpg
Few major activities of sustainable sourcing are mentioned hereunder:
Our Company has a policy of procurement which reflects sustainable sourcing taking into consideration economical 
aspect in procurement, environmental friendly processes and giving due weightage to social aspects.
In our endeavor of sustainable sourcing we have appealed all our major suppliers to adopt sustainable sourcing in 
their business.
One of the major raw materials is Salt which is a natural product being produced from either sea water or from 
subsoil water by natural evaporation process in sun light. No chemical which may harm environment is used during 
manufacturing process. It is transported in bulk in vehicle and no packaging material is used. Considering environment 
friendly usage, we had changed specifications of Salt from July 2017 and washed Salt is used at both the complexes. 
By using improved quality salt, chemical consumption and sludge generation has reduced considerably. We procure 
about 8 (eight) lakhs MT of Salt for Baroda & Dahej complexes from the manufacturers who have salt works spread 
over different locations within State and these comprise very small to large manufacturers. We have been using Rail 
rakes instead of Trucks for transportation of major quantity of Salt from faraway places like Maliya, Gandhidham 
which is eco-friendly means of transportation.
Another major raw materials are  Potassium Chloride and Rock Phosphate  which are natural materials available in 
the mines. Both these are imported materials from Canada & Jordan and annual consumption is about 0.60 Lakhs 
MT & 1.60 Lakhs MT respectively for manufacturing of Potassium Hydroxide & Phosphoric Acid respectively.
Being natural material no processing is required for meeting our requirement and hence no chemicals are consumed. 
Both the materials are transported in bulk by ship by aggregating the requirement of multiple users thus saving in 
fuel consumption. Local transportation of Rock Phosphate is also done in bulk. However, local transportation of 
Potassium Chloride is done in bags which are reusable & recycled. Both these materials are nonhazardous and not 
harmful to the operating people.
Packaging materials like carboys, barrels, bags etc. which are used for filling the finished products are procured 
from the nearby sources and from small vendors. These packaging materials can be recycled & reused for other 
purposes. In procurement of certain raw materials like Lime, Alumina Tri Hydrate we have changed packaging size 
from 50 kg to jumbo bag of 1 MT. Jumbo bags can be reused for other purposes.
We support MSME vendors, procure material from them, strive to release payment to them as per government 
directives and indirectly help to create employment.
We have multiple sources of power viz. renewable energy and state grid. We are sourcing natural gas from GAIL 
and GSPL.
For entire (100%) procurement of our Company, we follow Procurement Policy of our Company that supports 
sustainable sourcing.
2.  b.  If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?
Majority inputs were sourced sustainably. GACL is committed to ensure further sustainable sourcing to optimize the 
sources of supply.

3. 
Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end 
of life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.
Plastic waste, Battery waste and E-waste are sent to approved GPCB approved recyclers. Hazardous wastes are 
disposed of as per the Hazardous & Other waste (Management & Transboundary Movement) Rules-2016 and its 
amendments. Sludge materials are being sent for land filling. 
Liquid and solid types of organic hazardous waste aresent to GPCB approved incinerators or pre-processors. The 
final product is being used as fuel in cement industries. Spent oil is being sent to GPCB approved recycler.
Biomedical waste is generated in very low quantities and sent to approved GPCB incinerator.
4. 
Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes / No). If yes, whether 
the waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to Pollution 
Control Boards? If not, provide steps taken to address the same.
GACL does not fall under the ambit of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR), as per the waste management rules 
(the E-Waste Management Rules 2016, 2018 and 2023, the Plastic Waste Management Rules 2016 and the Battery 
Waste Management Rules 2022) formulated by Central Government. No consumer products are manufactured by GACL 
involves plastic, electrical component, and battery. Hence, Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is not applicable.
