Footprint of 
operations
Risk & 
Opportunity
RISK
The Company’s only limited activities pose 
risks to the local environment and surrounding 
communities, including biodiversity impacts, 
emissions into the air, water discharges, 
natural resource consumption, and waste 
generation. Managing and accessing these 
environmental risks are crucial to avoid 
potential legal and reputational issues.
OPPORTUNITY
There are opportunities for the Company to 
address these risks and enhance its reputation 
by implementing sustainable construction 
practices, 
conducting 
comprehensive 
environmental 
impact 
assessments, 
engaging stakeholders, and investing in 
innovation and research. By embracing 
these opportunities, the Company can 
minimize negative environmental impacts, 
comply with regulations, and position itself 
as a responsible and sustainable leader in 
the industry
The Company is actively mitigating 
the risk associated with footprints 
of 
operations 
by 
implementing 
robust environmental management 
systems, 
conducting 
regular 
assessments, 
and 
adopting 
sustainable 
practices. 
Through 
responsible resource consumption, 
waste 
reduction 
initiatives, 
and 
stakeholder 
engagement, 
the 
Company strives to minimize its 
environmental impact, protect local 
ecosystems, and ensure the well-
being of surrounding communities.
NEGATIVE
The financial implications of the identified risk 
include potential negative impacts such as 
increased costs for addressing environmental 
issues, potential fines or penalties for non-
compliance with regulations, and potential 
legal expenses. These financial implications 
can lead to a decrease in profitability and cash 
flow if adequate measures are not taken to 
manage and mitigate environmental risks.
POSITIVE
Implementing 
sustainable 
construction 
practices 
and 
effectively 
managing 
environmental 
risks 
can 
enhance 
the 
Company’s 
reputation 
and 
attractiveness 
to environmentally conscious clients and 
partners. This can lead to increased business 
opportunities, a competitive edge in obtaining 
new projects, and potentially higher project 
value. Additionally, proactive engagement with 
stakeholders and investment in research and 
innovation can drive efficiency, cost savings, 
and long-term financial sustainability.
2.
Energy 
Management
Opportunity
The identification of energy management 
as an opportunity for the Company stems 
from the potential benefits of enhancing 
overall 
energy 
efficiency, 
diversifying 
energy sources, and accessing alternative 
and renewable energy. By implementing 
energy-efficient technologies and systems, 
the Company can reduce costs, improve 
operational efficiency, and mitigate the risks 
associated with energy price fluctuations. 
Furthermore, the installation of a rooftop solar 
power plant demonstrates the Company’s 
commitment to renewable energy, which not 
only reduces dependence on conventional 
sources but also aligns with sustainability 
goals. Embracing energy management as an 
opportunity can enhance competitiveness, 
contribute to a greener future, and strengthen 
the Company’s environmental stewardship.
-
POSITIVE
By enhancing overall energy efficiency, the 
Company can reduce energy consumption 
and associated costs, leading to potential cost 
savings and improved profitability. Diversifying 
energy sources and accessing alternative and 
renewable energy can also contribute to long-
term financial sustainability by mitigating the 
risks of energy price fluctuations and reducing 
reliance on conventional energy sources. 
Additionally, investing in renewable energy 
initiatives, such as the rooftop solar power 
plant, may provide opportunities for incentives, 
subsidies, and long-term cost savings through 
reduced energy bills. Overall, effective energy 
management 
can 
positively 
impact 
the 
Company’s financial performance and enhance 
its competitive position in the market.

Waste 
Management
Opportunity
The Company has categorized waste 
management 
as 
an 
opportunity 
by 
implementing 
responsible 
waste 
management 
practices, 
such 
as 
minimizing waste generation and ensuring 
environmentally 
responsible 
disposal. 
Through meticulous waste segregation, 
reuse of materials within its operations, 
and responsible disposal through approved 
vendors, the Company aims to minimize its 
environmental footprint, conserve resources, 
and comply with regulatory requirements. 
This commitment to sustainable waste 
management not only reduces potential 
negative 
impacts 
but 
also 
presents 
opportunities for cost savings, resource 
efficiency, and enhanced environmental 
stewardship.
-
POSITIVE
By minimizing waste generation and promoting 
resource efficiency, the Company can reduce 
waste disposal costs, optimize material usage, 
and potentially generate revenue through 
the sale of reusable materials. Furthermore, 
complying 
with 
regulatory 
requirements 
mitigates the risk of fines and legal liabilities, 
while 
demonstrating 
a 
commitment 
to 
sustainable 
practices 
can 
enhance 
the 
Company’s reputation, attract environmentally 
conscious clients, and contribute to long-term 
financial sustainability.
4.
Community 
Development 
Risk & 
Opportunity
The 
categorization 
of 
Community 
Development (Human Rights & Community 
Relations) as both a risk and an opportunity 
stem from the potential impacts of the 
Company’s long-term construction activities 
on 
local 
communities. 
Risks 
include 
community dissatisfaction and potential legal 
issues arising from environmental and social 
impacts.
On the other hand, the opportunity lies in 
engaging with stakeholders and prioritizing 
community interests to foster positive 
relationships, obtain a social license to 
operate, enhance the Company’s reputation, 
and drive long-term business sustainability. 
The Company is committed to 
mitigating 
the 
risk 
associated 
with Community Development by 
promoting community development, 
respecting 
human 
rights, 
and 
fostering strong community relations, 
the Company aims to build trust, 
enhance its social license to operate, 
and create shared value for both the 
Company and the communities it 
serves.
NEGATIVE
Negative 
impacts 
such 
as 
community 
dissatisfaction, legal issues, and reputational 
damage can result in increased costs, potential 
litigation expenses, and a loss of business 
opportunities. 
Additionally, 
addressing 
environmental and social impacts may require 
additional investments in mitigation measures, 
potentially impacting profitability and cash flow 
in the short term.
POSITIVE
By 
prioritizing 
community 
engagement, 
respecting human rights, and obtaining a social 
license to operate, the Company can benefit 
from enhanced reputation and community 
support. This can lead to increased customer 
loyalty, attracting socially conscious investors, 
and opening doors to potential partnerships and 
business collaborations. The positive financial 
implications may include improved long-term 
profitability, access to new markets, and cost 
savings through streamlined operations and 
reduced conflicts with local communities.

5.
Workforce 
Health and 
Safety
Risk
The categorization of Workforce Health 
and Safety as a risk is based on the high 
fatality and injury rates in the EPC industry 
compared to other sectors, as well as the 
increased vulnerability of temporary workers 
due to lack of training and experience. 
Failing to effectively manage these risks can 
result in human suffering, legal liabilities, and 
financial costs. 
The Company prioritizes workforce 
health and safety by implementing 
comprehensive 
safety 
protocols, 
providing 
regular 
training 
programs, and fostering a strong 
safety culture. By conducting risk 
assessments, ensuring compliance 
with occupational health and safety 
regulations, 
and 
continuously 
monitoring and improving safety 
practices, 
the 
Company 
aims 
to protect the well-being of its 
employees. Through these efforts, 
the Company seeks to minimize 
accidents, injuries, and fatalities, 
creating a safe and healthy work 
environment 
while 
enhancing 
employee morale, productivity, and 
retention.
NEGATIVE
Workplace accidents and injuries can result in 
increased costs, including medical expenses, 
compensation claims, potential legal liabilities, 
and 
regulatory 
fines. 
Additionally, 
such 
incidents can lead to project delays, increased 
insurance premiums, and reputational damage, 
impacting the Company’s profitability and 
hindering its ability to secure future projects
6.
Materials 
Sourcing
Opportunity
The categorization of Materials Sourcing 
as an opportunity is based on the potential 
to reduce direct and indirect greenhouse 
gas emissions and integrate value chain 
partner 
considerations 
effectively 
into 
the Company’s business strategy. By 
strategically selecting suppliers with lower 
carbon footprints, promoting sustainable 
practices, and incorporating responsible 
supply chain management, the Company can 
enhance its environmental reputation, attract 
environmentally conscious customers, and

Systematic 
Risk 
Management
Risk
The categorization of Systematic Risk 
Management as a risk is based on the need 
for the Company to successfully implement 
measures to address business continuity 
risks and enhance system resilience. Failure 
to effectively manage these risks can lead to 
operational disruptions, financial losses, and 
reputational damage. Although implementing 
such measures may incur upfront costs, 
the Company is likely to benefit from lower 
remediation expenses in the long term, 
as proactive risk management enhances 
operational 
efficiency, 
risk 
mitigation 
capabilities, and business continuity during 
high-impact disruptions.
The 
Company 
is 
dedicated 
to 
mitigating 
systematic 
risks 
by 
implementing 
robust 
risk 
management 
strategies 
and 
processes. 
Through 
proactive 
identification, 
assessment, 
and 
monitoring of potential risks, the 
Company aims to minimize the impact 
of high-impact disruptions on its 
operations. By establishing business 
continuity 
plans, 
implementing 
effective 
crisis 
management 
protocols, and fostering a culture of 
risk awareness and preparedness, 
the Company seeks to enhance its 
resilience and ensure the continuity 
of its operations. These systematic 
risk management efforts not only 
protect the Company’s financial 
performance but also contribute to its 
long-term sustainability and ability to 
secure new projects with confidence.
NEGATIVE
Failure 
to 
effectively 
address 
business 
continuity risks and enhance system resilience 
can result in significant financial losses due 
to operational disruptions, increased costs 
for remediation and recovery, and potential 
reputational damage. Additionally, the lack of 
preparedness for high-impact disruptions may 
lead to lost business opportunities, customer 
dissatisfaction, and potential legal liabilities, 
further impacting the Company’s financial 
performance.

Product and 
Process 
Innovation
Opportunity
The categorization of Product and Process 
Innovation as an opportunity is based 
on the potential to adopt sustainable 
construction methods that reduce the 
Company’s

impact. 
By 
utilizing renewable and recyclable materials, 
minimizing 
embodied 
energy, 
reducing 
energy consumption, minimizing waste, and 
protecting natural habitats, the Company 
can enhance its environmental stewardship 
and reputation. Additionally, embracing 
innovative 
solutions 
and 
alternative 
strategies reflects a commitment to social 
and environmental responsibility, attracting 
conscious 
consumers, 
and 
gaining 
a 
competitive edge in the market. Overall, 
product and process innovation offer the 
Company a chance to align its operations 
with sustainability goals, drive positive 
change, and capitalize on the growing 
demand for sustainable practices.
-
POSITIVE
Embracing product and process innovation in the 
adoption of sustainable construction methods 
can have positive financial implications for the 
Company. By using renewable and recyclable 
materials, 
reducing 
energy 
consumption, 
minimizing waste, and implementing innovative 
solutions, the Company can achieve cost 
savings through improved resource efficiency, 
reduced operational expenses, and decreased 
waste disposal costs. Moreover, the positive 
environmental 
reputation 
gained 
through 
these innovations can attract environmentally 
conscious customers, enhance brand value, 
and open new market opportunities, leading 
to increased sales, customer loyalty, and long-
term financial sustainability.

Business 
Integrity and 
Ethics
Risk
The categorization of Business Integrity and 
Ethics as a risk is based on the Company’s 
exposure to various risks related to bribery, 
corruption, and anti-competitive practices.
Either in the Manufacturing operations or 
in the EPC, the Company is entangled into 
managing complexities arising out due to 
multiple local agents and subcontractors, the 
complications of project financing and project 
permitting, the magnitude of the contracts.
The Company places a strong 
emphasis on business integrity and 
ethics by adhering to high ethical 
standards and promoting a culture 
of honesty and transparency. By 
implementing 
robust 
governance 
structures, 
conducting 
regular 
ethics training, and enforcing strict 
compliance measures, the Company 
strives to prevent bribery, corruption, 
and 
anti-competitive 
practices. 
Through these efforts, the Company 
aims to safeguard its reputation, 
maintain the trust of stakeholders, 
and ensure long-term sustainability. 
By prioritizing business integrity 
and ethics, the Company not only 
mitigates legal and reputational 
risks but also fosters a positive 
working environment and fosters 
strong relationships with customers, 
suppliers, and partners.
NEGATIVE
Instances of bribery, corruption, and anti-
competitive practices can result in financial 
penalties, 
legal 
costs, 
and 
reputational 
damage. These negative outcomes can lead 
to loss of business opportunities, customer 
distrust, reduced market share, and potential 
legal liabilities, all of which can significantly 
impact the Company’s financial performance 
and long-term sustainability.
POSITIVE
Effectively managing and prioritizing business 
integrity and ethics can have positive financial 
implications for the Company. By establishing 
an 
ethical 
culture, 
implementing 
robust 
governance 
structures, 
and 
maintaining 
strong internal controls, the Company can 
minimize the financial risks associated with 
unethical practices. This includes avoiding 
legal penalties, reputational damage, and loss 
of business opportunities. Moreover, a strong 
commitment to business integrity and ethics 
can enhance the Company’s reputation, attract 
ethical business partners and investors, and 
foster customer loyalty, resulting in increased 
sales, market share, and long-term financial 
sustainability.

Sustainable sourcing:
Does 
the 
entity 
have procedures in 
place for sustainable 
sourcing? (Yes/No)
Cable Business:
Yes, the Company has successfully incorporated a Supplier Framework with the explicit objective of 
fostering sustainable sourcing practices. This comprehensive framework encompasses the meticulous 
evaluation and selection of suppliers, primarily based on three fundamental criteria, namely:
•
Quality: This criterion pertains to the meticulous assessment of the suppliers’ products or 
services, encompassing factors such as performance, durability, reliability, and compliance with 
industry standards. By prioritizing quality, the Company aims to ensure that the sourced materials 
or services meet the highest standards and align with its own commitment to excellence.
•
Pricing: The Company diligently considers the financial aspect when assessing potential 
suppliers. This entails evaluating the overall cost-effectiveness and competitiveness of the 
proposed pricing structures. By meticulously scrutinizing pricing, the Company strives to strike 
a balance between obtaining optimal value for its investments while maintaining profitability and 
cost-efficiency.
•
Delivery: Timeliness and reliability of delivery are key factors in the selection process. The 
Company places great emphasis on suppliers’ ability to deliver products or services within agreed-
upon timeframes, maintaining consistency and minimizing disruptions to its own operations. By 
prioritizing efficient and reliable delivery, the Company seeks to uphold its commitment to meet 
customer demands and operational timelines.

Further, suppliers are evaluated and ranked according to their performance in relation to the 
aforementioned parameters. Additionally, the Company has established Environmental Requirements 
for its suppliers, which are communicated to them.
During the supplier registration process, the Company conducts an evaluation to assess their 
suitability. A Supplier Registration Questionnaire is sent to suppliers to gather information regarding 
Quality, Environment, Occupational Health & Safety, and compliance with Statutory & Regulatory 
Requirements.
EPC Business:
Within the framework of the EPC Business Segment, materials are procured using two distinct 
channels: direct sourcing and sourcing through contractors. Throughout the sourcing process, careful 
attention is given to the following factors:
•
Standards & Specifications: The procurement process adheres to established benchmarks, 
such as BIS certifications, which serve as quality and compliance standards for the materials 
being sourced.
•
Contractor Selection: A comprehensive criterion is employed to select & empanel contractors. 
This criterion encompasses a range of parameters which includes evaluation of various techno-
commercial as well as financial parameters enabling the ranking of contractors and facilitating 
informed decisions regarding sourcing preferences.
•
Ongoing Contractor Monitoring: Regular and periodic evaluations are conducted to monitor 
the performance of contractors on the basis of performance, quality consciousness, target 
achievement & other parameters. This monitoring process ensures that contractors consistently 
meet the required standards and maintain the expected level of quality and efficiency.
By incorporating these considerations into the sourcing procedures under the EPC Business Segment, 
the organization ensures that materials are procured in accordance with predefined standards and 
specifications while maintaining a robust system for contractor evaluation and monitoring.

recycling 
and 
disposing at the end 
of life, for (a) Plastics 
(including packaging) 
(b) 
E-waste 
(c) 
Hazardous waste and 
(d) other waste.
Cable Business:
The Company ensures that the cables supplied to customers possess a minimum lifespan of 25-30 
years. To ensure transparency and proper handling of end-of-life treatment, customers are provided 
with a comprehensive Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) that contains detailed information on the 
appropriate procedures for disposal or treatment.
Given that the cables are predominantly utilized by industrial entities, the responsibility for the effective 
management of end-of-life treatment lies with the customers themselves. This entails adhering to the 
guidelines specified in the MSDS and complying with the relevant laws and regulations in force during 
that period.
Regarding waste generated within the Company, stringent measures are implemented to ensure 
compliance with environmental laws and consent conditions. Specific waste categories are handled 
as follows:
•
Plastic Waste: The Company responsibly sells plastic waste to authorized recyclers, thereby 
promoting sustainable waste management practices.
•
E-Waste: In line with regulatory requirements, the Company sells electronic waste exclusively to 
authorized recyclers, ensuring proper recycling and disposal.
•
Acid Batteries: The Company follows a buy-back policy with Original Equipment Manufacturers 
(OEMs) to ensure the safe and environmentally sound disposal of acid batteries.
•
Hazardous Waste: All hazardous waste generated is meticulously disposed of through authorized 
recyclers, adhering to strict guidelines and safety protocols.
•
Other Non-Hazardous Waste: The Company adopts a responsible approach by selling non-
hazardous waste to trusted vendors who can appropriately handle and utilize the materials.

EPC Business:
Within the EPC Business Segment, two primary waste streams are generated: Construction & 
Demolition waste and Metallic Scrap waste. These waste materials are effectively managed through

Metallic Scrap waste, on the other hand, is sold exclusively to authorized vendors who possess the 
necessary expertise and infrastructure for proper recycling, disposal and utilization of these materials. 
By adopting such practices, the Company aims to reduce environmental impacts and contribute to 
sustainable waste management practices within the EPC Business Segment.

PRINCIPLE 4: BUSINESSES SHOULD RESPECT THE INTERESTS OF AND BE RESPONSIVE TO ALL ITS STAKEHOLDERS
ESSENTIAL INDICATORS:
1.
Identification of stakeholders group:
Describe the processes 
for 
identifying 
key 
stakeholder groups of 
the entity
The Company has developed a stakeholder engagement framework to improve the process of 
identifying stakeholders. This framework is intended to increase the effectiveness of engagement 
with stakeholders, which is essential for maintaining the Company’s reputation, building trust, and 
creating value for all stakeholders.
The stakeholder engagement framework consists of two dimensions, which are crucial in identifying 
stakeholders. The first dimension relates to the stakeholder’s interests, while the second dimension 
is concerned with the stakeholder’s level of influence. By considering both of these dimensions, 
the organization can identify stakeholders and determine the appropriate modes and levels of 
engagement required for each stakeholder group.
In addition to these dimensions, the Company also takes into account several criteria when 
identifying stakeholder groups. These include:
(a)
The stakeholders’ level of dependency on the organization,
(b)
The level of responsibility they have in relation to the organization,
(c)
The amount of attention they receive from the organization, and
(d)
Their level of influence over the organization.
By using this stakeholder engagement framework and considering these criteria, the Company 
can better identify the stakeholders who are most crucial to its success and develop engagement 
strategies that align with their needs and interests. This approach is critical for maintaining positive 
relationships with stakeholders and achieving the organization’s strategic objectives.

Waste management practices adopted in the establishment:
Briefly describe the

practices adopted in 
your establishments. 
Describe the strategy 
adopted 
by 
your 
company to reduce 
usage of hazardous 
and toxic chemicals 
in your products and 
processes 
and 
the 
practices adopted to 
manage such wastes.
The Company has implemented a suite of waste management practices to curtail waste generation 
and ensure that all waste is handled in an ecologically responsible manner.
Cable Business:
The storage, collection, and disposal of hazardous waste adheres to consent conditions. The 
hazardous waste generated is disposed of by vending it to Authorised Recyclers approved by the 
Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). Similarly, solid waste is also disposed of in compliance with 
Consent Conditions.
Although the manufacturing process of cables employs non-hazardous materials, certain waste 
material is categorized as hazardous due to the recycling process involved.
EPC Business:
This Business Segment places significant emphasis on the proper segregation of waste materials.
Following meticulous sorting, two primary approaches are taken: firstly, where possible, segregated 
waste materials are reused internally to minimize waste production and encourage efficient resource 
usage.
Secondly, any waste that cannot be reused in-house is vended to approved vendors who have 
the competence to responsibly handle and manage such materials. These practices exemplify 
the Company’s commitment to sustainable waste management and play a part in reducing the 
environmental impact of our operations.

Community redressal mechanism:
Describe the mechanisms to receive and redress grievances of the community.
The implementation of an effective Grievance Redressal Mechanism (GRM) is vital in fostering a strong bond with the community

To ensure that community members have a platform to voice their concerns, the Company has established a readily accessible 
and efficient grievance redressal mechanism. Within this framework, local employees regularly engage with the community, 
actively seeking out grievances and addressing them in a timely manner.
Upon receiving feedback or complaints, the Company undertakes a comprehensive investigation of the matter at hand, leaving 
no stone unturned. This diligent process enables the Company to gather all relevant information and ascertain the appropriate 
actions required to rectify the situation. Swift corrective measures are then implemented to effectively resolve the grievances
