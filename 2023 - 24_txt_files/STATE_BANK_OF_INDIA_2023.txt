into its operations, portfolio and 
value chain. In addition, the report 
discloses 
information 
on 
the

Responsible Business Conduct (NGRBC).  
Scope and Boundary 
The non-financial disclosures presented in 
this report cover SBI’s activities and progress 
on a standalone basis for the reporting period 
FY24, i.e., 1st April 2023 to 31st March 2024. The 
report covers SBI’s domestic and international 
operations, which include the Corporate Centre 
establishment in Mumbai and establishments 
in various geographies across India and 241 
overseas offices. There were no significant 
changes to the organisation or its supply chain 
during the reporting period. For environmental 
KPIs 
[Greenhouse 
Gas 
(GHG) 
emissions, 
energy, water, waste], the reporting boundary 
encompasses 
only 
the 
Bank’s 
domestic 
operations.
Materiality
In FY24, SBI undertook a materiality refresh 
exercise to reassess the topics most critical 
to the Bank and its stakeholders. As per the 
guidance provided in GRI Universal Standard 
2021, these topics significantly influence the 
Bank’s operations and are integral to its value-
creation process. The report provides detailed 
information on these identified topics.  
Approach of the Report
The 
report 
focuses 
on 
the 
relationship 
between SBI’s key concerns, its strategy, risk 
management 
approach 
and 
governance 
structure within its operating environment. 
It describes how the Bank’s business model 
has influenced various aspects, including its 
financial, manufacturing, intellectual, human, 
social and relationship and natural capitals. 
Prepared by a collaborative, interdisciplinary 
team led by the Chief Sustainability Officer, 
the report consolidates contributions made by 
different business units and control and support 
functions across the Bank. The content of this 
report has been reviewed and approved by the 
Board of Directors.

its Sustainability and Business Responsibility 
(BR) Policy, which guides its overall ESG 
performance. The Bank has implemented 
mechanisms to identify and manage significant 
risks. The Bank’s approach to mitigating risks 
and managing its economic, environmental and 
social performance is also communicated to its 
stakeholders.

that define SBI’s plans and expectations, 
based on rational assumptions and previous 
performance. They depend on developments 
in the industry, changes in the macroeconomic 
conditions, government regulations, laws and 
other incidental factors. The statements must 
not be used as an assurance of the Bank’s future 
performance, as the underlying assumptions 
may change significantly.

Stakeholder Engagement
Dear Stakeholders,
I am delighted to present to you our Sustainability 
Report for FY24, which captures yet another 
year of our dedicated efforts in achieving 
operational efficiencies along with improving 
sustainability in our business activities. During 
the year, we reaffirmed our commitment to 
sustainable banking practices which result in 
positive social impact, embodying the ethos of 
“Synergising Sustainability: Within and Beyond”. 
The report aptly encapsulates the Bank’s 
sustainability journey in internal operations, 
robust governance, strong risk management 
framework and aspirations of our stakeholders. 
Additionally, 
it 
highlights 
the 
Bank’s 
role 
in contributing to a sustainable ecosystem 
beyond its operations, positively influencing 
the 
environment, 
society, 
economy 
and 
stakeholders including our customers through a 
diverse range of initiatives.
The Bank has been publishing details of its ESG 
performance through the annual Sustainability 
Report as per Global Reporting Initiative 
(GRI) guidelines since FY17 and Business 
Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting since 
FY23 in compliance with the SEBI guidelines. 
Bank is committed to developing a culture 
of sustainability in every aspect of Banking 
through employee engagement, automation of 
processes, compliance with regulatory reporting 
framework and capacity building initiatives. 
The Sustainability and ESG space has been 
evolving rapidly in recent times and there 
continue to be many policy and regulatory 
interventions which help in sensitising the 
market players on the criticality of ensuring that 
their operations are sustainable. The Securities 
and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has 
introduced the updated BRSR framework in July 
2023, compliance of which is mandatory for the 
top 1000 listed entities (by market capitalisation) 
from FY24. Further top 150 listed entities have to 
mandatorily undertake reasonable assurance of 
the BRSR Core. The framework also introduces 
disclosures for value chains that top 250 listed 
entities have to make from FY25. Augmenting 
the ESG disclosure to include value chain 
signifies the growing importance of synergising 
Sustainability not only within the organisation 
but also beyond it.
Reserve Bank of India’s Report on Currency 
and Finance (RCF) dated 3rd May 2023 further 
underscores 
the 
pivotal 
role 
of 
financial 
institutions in supporting sustainable economy 
by incorporating ESG considerations into their 
decision-making processes and assessing the 
long-term sustainability of businesses and 
investments. Another significant step by the RBI 
in this direction is the proposed introduction 
of a Disclosure framework on Climate-related 
Financial Risks published in February 2024, 
requiring regulated entities (REs) to disclose

information 
on 
governance, 
strategy, 
risk 
management & metrics and targets.  ESG 
reporting landscape thus is constantly evolving, 
demanding establishing and streamlining of 
systems and processes to address the concerns 
of all the stakeholders. 
India is accelerating its efforts to address climate 
change and achieve its net-zero targets by 2070 
by developing a low-carbon transition strategy 
and promoting responsible consumption. The 
Government of India’s focus on solar power 
development projects, increased investments 
in renewable energy and support for climate 
technology is a testimony to this.  Additionally, 
in the Union Budget 2023-24, significant 
investments were allocated to “green growth”, 
focusing on the transition to net zero by green 
energy adaptation, enhancing climate resilience 
and fostering the growth of bio economy.
Being India’s largest public sector bank, SBI 
recognises its role in driving India’s progress 
towards sustainable development and has 
aligned its ESG strategy towards fulfilling 
national 
commitments 
and 
integration 
of 
Climate risk in Sustainable finance, while 
ensuring regulatory compliance. 
SBI is integrating ESG criteria in its product 
offerings and policy development, reducing 
carbon footprint by digitalisation of processes 
and other initiatives such as purchasing green 
energy and is also driving green transition in 
India by supporting sustainable activities while 
promoting economic growth. Bank has an ESG 
Financing Framework, in alignment with the 
Sustainable Finance Guidelines and Principles of 
International Capital Market Association (ICMA), 
which serves as a roadmap for our bond and loan 
issuance programmes, ensuring that proceeds 
are 
directed 
towards 
supporting 
eligible 
activities and projects with environmental or 
social benefits.  During the year, we successfully 
raised USD 250 million through green bonds, in 
accordance with our ESG Financing Framework. 
Bank has put in place a Policy on issuance of 
Green Deposits and Financing Framework in 
accordance with RBI guidelines.
Bank has also constituted a top-level Climate 
Change 
Risk 
Management 
Committee 
to 
enhance governance and resilience in the face 
of climate-related risks and to provide strategic 
guidance and oversight to ensure that climate 
considerations are integrated into our risk 
management framework.
Another significant milestone achieved this 
year is the consolidation of the ESG and Climate 
Finance functions under a dedicated unit – 
the ESG & Climate Finance Unit (ESG & CFU). 
Conceived as a “Horizontal Business Unit” the 
unit is positioned to steer the Bank efforts in 
climate finance, targeting a net-zero pathway 
(Scope 1, 2 and 3) for the Bank by its centenary 
year in 2055. The Unit aims to facilitate minimum 
of 7.5% of the Bank’s domestic loan portfolio to 
be ‘green’ by 2030. Leveraging expertise from 
various departments, the Unit ensures focused 
attention, improved coordination and control, 
capitalising on emerging business opportunities 
and developing a green portfolio for the Bank, 
thereby catalysing the green transition of the 
economy.
SBI also partners with various international 
agencies, Multilateral Development Banks and 
Development Financial Institutions to make 
available affordable credit to the emerging 
sustainable commercial activities. Bank deploys 
the Lines of Credit (LoCs) availed from these 
institutions to fund projects that help create a 
positive environmental and social impact. Bank 
has also introduced “SBI Green Rupee Term 
Deposit” in line with the RBI guidelines, the 
proceeds of which will be used for supporting 
eligible green activities.
Bank is progressing towards Carbon neutrality 
target in internal operations by leveraging 
favourable green tariff policies and through 
open access channel via solar/wind to enhance 
the procurement of renewable energy for its 
large establishments. Additionally, we have 
been striving to reduce carbon emissions of

our operations by installing solar panels on our 
own buildings / ATMs and improving energy

have been certified by the Indian Green Building 
Council 
(IGBC) 
under 
different 
categories 
(Platinum/Gold/Silver) and it will be our endeavor 
to continue our efforts in this direction. 
As a socially responsible organisation, SBI 
actively contributes to India’s pursuit of the 
United 
Nations’ 
Sustainable 
Development 
Goals. We continue to develop products and 
services that are aligned with the objectives 
of the seventeen UN SDGs, such as finance for 
biofuel projects, SME loan for the healthcare 
sector and the YONO platform to meet the 
dairy farming needs of farmers, amongst others. 
We also launched Surya Shakti – Solar Finance 
tailored for business entities seeking to install 
solar rooftop/ground-mounted grid-connected 
systems for captive use. We have also devised a 
simplified loan product at affordable terms to 
support the mass solarisation mission under the 
PM Surya Ghar initiative.
As we navigate the ever-evolving banking 
landscape, we anticipate a significant shift 
towards digital services. Our goal continues to 
be a customer-focused, digital, competitive and 
agile bank, combining the convenience of digital 
banking with a human touch. In order to cement 
Bank’s leadership in the digital banking space 
and to make YONO more intuitive, seamless and 
customer friendly, Bank is launching the next 
generation of YONO- YONO 2.0. The ‘Only YONO 
- The New Digital Bank’ (YONO 2.0) envisages 
a total revamp of YONO platform, not only in 
terms of features and functionalities, but also 
in terms of ease of use and enhanced customer 
experience. With the strengths of CRM and AI, 
the App will serve as a financial superstore for all 
segments of society, offering financial, banking 
and beyond-banking services. By fulfilling a wide 
range of customer needs and requirements 
digitally, YONO 2.0 is expected to play a key role 
in Bank’s sustainability agenda.
The Bank continues to be committed to 
prioritising 
financial 
inclusion 
and 
has 
introduced a novel feature allowing customers 
to enroll in various Social Security Schemes 
at the Bank’s Customer Service Points (CSPs) 
using only Aadhaar card number. This initiative 
aligns with the Bank’s mission to empower all 
segments of society by eliminating barriers 
to financial security and advancing financial 
inclusion through digitalisation. 
Bank recognises Human Resources as its core 
strength for achieving the desired outcomes 
in financial parameters as well as in the 
sustainability 
aspirations. 
Our 
skilled 
and 
committed workforce of more than 2,30,000 
people is the backbone of our organisation who 
drive all our efforts and initiatives with dedication 
to ensure that we continue to play the vital role 
in supporting businesses and individuals in 
achieving their aspirations. We are dedicated 
to creating an inclusive and empowering 
environment 
for 
our 
people, 
emphasising 
continuous engagement, skill enhancement, 
equal 
growth 
opportunities, 
health 
and 
safety, which ensures talent retention. We are 
committed to promote gender parity within 
our organisation and take conscious efforts to 
ensure inclusivity and equal opportunities to 
everyone. As a result, Bank continues to be the 
most preferred employer in the financial sector. 
Our well established and elaborate training 
infrastructure not only aims at imparting the 
relevant skills and shaping right attitude of our 
employees but also contributes significantly 
to overarching goals of the Bank. To meet 
the multifaceted training requirements of 
a 
sustainable 
workforce, 
comprehensive 
programmes such as “Samanvay”- for First 
time role holders, upskilling programmes for 
the new recruits, “Prerak” and “Samarthya”- 
utilising multigenerational profile of employees 
and external training programmes for senior 
functionaries are held.
We 
continue 
to 
extend 
services 
to 
our 
employees post their retirement also through 
programmes such as “Project SBI Cares”, which 
automates 
and 
streamlines

The Ethical Audit Committee documented the 
findings and proposed measures to strengthen 
the Bank’s commitment to business integrity.

Vigilance
The Vigilance department is headed by a 
Chief Vigilance Officer (CVO) of MD rank who 
is appointed by the Government of India in 
consultation with CVC and reports to the 
Chairman. The CVO assists the top management 
in the formulation, implementation and review 
of the Bank’s policy on all vigilance matters. 
To assist the CVO in his task of supervision of 
vigilance matters in circles/verticals/subsidiaries, 
the Government of India has appointed six (6) 
Additional Chief Vigilance Officers (Addl. CVOs) 
on deputation basis in SBI at various locations.
During the year, Vigilance Awareness Week 
was observed from 30th October 2023 to 5th 
November 2023, with the theme “Say no to 
Corruption; commit to the Nation”. All channels 
of the Bank such as SBI Times, ATMs, CDMs, 
Internet Banking, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram 
and LinkedIn were used extensively to create 
awareness among employees and public on the 
theme of Vigilance Awareness Week (VAW). All 
the awareness campaigns were run through 
digital channels of the Bank, thereby reducing 
paper 
consumption 
and 
conserving 
the 
environment.
In a move towards inculcating the true spirit 
of participative vigilance, CVC also ran a three-
month campaign as a precursor to Vigilance 
Awareness Week. One of the focus areas of 
this campaign was Capacity Building wherein 
extensive training programmes were conducted 
during the campaign period. The capacity 
building programmes was further extended 
to cover value chain, BCs and CSPs. During the 
campaign period, the Bank imparted training to 
21,000+ officers and 56,000+ CSPs.
To bring about structural efficiencies and 
processes consistencies, the Bank initiated 
digitisation of the entire disciplinary process, in 
a single platform called as DPMS (Disciplinary 
Proceedings Management Portal).  The portal 
captures the entire life cycle of disciplinary cases 
establishing a central database and repository 
for them. The  portal has notably enhanced 
transparency in reporting . It also has  the facility 
for uploading documents of the case and 
has helped in reducing the multiple printing 
of papers and thereby reducing the carbon 
footprint.
The Vigilance department has conducted 1,570 
preventive vigilance programmes, 84 training 
sessions for EO/PO/IA training, having total 32,775 
officers. In addition to conducting Suo-moto 
investigations in complaint prone branches 
and 
branches 
where 
serious 
irregularities 
were observed by the RFIA Auditors, Suo-moto 
investigations were carried out in High-Risk & 
Very High-Risk branches identified by our AI/ML 
engine, to ensure and improve the preventive 
vigilance measures. The use of AI/ML has helped 
us in reducing the time and paper in analysing 
the risk profile of the branches. Suo-moto 
investigations were conducted in 1,475 branches.

Risk Management Process
Independent risk measurement, monitoring 
and control functions are crucial aspects of 
ensuring the stability and soundness of a 
financial institution. The banking sector is 
exposed to several systemic risks, which have 
the potential to cause cascading impacts on 
the overall socioeconomic landscape. As the 
largest bank of the country, SBI has a critical 
role in the Indian economy. Recognising the 
significance of the Bank’s role in the financial 
system, regulators have identified the Bank as a 
Domestic-Systemically Important Bank (D-SIB). 
This designation highlights the institution’s 
importance and the need for robust risk 
management practices.

Enterprise Risk Management Process
Enterprise Risk Management is a forward-
thinking framework designed to manage and 
align risk with strategy at the enterprise level. 
It encompasses global best practices such as 
establishing a Risk Appetite Framework, a Risk 
Culture Assessment Framework and a Material 
Risk Assessment Framework.
As part of the Bank’s vision to transform the role 
of risk into a strategic function, the Board has 
approved an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) 
Policy. This policy includes the Risk Appetite 
Framework, which sets limits for significant risks 
and includes monitoring parameters. To ensure 
the safety and stability of its operations, the Bank 
has implemented strategies to systematically 
measure, assess, monitor and manage risks 
across its portfolios. These frameworks are 
established based on global best practices. 
To promote a strong risk culture, a Risk Culture 
Assessment Framework has been implemented. 
In addition, the Material Risk Assessment 
Framework includes periodic analysis of risk-
based parameters for Credit Risk, Market Risk, 
Operational Risk and Liquidity Risk, among 
others, which is presented to the Enterprise and 
Group Risk Management Committee (EGRMC) 
/ Executive Committee of the Central Board 
(ECCB). The Bank follows a comprehensive four-
step approach to risk management, covering:
Risk 
Identification
Risk Assessment 
& Measurement
Risk  
monitoring
Risk 
Mitigation
Risk Management Universe
The Bank employs various models to assess and mitigate risks and model risk is mitigated through 
industry best practices in every stage of the model lifecycle. The models are classified based on 
materiality into High, Medium and Low risk tiers for effective process efficiency and resource 
utilisation.

Factoring-in Risk Assessment into ICAAP 
SBI conducts a yearly comprehensive Internal 
Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) 
exercise to assess the adequacy of capital under 
normal and stressed conditions at individual 
and group levels. During the ICAAP, new and 
emerging risks are identified and thoroughly 
analysed. The ICAAP assesses Credit Risk, Market 
Risk, Operational Risk, Liquidity Risk, Interest 
Rate Risk in Banking Book (IRRBB), credit 
concentration Risk and other risks. Capital is 
provided where required and new and emerging 
risks are identified and discussed in the ICAAP. 
This proactive approach ensures that the Bank is 
prepared to face any challenges that may arise.
Business Continuity and Operational Resilience Policy
To ensure that the Bank’s operations can continue without any disruptions, 
even in the face of natural calamities, a comprehensive Business Continuity and 
Operational Resilience (BC & OR) Policy and Manual has been implemented. 
By adhering to industry-leading best practices, complying with ISO 22301:2012 
and regularly reviewing and evaluating the Business Continuity Plan, the 
Bank is well-prepared to navigate any potential disruptions and maintain its 
operational resilience.
	 A training programme was conducted at State Bank Academy (SBA), Gurugram, on 
Climate Change Risk Management, in association with Climate Policy Initiative (CPI), 
which is an independent, not-for-profit organisation and a leading source of analysis and 
solutions for climate action and green growth. 
	 A one-day seminar titled ‘Climate Finance 
and Risk’ was organised by the Bank to 
serve as a platform for knowledge exchange, 
collaboration and the evolution of innovative 
ideas. At this forum, representatives from 
DFS, MoEFCC, RBI, public and private sector 
banks and Subject Matter Experts shared 
their perspective on Climate Finance and 
Risk and delved into the complexities of 
opportunities and challenges it presents.
Special Trainings and Seminars on Climate Change Risk Management
Integration of Climate Risks into Risk 
Management Process
SBI strives to enhance its resilience in the face 
of impending climate risks.  The Bank has 
established an apex level executive committee - 
Climate change Risk Management Committee. 
The Committee provides strategic guidance and 
oversight to ensure that climate considerations 
are integrated into the Bank’s risk management 
framework. 
Furthermore, 
the 
Bank 
has 
formulated a Climate Change Risk Management 
Policy which aims to mitigate risks and capitalise 
on growth opportunities. Climate Change risks 
faced by the Bank can be categorised as follows:
	 Physical 
risks 
arise 
from 
direct 
and 
observable changes in the climate system. 
These 
risks 
can 
cause 
economic 
and 
financial losses and are categorised as 
either acute risks or chronic risks. Acute 
risks are event-driven and arise from 
extreme weather conditions such as floods, 
heatwaves, cyclones or wildfires. Chronic 
risks, on the other hand, arise from long-
term changes in the climate patterns, such 
as an increase in temperature, changes in 
precipitation, sea level rise and so on.
	 Transition risks arise from changes in policy, 
technology and market dynamics required 
to address climate change and transition 
towards a low carbon economy. These risks 
include policy and legal risks, technology 
risks, market risks and reputation risks. 
The 
Bank 
is 
committed 
to 
identify 
and 
addressing 
these 
risks 
constructively 
and 
proactively. By doing so, it strives to promote a 
sustainable future. 
Climate-related Risk Scenario Analysis
The utilisation of scenario analysis provides 
insight into potential long-term pathways for 
the future, illustrating the correlation between 
human activities, GHG emission concentration 
and global temperature change.  The Bank is 
cognizant of the adverse impact the Climate 
Change risks may have on its portfolio. At the 
portfolio level, bank is in process of setting up 
framework to identify climate-related risks, to 
develop mitigation plan for mitigating such risks. 
The Bank is in process of measuring its financed 
emissions. 
Subsequently, 
scenario-based 
assessments will be used to create roadmaps 
for incorporating climate sustainability into its 
portfolio.
Building Risk Culture - Sensitising 
Employees on Risk Management
The Bank has implemented an RMCB-approved 
framework to assess risk culture among staff. To 
create an effective risk culture, the Bank provides 
continuous training, conducts annual surveys, 
sets up specific assessment groups, encourages 
active 
risk 
identification 
and 
reporting, 
promotes risk reporting and whistleblowing 
and integrates risk culture into human resource 
processes.

Stakeholder Engagement and Materiality

Laying a Strong Foundation for Value Creation
Stakeholder Engagement Process
SBI is dedicated to delivering outstanding 
banking services to its key stakeholders. The 
Bank strives to provide value-added customer 
experiences, 
generate 
profitable 
returns 
for investors and foster a supportive work 
environment for employees. Additionally, it 
drives positive industry change through strategic 
partnerships, 
contributes 
to 
communities 
through meaningful collaborations, adheres 
to laws and regulations and maintains strong 
relationships with vendors. To ensure that its 
stakeholders’ expectations are met, SBI conducts 
regular comprehensive engagement exercises, 
actively seeking feedback and integrating it into 
its operations to create meaningful impact.
SBI’s stakeholder engagement and materiality assessment are fundamental to creating lasting 
value. By understanding stakeholder needs, the Bank shapes its strategy and enhances customer 
experience. Through materiality assessment, the Bank identifies critical areas impacting the 
economy, environment and people, guiding strategic decisions for sustainable operations.
To identify stakeholders, SBI assesses potential stakeholders’ interests, expectations and requirements. 
The Bank then analyses engagement priorities based on influence and legitimacy. This process helps 
priortise the Bank’s critical stakeholders. The Bank actively engages with stakeholders to understand 
their concerns and expectations, which in turn informs the Bank’s approach to material topics. By 
doing so, it diligently works towards addressing these concerns and fulfilling expectations.
Bank’s Stakeholder Engagement Process
The Corporate 
Centre 
Sustainability 
Committee 
(CCSC) holds 
discussions and 
deliberations 
to identify the 
stakeholders of 
the Bank.
The stakeholders 
are prioritised at 
the Bank on the 
basis of power, 
influence and 
legitimacy.
The Bank 
connects with 
stakeholders 
through various 
channels for 
determining the 
material topics.
The Bank 
improves its 
relationships with 
stakeholders by 
addressing their 
concerns and 
meeting their 
expectations.

Double Materiality Assessment 
In FY23, SBI updated its material topics in 
line with the GRI - Universal Standards 2021. 
A comprehensive list of 27 ESG topics was 
developed through a peer review, emerging ESG 
priorities and stakeholder engagement. The list 
of universal material topics has been annexed to 
this Report. The Bank collected feedback from 
internal (employees) and external stakeholders 
(retail 
customers, 
wealth 
customers 
and 
local 
community 
representatives) 
through 
customised questionnaires. The questions were 
designed to assess the likelihood, magnitude 
and impact of risks and opportunities associated 
with each material topic. After analysing the 
responses, the Bank identified priority material 
topics for each stakeholder group, aligning 
with its business aspirations, strategic priorities 
and risks. The Corporate Centre Sustainability 
Committee 
(CCSC), 
the 
Bank’s 
highest 
governance body for sustainability, subsequently 
approved the final list of 12 key material topics 
crucial to the business. In FY24, a refresh of the 
Process of Assessment of Material Topics
materiality assessment was conducted. This 
process included a review of peer practices, 
ESG standards and frameworks and leadership 
discussions, leading to the proposal of three 
new topics – Digital Leadership, Economic 
Performance and Climate Action – for inclusion 
in the Bank’s ESG material topics list. The CCSC 
endorsed the addition of these topics after 
due deliberations. This exercise included only 
internal stakeholder discussions.
In FY24, an impact analysis was conducted 
through internal consultations and leadership 
discussions. It involved identifying key business 
risks and opportunities with functional leaders 
and mapping relevant KPIs and targets to 
integrate sustainability with the Bank’s business. 
A leadership survey assessed the business 
impact of ESG risks and results were analysed 
alongside FY23 stakeholder survey to revise the 
materiality matrix.

the economy and a reduction in provisioning 
costs.

expansion

proactive measures against climate change 
to mitigate climate related risks. The policy is

towards 
natural 
resource 
management, 
taking in to account SEBI’s latest guidelines 
on Business Responsibility and Sustainability 
Reporting (BRSR). The Bank is also committed

The Bank promotes sustainability practices 
among employees and customers by observing 
environmental awareness days such as World 
Environment Day and World Soil Day. The 
Bank has instituted a ‘Sustainability Pledge’,

Calculation Methodology
Electricity
The monthly electricity expenses of all branches is taken from a centralised Vendor Portal system 
(VPS). The state-wise average unit cost (INR/kWH) is calculated from the data of monthly electricity 
consumption (kWH) and average amount paid towards electricity bill (INR) from a sample set of 
branches/offices. The ratio between electricity expenses (INR) of branches across each state (VPS) 
and derived unit cost across each state from sampled branches gives the electricity consumption 
for all branches/offices. This is multiplied by a specific emission factor to arrive at emissions due to 
purchased electricity under Scope 2.
Diesel
For FY24, diesel consumption data (in litres) is captured from the sample set of branches/offices 
along with ownership details. Average consumption per branch is calculated from the sample 
diesel consumption data, which is then extrapolated to the overall population. The percentage 
of Bank-owned/third-party DG sets is applied to total diesel consumption data to calculate the 
emissions from Bank-owned/third-party DG sets under Scope 1 and 2.
Business Travel
The data of employee travel for various modes of transport such as rented taxi, buses, trains and air 
travel is recorded in the Bank’s HRMS portal, alongside corresponding expenditure and distance 
travelled. Based on the distance obtained from the HRMS portal, specific emission factor for each 
mode of transport is applied. 
Total emissions due to business travel = Distance travelled (by each mode) X Specific emission 
factor for each mode of transport  
Mobile Combustion-owned/rented Vehicles
The information regarding Bank-owned vehicles from circles/offices along with type of fuel, total 
fuel consumption/distance travelled is recorded. The emissions due to these vehicles is considered 
under Scope 1.
A similar methodology is adopted for rented vehicles to arrive at emissions due to business travel 
under Scope 3.
Fugitive Emissions - Fire Extinguishers
The Bank uses CO2-based fire extinguishers across locations and data of cylinders refilled during 
the reporting period is collected from the sample list of branches. The average value is then 
applied to overall branches on the  basis of  population category to arrive at the overall refilled 
quantity. Specific Global Warming Potential (GWP) is applied for calculating emissions.
Fugitive Emissions - Refrigerants Leak from AC and HVAC
The Bank tracks data regarding the refrigerants used to replenish air conditioning encompassing 
both HVAC and split ACs along with details of the type of refrigerant utilised and quantity of 
refrigerant refilled from the sample set of branches. For ACs, the data is extrapolated to all 
branches considering population size across metro, rural, semi-urban and Urban areas. For 
HVACs, data regarding refilling is directly utilised for the calculation without extrapolation given 
that HVAC systems are installed only in select few locations included in the sample size. Specific 
Global Warming Potential (GWP) is applied for calculating emissions.  
Waste Generated in Business Operations
The data for waste generated is collected by the Bank from a sample set of branches in metros, 
urban, semi-urban and rural areas. Data consists  of the  type of waste generated along with 
its disposal method. This  data is extrapolated to the number of branches to obtain total waste 
generated. 
For e-waste, generated and recycled  data is collected from all circles/offices.
Carbon Neutrality
The Bank has committed to be Carbon Neutral (Scope 1 and 2) by the year 2030 in its internal 
operations. To achieve its carbon neutrality target, the Bank is in the process of implementing an 
integrated actionable strategy roadmap built around three main pillars: 
(i)	
Reducing the Bank’s carbon footprint on the supply side 
(ii)	 Promoting sustainable practices on the demand side 
(iii)	 Retiring carbon offsets for the residual emissions
Demand-side Interventions Undertaken
(i)	 Replacement of old ACs to energy-efficient ACs
(ii)	 Installation of energy efficient equipment such as  LEDs.
(iii)	 Installation of electric vehicle chargers
Supply-side Interventions Undertaken
On-site solar installations
Switching to open access / green tariff
Replacement of DG sets by solar power systems/switching to cleaner fuel
As per the Sustainability and Business Responsibility (BR) policy, to percolate the sustainability 
measures, Circle Sustainability Committees (CSC) have been formed to monitor sustainability 
performance at the circle level and CCSC Committee at the Corporate Centre oversees the overall 
performance.
Waste Management
Given its nature of business, the Bank’s 
significant sources of waste generation are 
limited to food waste such as computers, 
phones, etc.
In its efforts to manage waste effectively, SBI 
has undertaken the Reducing, Reusing and 
Recycling (3R) approach and follows responsible 
waste 
segregation 
and 
disposal 
practices. 
Among the different types of waste produced, 
e-waste emerges as particularly significant due 
to its environmental impact. The Bank has also 
formulated an e-waste policy to ensure safe and 
responsible disposal, recording and reporting of 
electronic waste. 
The Bank focuses on reducing paper usage 
and promoting environmentally responsible 
behaviour through extensive digitalisation of 
products and processes for internal operations 
and implementing Green Banking practices, 
including paperless banking. 
The Bank also sensitises its employees and 
public alike on responsible waste management 
practices through awareness sessions and 
regularly conducts clean-up drives.

Measuring Employee Engagement
During the reporting year, the Bank conducted Abhyuday – an 
annual employee engagement survey to gauge the engagement 
level of its employees and assess employee metrics related to job 
satisfaction, stress levels, purpose and happiness of employees. The 
engagement level of employees of the Bank was compared with 
global, Indian and Banking, Financial Services and Insurance (BFSI) 
average engagement levels. 
95% employee 
participation makes 
Abhyuday one of the 
largest employee 
engagement surveys 
in the world.
As per an analysis of the responses received, 
66% of the Bank’s employees are ‘engaged’ 
employees, surpassing the industry average 
of 65% within the BFSI sector. Furthermore, a 
significant 82% of the Bank’s workforce is actively 
contributing to the Bank’s accomplishments. 
The percentage of ‘disengaged’ employees is 
the lowest (5%) when benchmarked against 
industry standards.
The insights from survey results have been 
shared with the Bank’s circles for further analysis 
and preparation of specific action plans to ensure 
that employee happiness and contribution level 
in the Bank are at their optimum level.

The Bank ingrains a culture of learning, deep 
within the organisation, fostering a remarkable 
environment for employee growth and personal 
development. By providing a comprehensive 
array of in-house and expert-led training and 
development programmes, the Bank ensures 
that its workforce remains abreast of the latest 
industry knowledge and skills. This proactive 
approach not only empowers employees to 
excel in their respective roles but also enables 
them to actively contribute to the overall success 
of the Bank. 
The Bank’s overarching training strategy is 
formulated in accordance with the Annual 
Policy Guidelines, taking into consideration 
emerging trends, corporate priorities, alignment 
with Business Units’ (BUs) objectives and global 
best practices. Central to this approach is the

and governed by the Apex Advisory Council, 
which acts as the focal point for all training, 
learning and development initiatives.
With a nationwide presence, the Bank’s training 
infrastructure comprises six state-of-the-art 
Apex 
Training Institutes (ATIs) and 51 regional State 
Bank Institute of Learning and Development 
(SBILDs). The ATIs play a pivotal role in shaping 
the Bank’s future readiness by serving as think 
tanks and mentoring SBILDs while remaining 
attuned to external policy developments at both 
macro and grassroots levels. Also, the research 
wings at ATIs prepare impact studies and offer 
policy support for various Government initiatives

training sessions, such as faculty skills, topic 
coverage and training usefulness. Moreover, 
iTRAMS administers entry and exit tests for 
identified programmes and regularly assesses 
scores to gauge immediate learning efficacy.

Customer Grievance Redressal 
The Bank has put in place a “Customer Rights, 
Grievances Redressal and Compensation Policy” 
covering various aspects related to customer 
service, like the Right to Fair Treatment, Right 
to Transparency, Fair and Honest Dealing, 
Right to Suitability, Right to Privacy and Right 
to Grievance Redressal and Compensation. The 
policy is reviewed annually and the updated 
version has been placed on the Bank’s website. 
The Bank has a mechanism in place specifically 
for Unauthorized Electronic Debit Transaction 
(UAED) complaints as per which, the digital 
channel through which siphoning of funds is 
reported, is blocked as soon as UAED complaints 
are registered in the CRM portal. The Bank 
also ensures that the liability of the customer 
is fixed within the TAT specified by RBI for 
UAED complaints. The Bank has also rolled out 
Customer Liability Identification Centre (CLIC) 
- a centralized dedicated cell at all 17 circles to 
fast-track complaints arising out of UAED.
The Bank has a robust online Complaint 
Management System (CMS), where customers 
can lodge their complaints, feedback and 
suggestions 
online. 
A 
sophisticated 
and 
advanced CMS module has been integrated 
into the CRM. The customers can also submit 
grievances, 
provide 
feedback 
and 
make 
suggestions regarding its services and products 
in the Customer Request and Complaint Form 
(CRCF) through the Bank’s website, Internet 
Banking page or mobile banking apps in 
addition to contact centre. Designated email 
IDs for grievances are available on the Bank’s 
website.
All complaints and feedback received through 
these channels are recorded in the CRM 
portal with a unique ticket number, which is 
communicated to the customer via a registered 
mobile number or email. The resolution of 
grievances is similarly communicated through 
SMS or email. Customers have the option to rate 
the quality of grievance redressal either through 
the CRCF page or by contacting the Contact 
Centre. Additionally, the Bank seeks feedback 
on the redressal process through SMS sent to 
customers.
All complaints, received at the Bank are dealt 
with as per the Grievance Redressal Policy of 
the Bank and partially/fully rejected complaints 
of 
customers 
are 
escalated 
to 
Internal 
Ombudsman as stipulated by the Reserve Bank 
of India.
Besides offering multiple easy channels for customers to register complaints, the Bank 
deeply analyses the underlying reasons behind each grievance. Its dedicated teams conduct 
comprehensive reviews to identify process gaps, training inadequacies, coordination issues and 
policy loopholes that may have led to the problem. The Bank has also taken steps to eliminate 
process deficiencies and improve processes for example 
A pop-up message “KYC overdue, please contact branch” on login page at INB/ YONO application 
has now been made available for information to the customers, which was not available earlier.

Beneficiary Identification for Targeted 
Implementation
The beneficiaries of the respective initiatives are 
selected based on their socio-economic status, 
experience, understanding of the business 
landscape and knowledge and skill relevant 
to the proposed venture. Reports from Credit 
Information Companies (CIC) are examined for 
existing loans and repayment history, aiding 
in assessing creditworthiness and repayment 
capacity.
 The Bank carefully manages lending to 
prevent the financial strain that can occur from 
excessive debt, ensuring that beneficiaries 
maintain a healthy economic status. To keep 
loan repayments manageable and avoid over-
indebtedness, 
comprehensive 
assessments 
are conducted. These assessments calculate 
total repayment obligations by considering 
all existing debts and the proposed loan 
repayments, adhering to the RBI’s microfinance 
loan guidelines, which state that the total 
repayment should not exceed 50% of the 
borrower’s 
income. 
This 
approach 
helps 
safeguard borrowers from financial difficulties 
while managing their repayments effectively.

Our Limited Assurance engagement was with respect to the year ended March 31,2024 
information  only unless otherwise stated and we have not performed any procedures with 
respect to earlier periods or any other elements included in the Sustainability Report and, 
therefore, do not express any conclusion thereon. 
 
Management’s 
Responsibilities 
for 
the 
identified 
non-financial 
sustainability disclosures 
The Bank’s Management is responsible for preparing the report that is free from any material 
misstatement in accordance with the reporting criteria (GRI Standards 2021 as well as DJSI 
Guidance) for disclosures under identified sustainability information. 
The Bank’s Management responsibilities include designing, implementing and maintaining 
internal controls relevant to the preparation and presentation of the report that is free from any 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The company ensures that it complies 
with the GRI Standards 2021 and all local regulations. It designs, implements and effectively 
operates controls to achieve the stated control objectives; selects and applies policies; makes 
judgements and estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances; and maintains adequate 
records in relation to the Report. 
The Bank’s Management is also responsible for preventing and detecting fraud and for 
identifying and ensuring that the company complies with laws and regulations applicable to its 
activities. The Bank’s Management is responsible for ensuring that the company’s staff involved 
with the preparation of the report are properly trained, systems are properly updated and that 
any changes in reporting encompass all significant operational sites. 
Inherent limitations 
The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and 
measure non-financial information allows for different, but acceptable, measures and 
measurement techniques and can affect comparability between entities. 
Our Independence and Quality Control 
We have maintained our independence and confirm that we have met the requirements of the 
Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and have the required 
competencies and experience to conduct this assurance engagement.

identified sustainability disclosures outlined in the report as well as evaluation of 
systems and procedures used for compilation and examination of identified 
sustainability disclosures incorporated in the report. 
 
Evaluation of the suitability of different assumptions, estimations, and materiality 
thresholds employed by bank for data analysis. 
 Assessed the appropriateness of calculations used for extrapolation of data for Sample 
Branches to arrive at the estimated GHG Emissions. 
 Evaluation of the bank's reporting protocol in relation to their alignment with the 
implementation of sustainability standards. 
 Checking the compliance of absentee rate disclosure in accordance with the DJSI's 
specific requirements. 
 
The procedures performed in a Limited Assurance engagement vary in nature and timing 
from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the 
level of assurance obtained in a Limited Assurance engagement is substantially lower than the 
assurance that would have been obtained had we performed a reasonable assurance 
engagement. Accordingly, we do not express a reasonable assurance opinion about whether 
the Identified Sustainability Information have been prepared, in all material respects, in 
accordance with the Criteria. 
 
Exclusions 
 Information related to company’s financial performance. 
 Strategy and other related linkages expressed in the Report. 
 Mapping of the Report with reporting frameworks other than those mentioned 
specifically. 
 Review of legal compliance. 
 The reliability of the assured data is subject to inherent uncertainties, given both the 
available methods for determining, calculating or estimating the underlying 
information. 
 We did not undertake source data verification in-person at any operated facilities. 
 Operations of the Bank other than those mentioned in the “Scope of Assurance”. 
 Aspects of the BRSR and the data/information(qualitative or quantitative)other than 
Identified Sustainability Information.

requirements, professional standards, and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. 
Our Responsibilities 
Our responsibility is to examine the Report prepared by the Company and to report on the 
select non-financial sustainability disclosures in the form of an independent Limited 
Assurance conclusion based on the evidences obtained. We conducted our Limited Assurance 
engagement in accordance with the Standard on Sustainability Assurance Engagements (SSAE) 
3000, “Assurance Engagements on Sustainability Information”, issued by the Sustainability 
Reporting Standards Board of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. That standard 
requires that we plan and perform our procedures to obtain a meaningful level of assurance 
about whether the select non-financial sustainability disclosures in the Report comply with the 
GRI standards 2021 in all material respects, as the basis for our Limited Assurance conclusion. 
A Limited Assurance engagement involves assessing the suitability in the circumstances of the 
Company’s use of the Criteria as the basis for the preparation of the Identified Sustainability 
Information, assessing the risks of material misstatement of the Identified Sustainability 
Information whether due to fraud or error, responding to the assessed risks as necessary in the 
circumstances, and evaluating the overall presentation of the Identified Sustainability 
Information. 
A Limited Assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance 
engagement in relation to both the risk assessment procedures, including an understanding of 
internal control, and the procedures performed in response to the assessed risks. 
The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment and included 
inquiries, observation of processes performed, inspection of documents, evaluating the 
appropriateness of quantification methods and reporting policies, analytical procedures and 
agreeing or reconciling with underlying records. 
Given the circumstances of the engagement, in performing the procedures listed above, we 
had: 
 Interaction with the Bank’s relevant officials to understand the entity’s sustainability 
vision. 
 Conducted virtual interviews with key personnel responsible for data management. 
 Obtained an understanding of the working of the concerned departments that are 
relevant for disclosure of the GRI Standards in the Sustainability Report.  
 Assessment of the disclosures for identified sustainability information that it was 
prepared in accordance with the sustainability reporting standards that is GRI and 
DJSI. 
 Assessed the suitability of the quantification techniques employed to determine the
