effluent that if released can cause 
health hazards. The exhaust 
chromeliquor is processed, sludge 
is recovered and subsequently 
sold to authorised chemical

contamination. The released 
wastewater is then treated before 
it is discharged while chrome 
and other solid waste matter are 
disposed of in an environmentally 
safe and efficient manner.
