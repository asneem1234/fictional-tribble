1
Financial 
prudence
Risk
Failure to identify 
potential financial risks 
and challenges could 
impact the company's 
long-term sustainability.
•	 The Management ensures that 
expenses are dynamic and 
mapped to revenue on a quarterly 
basis.
•	 Cash flow is scrutinized every 
month.
•	 Sales targets versus actuals are 
measured on a monthly basis.
•	 Expenses are sanctioned and

reviews.
Negative
2
Large 
advertising 
deals
Risk
Large advertising deals 
often involve working 
with a limited number of 
major clients or brands.
Advertising budgets can 
be sensitive to changes 
in the overall economy or 
specific industry trends.
The media industry 
is highly competitive, 
and media companies 
must continually adapt 
to changing market 
dynamics. Large 
advertising deals may be 
subject to renegotiation 
or non-renewal as market 
conditions evolve.
•	 Annual advertising deals for 
flagship programs guarantee 
that a portion of the Company’s 
annual income is ensured at the 
beginning of the financial year.
•	 Large campaigns focusing 
on societal issues and public 
awareness that set NDTV apart 
from other broadcasters are 
renewed annually to ensure 
continuity of revenue.
•	 Flagship news events are 
highlighted for special Sales deals 
and are monetized as such.
•	 The Company sells digital plus 
tv together to ensure maximum 
leverage in a crowded market and 
its Social Media strength is fast 
emerging as a USP.
Negative

Safety of 
Employees
Risk
Failure to ensure the 
health, safety and well-
being of the employees 
of the Company can 
impact productivity. This 
can consequently affect 
our business operations, 
customer satisfaction 
and profitability
•	 Regular reviews are held, including 
by Internal Auditors, to ensure 
the Company is compliant with 
all regulations applicable to 
employees.
•	 A creche is operated on the 
premises of the Company to help 
working mothers. It is staffed with 
a doctor and trained attendants.
•	 Shuttle services are provided at 
early and late hours to ensure 
women commute safely in 
Company-supervised transport.
•	 Two doctors monitor all employees 
who are sick, and a daily report is 
generated on this and reviewed 
by Management and concerned 
HODs.
•	 Offices are thoroughly sanitized 
and cleaned so as to ensure the 
well-being of the employees.

Cyber security
Risk
Cyber security risks 
encompass the potential 
for unauthorized access, 
breaches, or theft of 
sensitive information, 
including customer data, 
intellectual property, or 
financial records.
There is a need 
to take proactive 
cybersecurity measures, 
risk management, and 
continuous monitoring 
to safeguard sensitive 
data, protect operations, 
comply with regulations, 
and maintain stakeholder 
trust.
•	 The NDTV network is shielded 
from the outside world via 
Sonicwall firewall with best 
practice policies.
•	 Desktop/laptop communication on 
the network is protected via best-
in-class Cisco Umbrella end-point 
security.
•	 All computers, including Servers 
on the network also have McAfee 
EDR (Endpoint detection and 
response) protection with real-
time threat detection.
•	 Employees can access NDTV’s 
internal network from home 
through Sonicwall’s VPN 
(virtual private network). VPN is 
enabled with MFA (Multifactor 
authentication).
•	 NDTV’s email is hosted on 
Microsoft Office 365 cloud 
services and also protected with 
MFA.
•	 We also have provision of auto-
patching any security updates 
which are rolled out by Microsoft 
Window’s Security System.
•	 Entire finance system has also 
been migrated to the Oracle Cloud, 
which is one of the safest systems 
from Cyber security / threat point 
of view.
Negative
5
Technology	
Risk
Technology risk 
involves potential for 
any technology failure 
to disrupt a business. 
This cyber risk can 
come in many forms, 
including inefficiencies, 
theft, and malware. 
However, the primary 
threats revolve around 
software architecture, 
tooling, and delivery and 
maintenance.
Core IT Operations
•	 NDTV email is hosted and run on 
the cloud via Microsoft and there 
is no risk of outage other than 
those covered under standard SLA 
by Microsoft.
•	 NDTV intranet servers are 
regularly and on schedule backed 
up at Veeam backup solution 
on LTO tapes & HOT DR disaster 
recovery has been implemented 
to mitigate any possible risk 
associated with physical servers 
on-premises.
Broadcast Television
•	 Entire operations are managed 
and run in-house, inclusive of 
Studio, PCR & Transmission.
Digitalization 
•	 Both the content management 
system and the user facing

Governance, leadership and oversight
7.	
Statement by director responsible 
for the business responsibility report, 
highlighting ESG related challenges, 
targets and achievements.
The Company strongly believes that embedding Environmental, Social, and 
Governance (ESG) principles in its business operations is not only a responsible 
but an essential part of our business. Adherence to these principles helps build 
resilience, transform culture and long-term value creation to systematically 
identify opportunities, manage risk, and secure the interest of all our stakeholders.
At NDTV, corporate governance comprises rules, processes, practices, and policies 
by which the Company is managed. The spirit of governance balances the spirit 
of all the stakeholders. The result is that the governance is not incidental but
