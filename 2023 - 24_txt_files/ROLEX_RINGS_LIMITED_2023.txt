BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITY & SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING FORMAT
(Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) is the practice of companies disclosing information about their environmental, 
social, and governance (ESG) performance. It goes beyond financial reporting to provide stakeholders with a comprehensive view of a company's 
non-financial impacts and contributions to sustainable development. BRSR covers topics such as environmental impact, social responsibility, 
and governance practices, aiming to promote transparency and accountability.)

(Indicate

1.
Product Safety 
& Quality
O
Focusing on the quality and safety of 
products offers manufacturers a chance 
to tackle potential risks upfront. When 
companies make quality and safety their 
top priority, they set themselves apart from 
competitors and build a reputation for 
trustworthiness and customer happiness. 
This dedication to providing top-notch, 
safe products not only build customer 
loyalty but also boosts repeat business, 
leading to increased profits in the long run.
 Not Applicable
 Positive
2.
Employee 
well-being and 
engagement
O
Employee engagement refers to the 
emotional bonds’ individuals forge with an 
organization, shaping their commitment 
and sense of belonging. When employees 
are actively engaged, it typically leads 
to increased loyalty, reflecting positively 
on company policies and practices that 
promote 
employee 
satisfaction 
and 
retention. Conversely, a high turnover rate 
signals dissatisfaction among employees.
  Not Applicable
 Positive
3.
Opportunities 
in Clean Tech
O
Clean technology offers a promising 
opportunity 
by 
incorporating 
various 
strategies to reduce or eliminate harmful 
environmental 
impacts, 
while 
also 
fostering economic and social progress. 
Its core aim is to reduce pollution and 
waste while improving productivity and 
efficiency.
  Not Applicable
 Positive
4.
Community 
Relations 
O
The industrial machinery and goods sector 
holds a significant position in the economy, 
providing employment and contributing 
to 
community 
development 
through 
taxes and capital generation. However, it 
faces important considerations regarding 
environmental policies, community health, 
and process safety. These factors have 
wide-ranging implications for regulations, 
operations, 
finances, 
and 
reputation 
within the industry.

(Indicate

To navigate these challenges effectively, 
establishing strong relationships with 
communities becomes imperative. Such 
relationships can help mitigate potential 
operational disruptions, reduce regulatory 
risks, retain talented employees, minimize 
financial 
burdens 
associated 
with 
litigation from process safety incidents, 
and ensure a solid social license to operate. 
It's crucial to recognize that process safety 
incidents not only endanger community 
well-being but also entail regulatory 
penalties, legal actions, and significant 
mitigation costs.
5.
Occupational 
Health and 
Safety
R
Production, maintenance, repair work, and 
other on-site tasks in industrial settings 
often demand a considerable amount of 
manual labor. This dependence on manual 
labor, however, comes with inherent risks. 
Workers' exposure to powered haulage and 
heavy machinery heightens the chances 
of accidents, falls, fatalities, and injuries. 
Temporary employees, in particular, may 
be at greater risk due to their limited 
training and work experience. Neglecting 
to safeguard workers' health and safety 
can lead to fines and penalties, while 
severe incidents can cause acute injuries 
and potential liabilities through legal 
or regulatory actions. Health and safety 
risks can also result in project delays and 
downtime, increasing project costs and 
reducing profitability.'
At Rolex Rings, we routinely carry 
out health and safety audits to 
detect any gaps in occupational 
health 
and 
safety 
hazards. 
These audits encompass the 
evaluation of safety protocols, 
the use of appropriate Personal 
Protective Equipment (PPE), and 
the identification of workplace 
hazards, all in line with industry 
and health and safety standards. 
We offer regular training and 
awareness programs on safe and 
healthy practices, particularly for 
the production floor. Additionally, 
we 
provide 
mechanisms 
for 
reporting 
and 
monitoring 
occupational health and safety 
hazards 
to 
mitigate 
risks 
effectively.

6.
Material 
Sourcing 
efficiency
R
The industrial machinery and goods sector 
encounter inherent risks within their 
supply chains due to their dependence on 
essential materials used in their products. 
Many of these vital materials are obtained 
from deposits concentrated in a small 
number of countries, some of which may 
be vulnerable to geopolitical disruptions.
Furthermore, 
the 
increasing 
global 
demand for these minerals across various 
industries can lead to price fluctuations 
and 
supply 
challenges, 
consequently 
shaping a competitive environment for 
companies in this sector.
Implement 
strategies 
and 
practices in place to improve 
procurement and sourcing of 
raw materials as it is critical for 
us 
uninterrupted 
production 
process. Foster positive relations 
with our vendors and suppliers to 
ensure long term sustainability in 
material sourcing. Further, adopt 
sustainable sourcing practices 
to procure sustainably sourced 
raw materials. Implement lean 
manufacturing 
practices 
to 
ensure 
a 
timely 
production 
process and reduce high and 
frequent 
dependency 
 
on 
suppliers.
Negative
7.
Energy 
Management
R
The industrial machinery and goods sector 
frequently depends on substantial energy 
consumption to power various facilities 
and machinery, even those not directly 
engaged in manufacturing processes. 
Companies' 
decisions 
regarding 
the 
energy intensity of their operations and the 
energy sources they employ can fluctuate 
over time, impacting both operational 
efficiency and risk exposure.
Rolex Rings has a diversified 
mix of energy. This is achieved 
by 
investments 
made 
into 
renewable energy sources like 
windmill and solar installations. 
Conduct 
energy 
audits 
to 
identify high energy usage areas 
and find ways to implement 
energy efficient technologies or 
process to reduce overall energy 
consumption. 
Adopt 
energy 
management systems to improve 
energy efficiency process.
Negative
8.
Corporate 
Governance
R
Businesses undergo assessment based 
on their performance in several critical 
governance domains, including ownership 
and 
control, 
board 
remuneration, 
accounting practices, business ethics, 
and tax transparency. This evaluation 
scrutinizes how a company's corporate 
governance and ethical practices affect its 
shareholders and other investors.
Rolex Rings Limited has efficient 
policies and practices in place to 
ensure 
effective 
corporate 
governance. We will continue 
to implement robust systems 
and practices to ensure ethical 
behavior, 
transparency, 
and 
accountability 
in 
corporate 
decision-making. 
Regular monitoring, independent 
audits, and board oversight is 
essential to our business to 
operate sustainably and help 
mitigate any risk.

9.
Labour 
Relations
R
Businesses with onsite workers must 
prioritize effective labor management 
techniques. 
Factors to evaluate include workforce 
size and intensity, operational locations, 
management-labor relationship quality, 
and company commitment to worker 
rights and involvement. Attrition of skilled 
workers is a substantial operational risk 
for businesses.
We 
implement 
tactics 
that 
promote strong labor relations, 
equal 
opportunity, 
worker 
benefits, and a safe and healthy 
workplace. We have processes 
in place to address employee 
issues. By creating a transparent 
mechanism and engaging with 
employees, we improve our labor 
relations.
Negative
10.
Water 
consumption 
and waste 
water 
management
R
Companies that use an excessive amount 
of water in their production operations 
are vulnerable to water scarcity. This risk 
may lead to operational disruptions, rising 
water procurement prices, and higher 
capital 
expenditures. 
Manufacturing 
activities 
produce 
wastewater 
that 
requires treatment before discharge. Non-
compliance with water quality rules can 
result in penalties and costly compliance 
actions.
Rolex Rings factories have a 
sewage treatment facility that 
treats industrial effluent before it 
is released into the environment.
Additionally, 
we 
use 
water 
conservation measures to limit 
freshwater consumption. Monitor 
and report on water usage to find 
areas for improvement and adopt 
efficient 
water 
management 
practices.
Negative
11.
GHG 
Emissions
R
Manufacturing of Industrial machinery 
and goods equipment involves the direct 
emission of greenhouse gases. Scope 
1 emissions result from the burning of 
fossil fuels during the manufacture and 
cogeneration 
processes. 
Furthermore, 
manufacturing 
operations 
generate 
airemissions and harmful airpollutants. 
Those 
emissions 
offer 
potential 
operational concerns. This results in fines 
orexpenditures linked with regulation 
compliance. Management of  prioritizing 
greenhouse gas emissions by Using 
energy efficiently, Alternative fuels or 
improving 
production 
processes 
can 
include  unlock financial benefits such 
as enhanced operations, efficiency and 
decreased  regulations present hazards.
We have implemented effective 
emission monitoring systems to 
track and identify any harmful 
or toxic pollutants emitted into 
the atmosphere. We conduct 
frequent GHG emissions audits 
to assess the effectiveness of 
existing emission management 
methods. As a responsible vehicle 
component 
maker, 
we 
have 
deployed solar rooftop, ground-
mount, 
and 
windmill 
energy 
capacity to offset emissions. 
We will continue to invest in 
GHG reduction initiatives and 
technology.
