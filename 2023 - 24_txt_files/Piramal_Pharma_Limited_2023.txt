of the risk or opportunity
(Indicate positive or

1
Business 
Ethics
Risk
•	 PPL 
is 
exposed 
to 
regulation 
around 
the 
prevention 
of 
bribery, 
corruption, 
lobbying 
etc. 
Ethical 
business 
standards and frameworks 
are 
evolving, 
requiring 
ongoing enhancement and 
readiness.
•	 Non-compliance 
could 
result in notable financial 
and reputational impact.
•	 PPL has firmly established guiding 
principles 
to 
uphold 
ethical 
practices throughout its value 
chain.
•	 The 
Company’s 
respective 
code 
of 
conduct 
for 
board 
members, senior management, 
employees, 
suppliers, 
vendors, 
and contractors, is in alignment 
with its commitment to ethical and 
transparent business practices
Positive financial impact
2
Patient, 
Customer, 
and Consumer 
Centricity
Risk
•	 Enhanced 
regulatory 
scrutiny 
regarding 
the 
safety 
of 
patients 
and 
products, combined with 
an intensely competitive 
market, necessitates that 
the Company prioritise a 
strong emphasis on the 
needs and well-being of 
patients, customers, and 
consumers.
•	 The Company's commitment to 
patient, customer, and consumer-
centricity is anchored in its core 
principles of Knowledge, Action, 
Care, and Impact.
•	 With 
patient 
centricity 
at 
the forefront of its strategic 
imperatives the Company has 
undertaken 
several 
initiatives 
to deepen the engagement and 
improve the outcomes.
Potential 
positive 
implication 
due 
to 
customers’ trust and long-
term strategic partnership.
3
Data Privacy 
and Data 
Security
Risk
•	 Data integrity and privacy 
are critical to ensuring 
trust among stakeholders. 
With evolving regulations 
and heightened awareness 
of data privacy, there is 
a growing emphasis on 
information security.
•	 A data breach within the 
Company's 
Information 
Technology systems can 
result in significant business 
harm and reputational risk, 
inflicting damage that spans 
both financial and non-
financial spectrums.
•	 PPL has a privacy policy that 
outlines how it collects, uses, 
shares, discloses, transfers, and 
disposes of personal information 
when 
stakeholders 
use 
the 
Company’s website or other digital 
platforms.
•	 To ensure high-level data privacy 
and 
security, 
Vulnerability 
Assessment 
and 
Penetration 
Testing 
(VAPT) 
scans 
are 
conducted, and report is shared 
with 
the 
respective 
IT 
and 
Application teams for necessary 
actions.
Having a highly secure data 
privacy system has positive 
financial 
implications. 
Firstly, it helps in avoiding 
reputational 
damage 
that can arise from data 
breaches. This, in turn, 
prevents heavy fines and 
legal penalties that may 
result from compromised 
data security.
4
Product 
quality and
safety
Risk
•	 PPL’s capacity to satisfy 
patient 
needs, 
generate 
value, and establish trust 
with 
stakeholders 
is 
intrinsically linked to the 
quality and safety of its 
products.
•	 Deficiencies 
in 
these 
critical domains may lead 
to 
detrimental 
effects 
on 
stakeholders 
and, 
ultimately, on the business 
itself.
•	 PPL is on a quality advancement 
journey, 
transitioning 
from 
a 
focus on 'Quality for Compliance' 
to fostering 'Quality as a Culture.' 
This shift encompasses a holistic 
approach, 
including 
systems, 
processes, technology, and people.
•	 A dedicated Corporate Quality 
Assurance 
Group 
diligently 
monitors adherence to prescribed 
product quality standards.
•	 To 
excel 
in 
product 
quality, 
the Company implemented an 
internal strategy that includes the 
computation of the cost of poor 
quality, aiming for 'first-time right' 
outcomes
Potential 
positive 
implications of maintaining 
high product quality and 
a quality-focused culture 
include fostering customer 
loyalty 
and 
building 
long-term 
strategic 
partnerships.
5
Financial
Performance
Opportunity
•	 Owing to a burgeoning 
population, 
enhanced 
healthcare 
accessibility, 
improved affordability, the 
pharmaceutical sector is 
positioned for consistent 
growth, 
underpinned 
by 
steady 
financial 
performance 
driven 
by 
innovation 
and 
global 
market expansion.
•	 PPL strong fundamental and robust 
business model enables resilient 
business strategy to capitalise 
market opportunity effectively. 
The Company’s focus on quality 
and safety ensures overall financial 
performance.
Positive implication due to 
growing market.

6
Regulatory
Compliance
Risk
•	 Stringent 
compliance 
regulations present diverse 
challenges for companies. 
Any lapse in obtaining, 
retaining, 
or 
renewing 
compliance 
requirements 
promptly could negatively 
impact operations.
•	 Additionally, modifications 
to laws or regulations by 
governmental or regulatory 
bodies 
may 
escalate 
business operating costs.
•	 To meet compliance requirements, 
PPL conducts regulatory audits 
and ensures clearance of all 
observations.
•	 Additionally, 
PPL 
have 
a 
pharmacovigilance system in place 
to ensure timely and accurate 
reporting of adverse drug reactions 
in accordance with applicable 
norms and regulations.
Potential 
negative 
implication of the cost 
incurred on systems and 
processes to ensure strict 
compliance with applicable 
and emerging regulations 
is the financial implication 
it places on the Company.
7
Accessibility 
and 
Affordability
Opportunity
•	 The 
accessibility 
and 
affordability of medicines 
are pivotal in fostering a 
healthy life for individuals 
globally. In some cases, 
the 
elevated 
prices 
of 
medications 
can 
pose 
a 
significant 
barrier, 
hindering patients' access 
to treatments, especially 
in medium-to-low-income 
regions.
•	 PPL ensures that the products can 
be accessed by wider number of 
consumers 
through 
traditional 
distribution 
channel 
and 
e-commerce platform at affordable 
rates, thereby, ensuring affordable 
healthcare for its patients and 
customers.
Positive 
implications 
in longer run due to 
increased market share 
and development.
8
Asset Integrity Opportunity
•	 As technology continues 
to advance, higher-quality 
assets become increasingly 
accessible at cost-effective 
prices. 
Upgrading 
the 
asset base will guarantee 
improved 
operational 
efficiency and productivity.
•	 PPL 
has 
developed 
robust 
systems and processes for asset 
management, 
including 
the 
implementation of Project Catalyst 
to 
enhance 
digitisation 
and 
automation.
•	 The 
Company 
is 
assessing 
automation 
opportunities 
and 
finalising plans to align internal 
processes 
with 
Pharma 
4.0 
principles.
•	 Digitisation 
of 
Management 
Information 
Systems 
(MIS) 
across functions and sites is also 
underway.
The positive implication 
of implementing robust 
systems 
and 
processes 
for 
asset 
management, 
along 
with 
digitisation 
and automation through 
Project Catalyst, is an 
increase in productivity.
9
Business 
Continuity 
and Disaster 
Resilience
Risk
•	 Due 
to 
increased 
uncertainty 
in 
external 
environment, 
such 
as 
increased 
frequency 
of 
natural 
and 
man-made 
disasters, 
emerging 
infections, 
and 
cyber 
security 
risks, 
it 
is 
imperative for a Company 
to have robust business 
continuity 
and 
disaster 
resilience mechanism.
•	 The manufacturing facilities are 
well-equipped 
with 
resilient 
disaster 
preparedness 
plans 
encompassing, robust response 
protocols, 
effective 
rescue 
measures and efficient recovery 
processes.
•	 The Company has invested in a 
robust IT system ensures data 
security and enables the swift 
resumption of operations following 
any disruptions.
Potential 
negative 
implication 
of 
the 
expenditure 
on 
preparedness 
measures 
for disasters and supply 
chain disruptions is the 
financial burden it places 
on the company.
10
Climate 
Action/
Climate 
Change
Risk
•	 Due to rapid and evolving 
global warming and limited 
carbon budget, it is vital for 
the Company to be ready 
to Combat climate change. 
Moreover, stakeholders are 
urging swift and aggressive 
actions to address potential 
risks that may arise.
•	 PPL is committed to reducing GHG 
emissions 
with 
science-based 
targets.
•	 The Company has developed a 
robust decarbonisation plan.
•	 Renewable 
Energy 
(RE) 
consumption increased by 29%.
•	 Utilising briquettes as alternative 
fuel to reduce emissions
The 
Company’s 
commitment 
to 
sustainability 
and 
responsible 
resource 
management has led to 
positive implications due to 
reduced carbon footprint.
11
Corporate
Governance
Risk
•	 External 
regulatory 
environment for corporate 
governance varies across 
regions, 
demanding 
continuous improvement in 
standards and framework.
•	 The 
Company 
has 
a 
strong 
governance mechanism across all 
its business operations, and ensures 
a transparent communication of 
its corporate governance policies 
and protocols for a smooth 
functioning. It is also essential to 
safeguard stakeholders’ priorities 
and expectations.
Positive 
implication 
due to smooth business 
operations and enhanced 
long-term 
stakeholder 
value.
