Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes / No) 
Yes 
b. 
 If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably? 
The Company has procedures in place for sustainable sourdng of raw material in the form of buy back and exchange of old 
jewellery. The Company’s raw materials consist of gold (bullion) and diamonds. These items do not deteriorate with time and 
can be reused again and again. The Company therefore encourages exchange of jewellery wherein its customers bring in 
their old jewellery to exchange the same with new jewellery items. The Company also buys back old jewellery. This ensures 
that the Company’s demand for the fresh raw material is reduced considerably. In FY 2023-24 almost 48% of the Company’s 
requirement of raw materials in value terms was met by recycling of old jewellery. 
The gold bars consumed are procured from 
suppliers who in turn procure the same from RBI designated banks which import London Bullion Market Association certified 
gold ensuring highest purity and quality.
