A brief on the types of customers
We serve the low-income and underserved segments of the population in India, primarily in rural and semi-
urban areas, providing micro loans to support income-generation activities that empower individuals and 
communities.
We lend under the Joint Liability Group (JLG) model to women only borrowers. These women often lack 
access to traditional banking services. The small loans we provide give a steady drift to help our borrowers 
soar higher in their entrepreneurial flight while also giving them a strong chance to dream of a better life for 
their families and themselves. Our loans have a one-to-two-year tenure and are provided for purposes like 
agriculture, handlooms & handicrafts, cattle raring, cottage industries & micro entrepreneurial ventures like 
tailoring, grocery stores etc., education and healthcare.

noncompliance. These 
costs include fines, 
penalties, and legal 
fees. Practicing ethical 
behaviour leads to 
improved customer 
loyalty, thereby resulting 
in increased sales and 
revenue.
It also leads to cost 
savings as the company

loss due to unethical or 
irresponsible behaviour.

focus on further minimizing paper usage across all our offices. Additionally, we have discontinued the use of paper-based office 
stationery, except for essential items.
	x As part of our e-waste management strategy, we responsibly handle a wide range of electronic waste, including computers, servers, 
scanners, UPSs, batteries, air conditioners, and other relevant equipment. We will ensure the proper disposal of such e-waste 
materials through registered and authorized e-waste vendors.
