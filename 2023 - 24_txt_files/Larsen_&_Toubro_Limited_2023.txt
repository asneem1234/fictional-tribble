4 Higher reported cases due to increased awareness amongst stakeholders.
	
Though the Company does not have a formal grievance redressal policy/ies, there are detailed procedures in place for 
addressing the grievances across different stakeholders.
	
Details of the grievance redressal mechanism are elucidated below:
	
Investors and Shareholders: The Company has designated an exclusive e-mail id IGRC@Larsentoubro.com, to 
enable investors and shareholders to register their grievances, if any. Other mechanisms to receive the grievances are 
physical letters to the registered office address, e-mails to the Registrar and Transfer Agent (RTA), KFin Technologies 
Ltd. (KFintech) on their designated email id einward.ris@kfintech.com, physical letters or telephone call or physical visit 
to RTA, designated grievance redressal facilitation platform of SEBI – SCORES, from Stock Exchanges i.e. BSE & NSE 
through their online portals, letters received from Registrar of Companies (ROC) and complaints received on Smart ODR 
Portals of BSE and NSE. Each email received through IGRC ID is responded to wherever the details are readily available 
with the Company. All grievances received by RTA are forwarded to the Company and the Company can view scanned 
copies of these emails and replies in Karisma system (KFintech software portal). The Company regularly monitors Inward 
Report which is available on Karisma Portal of KFintech to ensure that Service Level Agreement (SLA) timelines are 
properly followed for closure of queries/complaints received. Complaints received through stock exchanges, regulators, 
ROC are monitored and the responses are uploaded on the respective regulators’ portal. The Company regularly checks 
the status of closure of these complaints. SLA for resolving all the queries as well as complaints is 30 days. On a quarterly 
basis, the Company submits a report to Stock Exchanges providing details of complaints received and redressed. 
These details also placed with the Stakeholders Relationship Committee and the Board on a quarterly basis, for their 
information.

Supply Chain Partners: The grievances are primarily registered and redressed through a dedicated vendor management 
platform called Partner portal for contractual and Whistleblowing Policy for other than contractual grievances. Partner 
portal captures the contractual grievances such as administrative and statutory compliances, payment, invoicing, 
contractual clauses, material and services schedule and delivery, quality non-conformances, global geo-political concerns 
beyond the contract but affecting contract performance. Typically, in most cases, based on the priority, complexity 
and severity of the grievance, the resolution time may range from 30-45 working days. In cases of major disputes, the 
resolution time may be more than 45 days. The entire process entails continuous dialogue and feedback. For grievances 
other than contractual, the Company has formulated Whistleblower Policy for Vendors & Channel Partners with a view 
to provide a mechanism for vendors of the Company to express genuine concerns about unethical behaviour, improper 
practice, any misconduct, any violation of legal or regulatory requirements, actual or suspected fraud, without fear 
of punishment or unfair treatment. The Policy was also circulated to all registered vendors across the Company and is 
available at https://www.larsentoubro.com/corporate/about-lt-group/corporate-policies/ 
	
The grievance redressal mechanism for employees and workers, community and customers are explained in Principle 3, 8 
and 9 respectively.
26.	 Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues. Please indicate material responsible 
business conduct and sustainability issues pertaining to environmental and social matters that present a risk 
or an opportunity to your business, rationale for identifying the same, approach to adapt or mitigate the risk 
along-with its financial implications, as per the following format 
	
The Company conducts materiality assessment to identify and prioritize the key material topics pertaining to ESG and 
understand the relative importance of these topics to the stakeholders and businesses. In FY 2021-22, the Company 
engaged with a diverse set of internal and external stakeholders to update its materiality matrix. The material topics, if 
addressed and strengthened can become a strength and if not, can pose a risk. For certain material topics, the focus is 
more on the potential risk and the approach taken by the Company to ensure that the risk does not materialize. This is 
outlined in the table in ‘Understanding Materiality’ section of Integrated Annual Report FY 2023-24.

5 The target was to impact 1.6 million beneficiaries by FY 2025-26. Since, the Company already attained its FY 2025-26 target during FY 2023-24, the 
target has been pushed further and the new target is to impact 1.7 million beneficiaries by FY 2025-26.
Renewable energy (% of total electricity) is significantly lower than the short-term target due to the challenges faced in 
sourcing renewable energy by the Company.  Issues faced for sourcing at project sites are unavailability of adequate area for 
installing solar modules, difficulties in getting green open access for temporary connections,  developers’ preference for long 
term power purchase agreements (10-15 years) and varying regulations and charges across the states.
Governance, leadership and oversight
7.	
Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, 
targets and achievements.
	
L&T is progressing on various dimensions of ESG by strengthening policies and processes, improving systems, translating 
plans into action towards achieving targets, continuous monitoring and review and building capacity of the workforce 
through various channels.
	
The Company has committed to achieve Carbon Neutrality by 2040 and Water Neutrality by 2035, and in-line with long 
term targets, the Company has taken interim targets up to FY 2025-26. The Company’s overall GHG emission intensity 
reduced by 12.2% in FY 2023-24 (7.8 tCO2e/¢ Cr in FY 2023-24 compared to 8.9 tCO2e/¢ Cr of the previous FY 2022-23) 
and this is in line with the reduction path up to FY 2025-26. Reduction in emission intensity was primarily driven by 
decrease in energy intensity by 15.9% in FY 2023-24. Emissions reduction would have been higher, had it not been for 
the challenges faced in increasing sourcing of renewable power, which stood at 9.2% (of electricity consumption) during 
the year. 
	
The Company’s strategy towards achieving Carbon Neutrality is based on two key pillars – reducing fossil fuel 
consumption and increasing use of renewable energy in electricity consumption. With more than 700 sites, EPC projects 
present significant challenges in implementing these strategies owing to their temporary operations (typically 3-4 years) 
at any project site, open boundaries, and extensive spatial coverage, especially in the context of linear projects. The 
business units of the Company have identified and are implementing several initiatives to progress towards the targets. 
Furthermore, the Company has formed two high-level taskforces during the year to help increase renewable electricity 
sourcing and reduce diesel consumption. 
	
Biodiversity promotion is another vital area and the Company has set a target of 1.5-2 million saplings per annum. 
During the year, the Company planted around 4 million saplings through large scale plantation drives across the country. 
In recent past, the Company had planted 150 hectares of mangroves near the A. M. Naik Heavy Engineering Complex, 
Hazira, Surat in Gujarat, which continue to protect coastal villages from incursion of salt water and facilitate storage of 
blue carbon. The Company is exploring different options for tracking survival and growth of saplings.

The Company is focusing on reducing water consumption intensity for achieving Water Neutrality. This is driven through 
initiatives such as water use efficiency, recycling of wastewater, rainwater harvesting and use of treated wastewater from 
municipal corporations. The Company also undertakes significant water conservation and ground water recharge through 
projects under the Company’s CSR programmes across different locations of the country. The Company has initiated steps 
for a third-party assessment to estimate the positive impact of these CSR initiatives. 
	
Recognizing the importance of Circular Economy on the businesses and the environment, the Company is taking 
numerous steps, including use of recycled or non-virgin material. In FY 2023-24, approximately 32% of input material 
was eco-friendly and non-virgin material. L&T Construction Research and Testing Centre (LTCRTC) in Chennai, which is 
recognized by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) and accredited by the National Accreditation 
Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL), continues to experiment with new material for replacing traditional 
material used in construction work. In FY 2023-24, Research & Testing Centre has achieved some encouraging results 
with design of mixes with low embodied carbon materials e.g., glass fibre textiles and with use of industrial by-products 
e.g., steel slag. (Further details are provided in Intellectual Capital section of the Integrated Annual Report FY 2023-24.)
	
During the year, the Company has taken substantial effort and actions to handhold and build awareness of the supply 
chain partners on ESG. The Company has started assessing its supply chain partners on ESG parameters starting with 25 
in FY 2022-23 and 200 in FY 2023-24. The assessment in the coming years will be more comprehensive and structured 
for improving ESG orientation as well as performance of the suppliers. 
	
The Company had set a target to achieve 40% of total revenue from Green Business by FY 2025-26 and has already 
exceeded by achieving 50% in FY 2023-24. Green Business is centred around clean mobility, clean energy, water and 
sanitation infrastructure and other related areas. The Company has been ranked third globally in ‘Top 200 Environmental 
Firms’ list consecutively in 2022 and 2023 by Engineering News Record (ENR), a reputed publication for the construction 
industry worldwide. 
	
The Company is focussed on providing equal opportunity, ensuring diversity and inclusion, safe workplace and 
wellbeing of its workforce. The Company has implemented multiple initiatives for safeguarding their health and safety. 
Skill upgradation as well as developing capabilities of the workforce for the future is a continuous thrust area for the 
Company. During the year, around 24,000 employees and 3,50,000 contract workmen have undergone training on 
health and safety. Several new initiatives were rolled out during FY 2023-24 to instil a high-performance work culture. 
For example, the Company launched Project NEEV (Nurture, Educate, Empower to create Value) to inculcate a culture of 
effective performance and continuous feedback.
	
The gender diversity stands at 8.1% with a target to reach 10% by FY 2025-26. Over the last two years, the Company 
has maintained hiring of 30% women Graduate Engineer Trainee (GET) and Post Graduate Engineer Trainee (PGET) and 
is continuously ramping up the efforts towards diverse and inclusive workplace. Various campaigns were organized, 
celebrating PRIDE month and people with different abilities, to increase awareness on diversity beyond gender. With the 
intention of developing a pipeline of women leaders, 495 women employees were handpicked to participate in WINSPIRE 
series of Leadership Development Programs during the last few years, with a 142% rise in participation rate.
	
Corporate Social Responsibility has been a primary focus of the Company, much before it became part of the legislation. 
The overarching theme for our CSR programme is to develop India’s Social Infrastructure by focusing on water and 
sanitation, education, health and skill building. In FY 2023-24, CSR initiatives impacted 1.6 million lives, with a target to 
reach 1.7 million beneficiaries by FY 2025-26. The Company’s Integrated Community Development Programmes (ICDP) 
initiated 10 years ago, helps in building resilience in rural communities, especially in remote water-scarce locations of 
Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan covering an area of ~43,091 hectares. The Company is scaling up and replicating 
these models in other locations. In all ICDP locations, the water table has risen by an average of 8 meters from the 
baseline benefitting nearly 25,000 households. Through these consistent efforts, the Company aims to improve quality 
of life, reduce social inequalities, promote self-sufficiency, and empower individuals in vulnerable and marginalised 
communities.
	
The Company is striving to ensure sustainable and inclusive growth. The Company believes in taking a balanced approach 
for creating enduring long-term value for its multiple stakeholders – customers, suppliers, business partners, shareholders, 
community, the society, and the planet. The Company is pursuing the path of purposeful progress with enthusiasm and 
optimism.

training before entering the project site/plant/any other location. Safety related trainings are not covered in the table 
above. For details of trainings provided to the workers, refer to Q1 of this Principle.
	
b)	
Sustainability and Responsible Business Practices: In FY 2023-24, the Company scaled up its awareness and 
training programmes for its supply chain partners on sustainability. Three online sessions were targeting the top 
500 supply chain partners and around 410 participants joined these sessions. A two-hour module has been created 
covering topics such as fundamentals of sustainability, emerging regulatory landscape, BRSR principles, how the 
Company is incorporating sustainability in supply chain, ESG assessment being conducted by the Company and lastly, 
preparedness for the forthcoming years. Additionally, during ESG assessment conducted for the top 200 supply chain 
partners, handholding sessions were conducted to align them with the purpose, parameters, evidence required to 
complete the assessment.

Does the entity have processes in place to avoid/ manage conflict of interests involving members of the 
Board? (Yes/No). If Yes, provide details of the same.
	
The Company has processes for management of conflicts of interests involving members of the Board which may arise 
due to Directors joining the Boards of other companies, and even conflicts which could take place during normal business 
activities. The process allows the Directors to recuse themselves from the discussions pertaining to the conflict of interest. 
The Directors must exercise their responsibilities in a bona fide manner in the interests of the Company. They should not 
allow any extraneous considerations that may vitiate their exercise of objective independent judgment in the paramount 
interest of the Company and not abuse their position to the detriment of the Company for the purpose of gaining direct 
or indirect personal advantage. Any conflict of interest arising with the Board Members needs to be reported to the 
Chairman of the Audit Committee/Chairman of the Board.
Principle 2: Businesses should provide goods and services in a manner that is sustainable and safe

Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No) 
	
	
L&T is committed to incorporating sustainability that encompasses its supply chain partners viz. vendors, contractors, 
service providers and distributors through a dedicated Green Supply Chain Policy and its Code of Conduct. 
Furthermore, L&T expects and urges its suppliers to introduce suitable processes, functions and management systems 
within their organisations that support such compliance and drive continuous improvement with regards to the 
requirements included in the Code of Conduct. This Code of Conduct guides all supply chain partners to engage in 
ethical, responsible and legal business practices in their operations and adhere to ESG standards. L&T expects the 
suppliers to comply with all applicable regulatory requirements and implement policies and procedures, and provide 
training, as deemed necessary within their organisation. The Code of Conduct is built on three pillars:
	
	
A.	 Promote Environmental Sustainability: All suppliers to support a precautionary approach to environmental 
issues and undertake initiatives to promote better environmental responsibility.
	
	
B.	
Commitment to Human Rights, Labour and the Society: Suppliers to support, respect and protect human 
and labour rights and make sure their organisation/entity is not complicit in any kind of abuses and/or violations.
	
	
C.	 Ethical Integrity and Legality: Suppliers to demonstrate the highest standard of integrity, ethics and business 
conduct.

The Company has adopted various methodologies for sustainable sourcing. Some are stated below:
	
	
•	
The supply chain partners were evaluated for sustainable sourcing wherein the Company checked their 
adherence to ISO 14001:2015, 45001:2018, SA8000 and any other related standards and frameworks.
	
	
•	
It is mandatory for supply chain partners to acknowledge the clauses and sign the Code of Conduct of 
Company, which includes commitment to environmental protection and conservation such as reduction of 
resource consumption, waste generation, pollution prevention; social aspects such as commitment to human 
rights, community engagement, ethics and various governance parameters. This is a mandatory step during 
vendor registration and onboarding process.
	
	
•	
The Company has also started assessing its supply chain partners on ESG parameters. It was initiated in 
FY 2022-23 with 25 partners and scaled up to top 200 (186 unique) in FY 2023-24. The assessment is based on 
the response and evidence provided to the Company on parameters related to the environment, human rights, 
CSR, health, safety and governance.
	
	
•	
Three awareness sessions were conducted targeting the top 500 supply chain partners during the year to orient 
them towards ESG requirements and expectation of the Company.
	
	
The assessment in the coming years will be more comprehensive and structured for improving ESG orientation as 
well as the performance of the suppliers. Additionally, the awareness sessions will also be ramped up to bring the 
partners up to speed keeping in mind the increased scrutiny and regulatory requirements on the subject. The overall 
governance, oversight and review of the supply chain initiatives is undertaken by Material Council along with the 
supply chain management functions led by senior leadership and supported by Corporate Sustainability. 
	
b.	
If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?
	
	
Accounts for 32% of L&T procurement spend by value.

(c)	 Hazardous waste: NA
	
(d)	 Other waste: NA
	
The Company does not manufacture or sells any products which could be reclaimed at the end of life. However, at project 
sites and manufacturing facilities, the Company has put in place systems and processes for waste management i.e., 
segregation, recycling, reuse and disposal as applicable for category of waste and complying to the relevant regulatory 
requirements.
4.	
Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes/No). If yes, whether 
the waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to Pollution 
Control Boards? If not, provide steps taken to address the same. 
	
Yes, in 2022, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) made amendments to EPR Rules related 
to plastic waste, e-waste and battery waste. As a result, the coverage of the Rules was extended to importers who 
could generate plastic waste from packaging of imported materials, e-waste which could be generated from imported 
electronic or electrical items as well as battery waste which could be generated from imported batteries or equipment 
containing batteries. The Company has obtained registration as an importer under the EPR Rules for all three waste 
categories. To comply with EPR Rules as well as to improve the waste management system, the Company has improved 
its processes including conducting awareness sessions for the relevant departments/functions and onboarded service 
providers for meeting compliance requirement.

Yes
Registration and redressal are done through Union and standing orders/Joint Management Council/

During the year, the redressal mechanism has been more formalized and structured especially for the 
construction business. Any grievance may be raised by the worker oneself or on behalf of the group. It 
may be related to working conditions, living conditions at the workmen habitat/labour colony, wage-
related issues or any other issues related to their employment.
Any project location/establishments with 20 or more workers should have a Grievance Redressal 
Officer (GRO), appointed by the Project Manager from any of the personnel from the functions (Project 
Accounts and Admin In charge, Project Safety In charge) and communicated to the relevant stakeholders 
(Admin/Industrial Relations/Accounts head). The mechanism includes registration of grievance, 
resolution, timeline for resolution, escalation, feedback and closure, record-keeping and reporting and 
periodic review and audits.

If Yes, then give details of the mechanism in brief
Over 500 GROs have been appointed across project sites to ensure grievance registering, resolving, 
meeting timelines, managing escalations, closing cases, generating reports, and facilitating regular 
reviews and audits in a systematic way. Grievance may cover issues related to health and safety, working 
conditions, wages, living conditions, and so on. A toll-free number is available for recording grievances 
of the workers, operational 24x7 over and above the oral and/or written complaints which were already 
being recorded. This provides a fair and transparent process for resolving complaints and ensuring equal 
and fair treatment.
Permanent 
Employees
Yes
The digital platform HEERA serves as the primary channel for addressing employee grievances. The 
grievances may be related to concerns regarding work, working relation, workplace and working 
conditions, salary-related matters, disputes related to claims settlement, reimbursement, and recovery of 
dues and leaves, issues pertaining medical insurance and policy, inconsistencies in policy implementation, 
violation of Code of Conduct, miscellaneous issues such as system portal functionality or any other issue 
affecting the employment of an employee. 
Grievances should first be addressed by employees with their Immediate Supervisor seeking resolution. 
In the absence of an assigned Immediate Supervisor, employees may escalate the matter to the next level 
supervisor. If the employee remains dissatisfied then alternately, they can initiate a grievance ticket via 
HEERA chatbot. The designated HR officer is responsible for resolution of the grievance and based on 
the severity and complexity, the timelines and escalation (with a maximum of three level) may vary.
Other than 
Permanent 
Employees
Yes
Grievances are submitted to respective HR coordinators who are responsible for resolution.

work locations are required to undertake to implement the EHS risk management as an integral part of their business 
operations. EHS risk management process covers five steps: hazard identification, risk evaluation and assessment, 
risk mitigation and control measures, monitoring and documentation, and periodic reporting and update. Hazard 
identification and risk assessment is one of the crucial processes followed across work locations. The relevant 
stakeholders including construction engineers, design and planning engineers, production-in-charge personnel and 
EHS team members as well as workmen are involved in the risk assessment and risk management process. Safe Work 
Method Statements, as relevant for processes, have been developed and deployed prior to the start of any work.

*Mission Zero Harm is the guiding principle for the Company with respect to safety performance, and it is extremely unfortunate to report an 
increase in fatalities in FY 2023-24 (13 in FY 2022-23). The Company has taken this as a matter of significant concern and all the incidents were 
investigated in depth.  Key reasons which contributed to the increase were poor strength of supporting structure resulting in cave-ins/landslides 
and inadequate safety protocols while working at heights. The issue has been compounded by significant jump in number of contract workmen, 
and high degree of churn. The Company has taken corrective actions such as enhanced supervision, more intensive toolbox talks, different 
coloured helmets for newly inducted workers, expert consultation for high-risk activities (specially for remote areas), more engagement with larger 
subcontractors. The Company is fully committed to improving safety performance and ensuring a safer workplace.
12.	 Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy work place. 
	
The Company is committed to ensuring that all employees and workers are working in a safe environment and have 
the necessary support to lead a healthy life. EHS, HR, Admin and Medical teams are the key functions undertaking 
initiatives on a continuous basis to ensure all needs for a safe and healthy workplace are met. Safety is a priority for 
the Management due to nature of the business i.e., projects executed with use of substantial involvement of workers 
and encapsulated in L&T’s Mission Zero Harm as well as driving force behind L&T’s L.I.F.E. (Live Injury-Free Everyday) 
Framework. The Management provides strong, demonstrable, and visible leadership and commitment towards 
implementation of this framework through allocation of adequate resources, assigning responsibilities and through 
personal examples and actions. As a part of the EHS Management System, each project site is required to prepare a 
project specific EHS plan before commencing the execution. This plan identifies the hazardous operations in the scope 
of work, assesses risks from such hazards and management of risks through proactive measures and controls. Similar 
process is followed for the manufacturing facilities/campuses. To strengthen the processes and systems, internal audits are 
conducted at various levels both by the businesses themselves as well as inter-businesses and external audits are carried 
out through accredited third-party agencies. For certain high importance/priority project sites, frequency and depth of 
audit is increased depending on the risk profile of such projects. Digital systems/applications play a significant role in 
identifying hazards as well as enabling capturing of risks as well as learnings from execution. Use of advanced technology 
such as vison analytics/AI in enhancing these applications. Digital technologies e.g., AR/VR are also leveraged to enhance 
training and awareness of employees and workers. To enhance the standard practices recommended, the Company 
has taken other measures which include Implementation of HSE Surveillance Rating, Knowledge management through 
capturing of lessons learnt and special sessions by SMEs (Subject Matter Experts), Implementation of Behaviour Based 
Safety systems, and specialized training modules for high-risk activities. 11 project teams of the Company demonstrated 
the strong commitment to EHS management and performance by winning the coveted Sword of Honour by British Safety 
Council.

and social topics (Yes/No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders 
on these topics were incorporated into policies and activities of the entity. 
	
The Company continuously engages with its stakeholders to strengthen relationships, foster trust and thus enable 
the Company to be informed of their expectations, concerns as well as opportunities for value creation. A structured 
approach and process is in place for engaging with the stakeholders for identifying, prioritising and addressing their 
needs and concerns in a consistent and systematic manner. Below are a few instances of how stakeholder inputs have 
been incorporated into policies and activities:
	
A.	 Communities: CSR projects are chosen based on social and developmental needs in the regions where the Company 
is operating, with the overall goal of promoting inclusive growth by empowering communities and accelerating 
development especially the vulnerable and marginalized communities. This is being accomplished by providing 
access to water and sanitation facilities, education and healthcare services, and skill building for underprivileged 
youth. L&T works along with the communities around its factories, campuses and establishments for health and 
education services. Water-stressed blocks are selected for water and sanitation projects. Skills development centres 
are located across India to mobilize youth from different states. The Company may partner with the government and 
communities to create multiplier effect of its social programmes. The mode of implementation of CSR programmes 
will include a combination of direct implementation and/or through partners such as NGOs, trusts, academic 
institutions, business associates, registered societies.
	
	
After identifying a location, a need assessment is conducted, and a detailed project report is prepared. The project 
report specifies socio economic status of the location viz. number of villages or urban slum pockets, number of 
students or trainees, the schools/households to be covered, current facilities, and specific vulnerable community 
groups such as the SC/ST population and their needs and concerns. The need assessment involves participatory rural 
appraisal (PRA), wherein beneficiaries participate in identifying specific issues, vulnerable populations, stakeholders, 
and potential challenges in implementing the interventions. The project report includes proposed interventions, 
Business Responsibility & 
Sustainability Reporting

268
outcomes and measurable indicators. Based on the project report, proposals are invited from reputed NGOs with a 
presence in the selected location and the implementation partner is carefully selected after thorough due diligence. 
	
	
During implementation, stakeholder groups are formed, such as Self-Help Groups, Village Development Committees, 
School Management Committees, and Health Committees, to participate in decision-making and implementation. 
These groups guide and monitor the interventions at the community level, such as monitoring the use of water from 
a common source created by the project, regulating the use of water under the water distribution system, measuring 
and recording water levels in intervention wells, encouraging communities to use household toilets, and monitoring 
and regulating the use of common pasture lands. There is continuous dialogue between the implementation 
partners, communities and CSR teams to ensure clear understanding of the issues the communities face and the 
possible solutions. The initiatives are re-aligned, if the need be, for the best interests of the community.
	
	
For details of CSR intervention, please refer to ‘Social and Relationship Capital’ section of the Integrated Annual 
Report FY 2023-24.
	
B.	
Employees and Workmen: There are structured systems for employee communication and engagement that starts 
from project director/business heads/senior management visits and interactions with employees, HR manager visits 
and townhalls are held from time-to-time for interactions with employees and the workers. There are Employee 
Relation Officers at the project sites and with support of the Workmen Development Centres, they oversee and 
interact, take workers’ feedback from time-to-time on various aspects of living, work conditions, health and welfare. 
Depending on the feedback received from the channels as stated above, including the survey findings, HR heads of 
individual businesses, with the support of their cluster/project HR managers, also undertake surveys as per the need 
on various topics related to employee development, engagement and effectiveness. The findings are discussed with 
project/business heads and corrective actions are taken to enhance the organisational effectiveness. Additionally, 
there are designated Grievance Redressal Officers (GRO), Industrial Relation, Admin functions who oversee the 
health, safety, wellbeing, working conditions, living conditions of the workmen. These GROs are also responsible 
for communication with all workers at the time of Screening/Induction/Onboarding and at regular intervals such 
as pep-talk about channels (toll free number, WhatsApp, verbal, registers) to raise grievances, and the mechanism 
for settlement of grievances and similar communication with the sub-contractors working at the project site. 
Remediation and corrective action are taken as deemed necessary to resolve the grievances.
	
C.	 Shareholders: In addition to its ongoing interactions with analysts representing institutional equity investors, the 
Company conducted an investor feedback survey to build into its long-term strategic plan - ‘Lakshya 2026’. As 
part of this exercise, several suggestions from key investors and analysts were received on ESG related aspects such 
as energy transition, diversity and inclusion, governance. The Company also received suggestions from ESG rating 
agencies and funds as well as improving granularity of ESG disclosures. This has resulted in improvement of processes 
wherever necessary and feasible. The quality and granularity of ESG disclosures have also enhanced in the past 
couple of years especially after the introduction of BRSR and Core KPIs. Recognising the growing interest in this area 
and factoring in feedback from investor interactions, the Company has been conducting regular interactions with 
relevant stakeholders including global funds, institutional investors, rating agencies, etc., to keep them updated 
about activities and progress on various initiatives being undertaken to achieve its carbon and water neutrality goals.

permanent workers across more than 700 project sites and locations within India and abroad. Wages to other than permanent workers 
are directly paid by the third party contractors. The Company monitors the wages and statutory compliances based on the wage register 
submitted by the third party contractors along with the monthly invoice at project site level manually. The Company is capturing the total 
payment made to contractors but the wages included therein is not tracked / collated separately. Going forward in the coming years, the 
Company will explore options to capture, track and report the wages paid to other than permanent workers.

Do you have a focal point (Individual/Committee) responsible for addressing human rights impacts or issues 
caused or contributed to by the business? (Yes/No) 
	
The Chief Human Resources Officer is the focal point for human rights related issues at the Company level. For 
implementation across the sites and manufacturing facilities, designated personnel from IR/Admin/EHS functions are 
responsible for human rights and labour management. At business level, IR/Admin Heads of respective businesses are the 
focal point supported by HR heads.
5.	
Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues.
	
Respect and commitment to human rights is one of the elements of the Code of Conduct for employees. As a practice, 
any violation of Code of Conduct can be reported to the 1st Level Reporting Authority, who will investigate and take 
necessary action. However, if the violation is by the 1st Level Reporting Authority itself, then it is to be reported to the 2nd 
Level Reporting Authority. In case the Reporting Authority concludes that the violation is of a grave nature, the same shall 
be reported to the Whistleblower Investigation Committee for further action within a reasonable time frame.
	
L&T is committed to foster and create a workplace which is safe and free from any act of sexual harassment. The Policy 
for protection of women’s rights at workplace has been formulated to guide the Company for redressal of sexual 
harassment related complaints. This Policy is based on the laws of India and therefore the Policy is applicable to all L&T 
establishments located in India including all employees, workmen, contract workers. This Policy also protects anyone 
visiting the establishments of the Company, that may include clients, customers, third party contractors, vendors, 
suppliers, business representatives. When sexual harassment has occurred because of an act of any third party, the 
Company takes necessary and reasonable steps to assist the affected person/victim. To adhere with the provisions of the 
Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (POSH Act) and ensure 
coverage across the locations in India, there are several Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) constituted as per the 
provision of the POSH Act with different administrative units under their jurisdiction. These ICCs are responsible for 
registering, investigating, concluding and redressing complaints received. Furthermore, the ICCs also organize workshops 
and awareness sessions at regular intervals and take necessary actions needed to implement the provisions of the 
Act. Additionally, two Apex Committees have also been constituted, the highest body to ensure implementation and 
compliance with the Act. The Apex Committees comprise representatives of few ICCs and other senior leaders of the 
Company. 
	
Whistleblowing is a structured process, which encourages and facilitates employees to report without fear, any 
wrongdoings or unethical or improper practice which may adversely impact the reputation and/or the financials of the 
Company, through an appropriate forum. The Company has also formulated Whistleblower Policy for its employees and

The Company has made improvements in FY 2023-24 for capturing data related to water withdrawal, consumption and 
discharge. However, the Company has more than 700 project sites in operation, and which are by definition temporary 
and with open boundaries. Water is taken from multiple sources, as per site conditions and discharged through multiple 
points. These issues create significant challenge in putting direct measurement systems and therefore, indirect estimation 
has to be made which presents difficulty in completeness and traceability of the data as required for reasonable assurance 
standards. To improve data collection and reporting, the Company is redesigning the Standard Operating Procedures 
(SOPs) which will be based on reasonable assurance requirements, and this will be rolled out to all the sites/locations. 
Additionally, the Company is finalizing the digital solutions which would enable direct measurement without manual 
intervention.

and traceability of the data as required for reasonable assurance standards. To improve data collection and reporting, 
the Company is redesigning the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) which will be based on reasonable assurance 
requirements, and this will be rolled out to all the sites/locations. Additionally, the Company is exploring some digital 
solutions which could be used to enable direct measurement without manual intervention.

10. 	Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy 
adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes 
and the practices adopted to manage such wastes. 
	
Waste management is an integral part of the EHS management system. Each location (project site, manufacturing 
facilities and campuses) has a location specific waste management plan, which is based on types of waste generated and 
applicable disposal methods. Waste management guidelines and procedures focus on Reduce, Reuse, Recycle principles 
and ensure proper waste identification, segregation, recycling (if applicable) and disposal. All businesses assess the 
waste generated from operations for reuse potential and after exhausting the feasible options, opt for relevant disposal 
methods. For hazardous waste, waste management is done complying to the requirements of applicable hazardous 
waste management rules e.g., Battery Waste Management Rules, 2022 and as per the guidelines issued by Central 
and State Pollution Control Boards. Hazardous waste is stored at specially designated areas/locations at project sites 
or manufacturing facilities and the disposal is done through govt approved/registered waste handling agencies. The 
Company also conducts regular training and awareness programmes on waste management for employees and workers 
focusing on waste minimization and proper waste handling. The Company also ensures suitable storage requirements 
e.g., fire-fighting equipment, spill kits, drip trays for safe storage of waste before disposal. The Company manufactures 
certain products which are meant for industrial and defence use and no hazardous or toxic chemicals are used in these 
products.

Initiatives undertaken
Details of the initiative (web-link, if any, may be provided 
along with summary)
Outcome of initiative
1
Reduction in Diesel 
Consumption through 
optimization initiatives
Construction Machinery, used at project sites, are typically 
powered by diesel. As part of cost optimization initiatives, all 
project teams constantly look for ways to maximize the utilization 
of these machinery as well as optimize the deployment. These 
initiatives are enabled through use of sensor-based technologies 
and digital tools.
Emissions avoided in 
FY 2023-24: 22,207 tCO2e
2
Reduction in Diesel 
Consumption by 
Switching to Grid 
electricity
Construction project sites have historically been powered by 
Diesel Generator sets due to remote locations as well as hurdles 
in getting the grid connection. The Company has taken initiatives 
across various project sites to get grid electricity connections and 
help reduce diesel consumption.
Emissions avoided in 
FY 2023-24: 12,952 tCO2e
3
Groundwater Recharge
In some underground metro projects, dewatering is required to 
enable proper working conditions. Typically, the water extracted 
in the dewatering process is sent to storm water drain. In CMRL 
TU02 project, site faced a challenge in not having proper facility 
for safe discharge of this water. The project team came up with 
a design to process the water from dewatering process and then 
feed it back to groundwater through recharge borewells. This 
enabled not only safe discharge of the water but also helped in 
replenishing the ground water.
~ 21 kL per day of dewatered 
quantity was sent to recharge 
wells. In FY 2023-24, the site 
was able to recharge ~3,520 kL 
of water.
4
Rainwater Harvesting
In MAHSR project, one section has implemented a large 
Rainwater Harvesting system. The facility was incorporated at 
design stage itself during construction of a temporary facility 
(Noise Barrier factory). Water conserved is stored in a storage 
tank for further use in site activities as well as provided to the 
community for irrigation and other uses.
~6,500 kL water was 
conserved, avoiding 
extraction from other sources. 
Additionally, the energy spent 
in sourcing water is also 
avoided.
5
C&D Waste Recycling
Concrete waste gets generated in civil works related to 
infrastructure projects. Typically, this is disposed through assigned 
agencies, and which use it typically for landfilling. Additionally, 
the concrete waste also consumes space at project site. In 
Kundankulam Nuclear Power Project, the project team established 
a crusher plant to process this concrete waste into aggregates 
of different sizes. This was reused in making solid blocks for 
construction as well as for aggregate use in workmen colony PCC 
works, infra works, fill-crete at site.
Concrete waste of ~160 tonnes 
was crushed and processed into 
aggregates of different sizes 
and thereby, avoiding sourcing 
of equivalent volume from 
other sources.
	
Other significant initiatives are covered in ‘Natural Capital’ and ‘Intellectual Capital’ sections of the Integrated Annual Report 
FY 2023-24.
5. 	 Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan? Give details in 100 words/web link. 
	
Disaster management is an important component of EHS management system. At the EPC Project sites and 
Manufacturing facilities/campuses, the Company has implemented disaster management and emergency preparedness 
plans (EPPs) that address emergencies such as flooding, earthquake, major fires, disease outbreaks etc. These plans are 
focussed on Mitigation, Preparedness, Response, Recovery to ensure minimal disruptions to the business operations 
in face of emergencies. Key locations are equipped with emergency sirens, first aid, medical treatment facilities, and 
identification of assembly points. To maintain a high level of preparedness, relevant training, and capacity-building 
programmes, including mock drills, are undertaken for employees and workers. Disaster management plans are readily 
available and easily accessible to all relevant stakeholders, including contractors and emergency services personnel.

practitioners, environmental engineers, and specialists. 
 
2.
Identified Sustainability Information  
 
Our scope of reasonable assurance consists of the BRSR Core indicators listed in the Appendix I to our report. The reporting

2/P/CIR/2023/122 dated July 12, 2023, and its clarifications thereto and have the required competencies and experience 
to conduct this assurance engagement. 
 
We apply Standard on Quality Control (the “SQC”) 1, “Quality Control for Firms that Perform Audits and Reviews of 
Historical Financial Information, and Other Assurance and Related Services Engagements”, and accordingly maintain a 
comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical 
requirements, professional standards, and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. 
 
7.
Our Responsibility  
 
Our responsibility is to express a reasonable assurance opinion on the Identified Sustainability Information listed in 
Appendix I based on the procedures we have performed and evidence we have obtained.  
 
We conducted our engagement in accordance with the Standard on Sustainability Assurance Engagements (SSAE) 3000, 
“Assurance Engagements on Sustainability Information”, and Standard on Assurance Engagements (SAE) 3410 Assurance 
Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements (together the “Standards”), both issued by the Sustainability Reporting 
Standards Board (the “SRSB") of the ICAI. 
 
These Standards require that we plan and perform our engagement to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
Identified Sustainability Information listed in Appendix I and included in the Report are prepared, in all material respects, 
in accordance with the Criteria stated under paragraph 3 above. 
 
As part of reasonable assurance engagement in accordance with the Standards, we exercise professional judgment and 
maintain professional skepticism throughout the engagement. 
 
8.
Reasonable Assurance  
 
A reasonable assurance engagement involves identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the Identified 
Sustainability Information whether due to fraud or error, responding to the assessed risks as necessary in the 
circumstances. 
 
The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment and included inquiries, observation of processes 
performed, inspection of documents, evaluating the appropriateness of quantification methods and reporting policies, 
analytical procedures and agreeing or reconciling with underlying records. 
 
Given the circumstances of the engagement, in performing the procedures listed above, we:  
 
•
Obtained an understanding of the Identified Sustainability Information and related disclosures; 
•
Obtained an understanding of the assessment criteria and their suitability for the evaluation and/or measurements 
of the Identified Sustainability Information; 
•
Made inquiries of Company’s management, including sustainability team, compliance team, human resource team 
amongst others and those with the responsibility for preparation of the Report; 
•
Obtained an understanding and performed an evaluation of the design of the key systems, processes and controls for 
recording, processing and reporting on the Identified Sustainability Information at the corporate office and at other 
project locations/offices on a sample basis. This included evaluating the design of those controls relevant to the 
Reasonable Assurance Report
Integrated Annual Report 2023-24
290
 
engagement and determining whether they have been implemented by performing procedures in addition to inquiry 
of the personnel responsible for the Identified Sustainability Information; 
•
Based on the above understanding and the risks that the Identified Sustainability Information may be materially 
misstated, determined the nature, timing and extent of further procedures; 
•
Tested the Company’s process for collating the sustainability information through agreeing or reconciling the 
Identified Sustainability Information with the underlying records on a sample basis; and  
•
Tested the consolidation for project locations/offices on a sample basis and corporate office under the reporting 
boundary for ensuring the completeness of data being reported. 
 
We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our reasonable 
assurance opinion. 
 
9.
Exclusions  
 
Our assurance scope excludes the following and therefore we do not express an opinion on:  
 
•
Aspects of the Reports and the data/information (qualitative or quantitative) other than the Identified Sustainability 
Information; and 
•
The statements that describe expression of opinion, belief, aspiration, expectation, aim, or future intentions provided 
by the Company. 
 
10. Other information 
 
The Company’s Management is responsible for the Other information. The Other information comprises the information 
included within the BRSR and the IAR, other than Identified Sustainability Information and our independent assurance 
report dated June 06, 2024 thereon. 
 
Our opinion on the Identified Sustainability Information does not cover the Other information and we do not express any 
form of assurance thereon. 
 
In connection with our assurance engagement of the Identified Sustainability Information, our responsibility is to read the 
Other information and, in doing so, consider whether the Other information is materially inconsistent with the Identified 
Sustainability Information or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
 
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this Other information, 
we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. 
 
11. Basis for Qualified Opinion 
 
•
As described in the Note to BRSR Section C ‘Principle 6 “Business should respect and make efforts to protect and 
restore the environment” – Essential Indicator 3 and 4 “Details related to Water” and Essential Indicator 9 “ Details 
related to Waste Management ” of the Report, the Company has used indirect estimation instead of the approach 
provided under the BRSR guidance note to determine complete and accurate disclosures for “Details related to Water 
” and “Details related to Waste Management” indicators. In the absence of sufficient appropriate evidence to check 
the completeness and accuracy of the values disclosed under “Details related to Water ” and “Details related to Waste 
Management” as at and for the year ended March 31, 2024, we were unable to determine whether any adjustments 
to the reported figures with respect to “Details related to Water ” and “ Details related to Waste Management” were 
necessary or not as at and for the year ended March 31, 2024.
