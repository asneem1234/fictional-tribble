Ethics 
and Anti- 
Corruption 
Risk
1.	 We have ensured strong ethical business 
culture and undertaken measures to have 
effective risk management such as a Board 
approved Risk Management Framework and 
the Risk Management Process.
2.	 Important in enhancing long-term value 
creation with stakeholders.

Human Rights 
Practices 
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: The absence of a comprehensive Human 
Rights governance structure from the aspects of 
parameters such as working conditions, child/ 
forced labor, fair remuneration, gender diversity, 
prevention of sexual harassment, freedom 
of association and collective bargaining will 
impact the Company’s performance in the social 
domain from the perspective of the employee 
workforce as well as the community.
Opportunity: The presence of a Code of 
Conduct and a strong redressal mechanism 
outlines the Company’s commitment to Human 
Rights protection
The Company remains committed 
to respecting and protecting Human 
Rights. The Company’s Code of 
Business Conduct & Ethics and the 
Human Resource Practices cover 
most of these aspects. The Company 
does not hire child labor, forced 
labor, or involuntary labor. The 
Company treats all its employees at 
parity.
Positive: Comprehensive 
alignment of Human Rights 
principles in accordance 
with the guiding principles

Risk 
Management
Risk
Risk: Lack of robust controls across the risk 
management system may lead to adverse 
impacts across business operations.
The Board of Directors of the 
Company has constituted a Risk 
Management Committee (“RMC”) 
consisting of members of the Board 
of the Company. The RMC has been 
entrusted with the responsibility 
to monitor and review the Risk 
Management Plan for the Company.
The composition of the Committee 
complies with Regulation 21 
of SEBI (Listing Obligations 
and Disclosure Requirements) 
Regulations, 2015, and the detailed 
composition is provided in the 
Corporate Governance Report 
forming part of Annual Report. The 
Company has a Risk Management 
framework to identify and evaluate 
internal and external risks faced 
by your Company. This framework 
defines risk identification and its 
management across the enterprise 
covering various functions 
including documentation and 
reporting. Under each areas of risk, 
various parameters are identified, 
benchmarked and scored under 
three risk quotients, viz., high, 
medium and low. The Risk quotient 
for most of the parameters so 
identified is tracked on a half-
yearly/annual basis, to gauge the 
performance.
The framework so monitored helps 
in understanding prevailing risk 
trends, exposure and potential 
impact analysis of various risks on 
the Company’s business to minimize 
the adverse impact, if any, of any 
type of Risk.
Positive: Compliance 
with relevant regulatory 
requirements pertaining to 
the rating domain reflects the 
Company’s commitment to 
responsible business practices.
Negative: Noncompliance with 
the regulatory requirements, 
may affect the Company’s 
image and impact its business 
continuity in the long term.

Employee 
Practices and 
Benefits 
Risk and 
Opportunity 
Risk: Talent management parameters such as 
acquisition, retention and development are 
intrinsically linked to workforce welfare. The 
inability to meet the workforce expectations 
may impact the Company’s retention rate and 
affect the Company’s business continuity due to 
the criticality of the workforce as a part of the 
business’s growth plan.
Opportunity: The company’s efforts towards 
workforce welfare and development directly 
conveys its resolute commitment towards the 
upliftment of the most integral asset.
Employees are the main asset of 
the company as the business of 
credit rating is based on knowledge 
which is manifested in the skills 
of the employees. The Company 
hires its staff at both, lateral and 
entry-level based on requirement 
and merit. As the focus is on merit 
the Company is agnostic to the 
background and hence is an equal 
opportunity employer for potential 
candidates. Once recruited, the 
employees are put through internal 
training and given a open learning 
environment which helps in personal 
development.
Higher levels of responsibility are 
allocated to deserving employees 
while a career path is chalked 
out for everyone. When required, 
lateral recruitment takes place so 
that there is continuity and there 
is never a shortfall of leadership at 
various levels. Besides competitive 
remuneration, the Company offers 
several employee engagement 
activities that foster team building, 
celebrating functions, wedding gifts, 
cash gifts on Diwali, organizing 
games, Annual health check-up, 
Comprehensive health insurance 
programs such as Mediclaim, 
Personal Accident and Term Life 
Insurance, Education support, etc. 
are all part of this process. The 
company also offers a flexible work-
from-home policy for those who 
require such a facility.
Positive: A strong workforce 
with a high retention rate 
highlight the Company’s efforts 
towards creating a conducive 
work environment in addition 
to creating a positive approach 
towards workforce development
Negative: The workforce being 
an integral component of the 
Company’s value creation 
strategy plays a critical role in 
the business growth plan. The 
inability to meet the workforce 
expectations may result in 
adverse impacts on workforce 
productivity and the company’s 
growth plan in the long run.

“Medium Risk”. Weekly tracking for the Analytics business by the CRO with 
the Talent Acquisition Team and on a bi-weekly basis with the ED-BD and the 
Talent Acquisition Team. Self-tracking by HR additionally helps to ensure that we 
mitigate this key business risk
•

There is a notable growth in the businesses of the company as well as the 
subsidiaries as they’re bringing in top clients for the purpose of expansion in new 
markets with appropriate products. There has been a surge in accountability towards 
ESG in the coming years. It provides an opportunity to create a more sustainable 
business which will act as a key determinative for improving relevancy and trust 
among the organization’s stakeholders. The company’s operating philosophy has 
always considered social and environmental responsibility. Hence, the company’s 
CSR initiatives have created a deep relationship which is further reflected in 
the communities with whom the company engages with. We were involved in 
multiple initiatives in the field of education, provision of health facilities, local area 
development & provision of livelihood of the underprivileged.
We engage with our employees to provide challenging, inclusive, dynamic and 
diverse work environment that leads to their professional development and also 
promotes good work-life balance. This helps to improve the overall health and 
wellness of employees. The company promotes strong administration, transparency 
and risk management at all levels of our organization. This has helped guarantee 
long-term preservation of value for our business.

Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders 
and the Board on economic, environmental, and social topics 
or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such 
consultations provided to the Board.
The stakeholder engagement and materiality 
assessment conducted during FY23 
resulted in the prioritization of key issues, 
mapping out the corresponding risks 
for each significant topic, and devising 
subsequent risk mitigation measures. 
The primary outcome of the stakeholder 
engagement exercise was the identification 
and prioritization of material issues pertinent 
to environmental, social, governance, and 
economic aspects. The identified material 
issues were presented to the highest 
governing member and the Board for their 
feedback and guidance on strategizing the 
company’s sustainable growth model. As part 
of our ongoing commitment to engaging 
with both internal and external stakeholder 
groups to identify key material issues 
affecting them, the stakeholder engagement 
exercise undergoes periodic review. 
Our objective is to create value for all 
our stakeholders. Our key stakeholders 
include employees, customers, partners and 
vendors, Government and regulatory bodies, 
as well as the community. We engage 
with these groups to understand their 
perspectives and address their requirements 
effectively. These ongoing engagements 
help us identify and monitor key economic, 
environmental, and social trends that can 
be incorporated into our overall business 
strategy. At the Company, the stakeholder 
engagement mechanism is a key driving 
force towards strengthening and broadening 
the stakeholder relationship, thereby aiding 
in the identification of key material issues 
impacting the Company’s growth.

identification and management of environmental, and social 
topics (Yes / No).

inputs whilst planning our goals & targets 
in areas of E-S-G. Ethics, human rights,

companies have on the environment when doing our 
ratings assignments. The considerations with respect 
to Environment, Social and Governance aspects are an 
integral part of assessing credit risk and get addressed 
under various parameters in our sector methodologies, 
wherever relevant. For example, Environmental risk 
is a concern for polluting sectors like Chemicals and 
the Company would look at mitigation in the form 
of pollution control certifications, effluent treatment 
measures, etc. as part of the assessments done for 
arriving at the credit ratings.

platforms to streamline 
processes and reduce 
paper consumption 
across all offices
Across all our offices, numerous processes previously 
reliant on manual documentation across various 
organizational functions have been transitioned to 
IT platforms to curtail paper usage. This shift has 
significantly reduced paper footprints, particularly 
among key members of the analytical and business 
teams who historically printed notes and circulated 
documents.
