1.
Energy 
Management
Risk
Energy is crucial for the Company 
in 
the 
aerospace 
and 
Defence 
manufacturing sector, with electricity 
being the primary expense, followed 
by purchased fuels. The specific energy 
sources, 
consumption 
levels, 
and 
management strategies vary based on 
the products manufactured. The energy 
mix, 
including 
on-site 
generation, 
grid electricity, and alternative energy, 
affects the cost and reliability of the 
energy supply. Consequently, this can 
influence the Company’s cost structure 
and is an operational risk.
The Company recognizes the criticality 
of 
energy 
management 
in 
the 
aerospace and defence manufacturing 
sector, where electricity is the primary 
expense followed by purchased fuels. 
To address this, the Company is striving 
to manage its energy consumption 
effectively and reduce its environmental 
footprint. Efforts include planting trees, 
optimizing air conditioning usage, and 
exploring alternative energy sources 
to ensure a reliable and cost-effective 
energy supply. These initiatives are part 
of the Company’s broader strategy to 
mitigate operational risks. 
Negative
* There was no 
negative financial 
impact 
in 
the 
reporting 
period 
of FY 23-24.
2.
Hazardous 
Waste 
Management
Risk
Manufacturing aerospace and Defence 
products 
can 
produce 
hazardous 
process waste, such as heavy metals 
and wastewater treatment sludge. 
Companies encounter regulatory and 
operational challenges in managing this 
waste, as certain types are regulated 
for transport, treatment, storage, and 
disposal. 
Adopting effective waste management 
strategies with minimal environmental 
impact is the key to mitigate this risk. 
Waste treatment, disposal, recycling 
and / or recovery activities, while initially 
requiring 
investment 
or 
operating 
costs, can lower an entity’s long-term 
cost structure and reduce the risk of 
remediation liabilities or regulatory 
penalties. At DCX, hazardous waste 
is carefully categorized and properly 
disposed of in accordance with both 
local and national regulations. This 
meticulous approach ensures that the 
handling, treatment, and disposal of 
hazardous materials meet all legal 
requirements and safety standards.
Negative
* There was no

3.
Product 
Quality & 
Safety
Opportunity
Product Safety is critical for aerospace 
and Defence entities due to their 
significant role in aviation and military 
operations. The Company is a preferred 
Indian Offset Partner (IOP) for IAI 
Group, Israel, specializing in the Indian 
defense market and catering to foreign 
OEMs for classified products.
The 
products 
are 
constructed 
according to the customers’ design 
and 
specifications. 
Manufacturing 
and testing follow standard operating 
procedures using Automatic Testing 
Equipment (ATEs) supplied by the 
Original 
Equipment 
Manufacturers 
(OEMs), ensuring compliance with 
quality and safety standards.

4.
Data Security
Risk
Given the aerospace and Defence 
industry’s involvement in developing 
sensitive 
military 
and 
advanced 
aviation products, entities within this 
sector face a heightened risk of cyber-
attacks. These attacks can target 
proprietary technologies, confidential 
military data, and critical infrastructure 
systems. 
Compromised 
information 
systems due to data security breaches 
can lead to significant costs, including 
financial losses, damage to reputation, 
legal liabilities, and loss of intellectual 
property. Moreover, such breaches can 
disrupt operations, jeopardize national 
security, and erode the trust of clients 
and government agencies.
The Company prioritizes data security 
due to its role in defence and aerospace 
manufacturing. To safeguard all aspects 
of data security, the Company has 
dedicated resources and established 
Standard Operating Procedures for 
information 
security, 
cyber-attacks, 
and data theft. Regular security audits 
and 
vulnerability 
assessments 
are 
conducted to identify and address 
potential weaknesses and associated 
risks. Implementing employee training 
programs 
on 
cybersecurity 
best 
practices is essential. Collaborating 
with 
cybersecurity 
experts 
and 
participating 
in 
information-sharing 
networks enhances threat intelligence. 
By taking these preventive measures, 
the Company aims to minimize the 
financial and reputational impacts 
of data breaches, ensuring system 
integrity, protecting client information, 
and maintaining customer trust.
Negative
* There was no 
negative financial 
impact 
in 
the 
reporting 
period 
of FY 23-24.
5.
Materials 
Sourcing & 
Efficiency of 
supply chain
Risk
Aerospace 
and 
defence 
entities 
encounter supply chain risks related 
to the use of critical materials in their 
products. These materials, which have 
limited or no substitutes, are often 
sourced from deposits concentrated 
in a few countries, making them 
vulnerable to geopolitical uncertainties. 
Additionally, increasing global demand 
from 
various 
sectors 
heightens 
competition, resulting in price hikes and 
supply risks. To mitigate the financial 
impacts of supply disruptions and 
fluctuating input prices, entities in this 
industry can explore alternative options 
and actively secure their supply chains 
to reduce reliance on critical materials.
To mitigate the supply chain risks 
associated with critical material sourcing, 
the Company has implemented strategic 
measures. It engages with pre-approved 
and vetted suppliers in accordance with 
OEM requirements. This approach, 
combined 
with 
established 
supply 
chain management, ensures that the 
Company is protected from delays 
or damage to materials needed for 
manufacturing, because of the well-
planned schedules for timely deliveries. 
Building strong supplier relationships 
and 
implementing 
robust 
supply 
chain management practices, such as 
monitoring and early warning systems, 
further enhance resilience.
Negative
* There was no 
negative financial 
impact 
in 
the 
reporting 
period 
of FY 23-24.
6.
Business Ethics
Opportunity
Aerospace 
and 
defence 
entities 
operating in regions with robust 
business 
ethics 
laws 
may 
face 
regulatory 
scrutiny 
due 
to 
their 
operations and sales in areas with less 
stringent enforcement of such laws. 
Consequently, implementing strong 
governance practices can help mitigate 
the risk of breaching business ethics 
laws and facing regulatory penalties 
or negative impacts on brand value. 
To ensure effective governance and 
address pertinent issues, the Company 
has adopted and follows all applicable 
regulations and laws.

chemical residues, are carefully stored in designated containers at their point of origin and then transferred to the scrap 
yard or identified disposal areas, ensuring no spillage or contamination occurs. We segregate metal scraps, e-waste, and

other hazardous materials, which are then responsibly disposed of through authorized recyclers and vendors. Additionally, 
we have minimized the use of hazardous and toxic chemicals in our products and processes by adopting eco-friendly 
alternatives where possible. Our strategy also includes regular supervision and strict adherence to environmental, health, 
and safety guidelines, ensuring that all waste handling and disposal practices safeguard both human health and the 
environment.
