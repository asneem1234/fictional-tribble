1
Product 
design & 
lifecycle 
management
Opportunity
Given the fact that the 
textile industry is highly 
resource-intensive, making 
the manufacturing of 
sustainable products a 
critical priority from an 
environmental and societal 
perspective. Assessing 
the lifecycle and design 
sustainability of textile 
products is essential to 
identify and mitigate the 
negative environmental 
impacts throughout 
the product’s lifecycle. 
Transitioning towards a 
circular economy model 
is crucial to reduce 
resource consumption, 
waste generation, and 
better capture the value of 
underutilized or discarded 
textile products.
In response to this 
need, the company 
has positioned itself 
as a manufacturer of 
environmentally friendly 
products. The company’s 
in-house R&D department 
plays a pivotal role, 
conducting activities 
such as product and 
quality improvement, 
new design development, 
new product creation, 
cost control, and energy 
conservation. These 
initiatives collectively help 
the company achieve 
sustainability in its 
product offerings.
Positive:
-	 Increasing revenues 
due to increasing 
demand for more 
sustainable products
-	 R&D and innovation 
leading to launch 
of new blends and 
designs, expanding the 
company’s portfolio
2
Customer 
centricity
Opportunity
Customers are the key 
pillars of any company, and 
it is crucial to maintain a 
customer-centric approach 
at the core of the business, 
both in thought and 
practice. At Siyaram, all 
the company’s initiatives, 
strategies, and plans are 
framed with the goal of 
ensuring satisfied and 
happy customers.
The company works 
diligently to translate 
customer feedback into 
its product portfolio. 
This involves producing 
high-demand products 
and launching modern 
designs that cater to the 
tastes and preferences 
of their customers’ 
wardrobes. The company 
remains steadfastly 
focused on providing 
the best possible 
clothing experience to its 
customers.
Positive:
-	 Satisfied customers 
can lead to repeat 
purchases and 
increased revenues.
-	 New product 
development as 
per customer 
demands enhancing 
the company’s 
competitiveness.
-	 Improved brand rep-
utation and customer 
loyalty, strengthening 
the company’s market 
position.

3
Sustainable 
sourcing
Risk/ 
Opportunity
Integration of social, 
ethical and environmental 
performance factors into 
the supplier selection 
process is critical for a 
textile manufacturing 
company.
The company is 
consistently working to 
incorporate sustainability 
into its raw material 
procurement practices. 
For example, Siyaram is 
one of the leading players 
in Polyviscose within India, 
while most competitors 
use cotton as the primary 
raw material. Siyaram’s 
use of Polyviscose as a 
substitute raw material is 
less expensive and more 
durable than cotton. 
The use of alternative 
materials also helps 
mitigate risks arising 
from rising commodity 
prices and shortages 
of conventional raw 
materials like cotton.
Furthermore, the 
company encourages 
local procurement of 
goods and services around 
its plant locations and 
regions. The company’s HR 
teams regularly conduct 
community development 
and training initiatives to 
educate local vendors, 
improve their capabilities, 
enhance their skills, and 
raise their employment 
opportunities and standard 
of living.
Positive:
-	 Cost efficiencies due 
to usage of lesser raw 
materials, recycled 
input materials, and 
flexible production
-	 Increase in revenues 
due to increasing 
demand from 
customers for more 
sustainable products  
Negative:
-	 Short-term business 
disruptions during the 
shift from conventional 
to sustainable raw 
materials.

Energy 
management
Risk/ 
Opportunity
The textile industry is a 
major energy-consuming 
sector, making energy 
management a critical 
priority. The rapid growth 
of process industries 
has led to substantial 
energy consumption 
in textile operations, 
underscoring the need 
for process optimizations 
and the adoption of the 
latest energy-efficient 
technologies.
Committed to 
environmental 
sustainability, the 
company is working 
towards reducing and 
optimizing energy 
consumption by 
incorporating new 
techniques and innovative 
ideas. The company 
has undertaken various 
green energy and 
greening initiatives across 
its locations, such as 
installing solar energy 
projects, implementing 
waste heat recovery 
systems, using variable 
frequency drives (VFDs) 
on various machines, 
replacing tube lights with 
LED lights, and using 
high-efficiency motors.
Positive:
-	 Energy efficiency and 
cost savings in the 
longer run, leading to 
more profitability
Negative:
-	 Cost of transition to 
newer, more energy-
efficient technologies 
in the short term
5
Water and 
wastewater 
management
The textile industry is highly 
dependent on water, from 
cotton cultivation to dyeing 
and finishing processes. 
The wastewater produced 
during these various 
production steps must be 
cleaned of fats, oils, colours, 
and other chemicals used. 
As a result, planning, 
developing, distributing, 
and managing the optimal 
use of water is especially 
important for a textile 
manufacturing company.
The company 
continuously takes several 
measures to conserve 
water. It has installed 
Reverse Osmosis (RO) 
and Multiple Effect 
Evaporation (MEE) 
systems to reuse effluent 
water. The company 
has also automated 
its chemical and dye 
dispensing systems and 
installed Common Effluent 
Treatment Plants (CETPs) 
at some plant locations to 
ensure proper discharge 
of effluents.
Negative:
-	 Business disruption 
due to non-availability 
of requisite quality of 
water
-	 Cost implications due 
to rising water prices
-	 Reputational 
implications due to 
improper treatment 
and discharge of 
wastewater
-	 Fines and penalties 
on account of non-
adherence to water 
pollution regulations

Climate 
change 
strategy
Risk
Climate change is 
increasingly recognized 
as a universal issue with 
broad implications on a 
company’s business and its 
ability to create value for 
stakeholders. Due to the 
textile industry’s complex 
supply chain and energy-
intensive production, it 
generates nearly 10% of 
global greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions. A large-
scale, systemic change is 
needed for the industry 
to limit global warming to 
1.5°C above pre-Industrial 
Revolution levels. Therefore, 
the company considers 
climate risk as one of the 
important material issues.
The company is taking 
concerted efforts to 
anticipate the adverse 
effects of climate change 
on its business and 
operations and is taking 
appropriate actions to 
mitigate the different 
implications of climate 
change and other ESG-
related factors across all 
its business operations.
Negative:
-	 Costs of transition 
to a lower-carbon 
economy
-	 Business disruption 
due to extreme 
weather events, 
such as cyclones, 
hurricanes, heat or 
cold waves, or floods 
and resultant revenue 
impact
7
Supply chain 
management
Risk/ 
Opportunity
The textile industry 
is characterized by a 
complex production 
network spanning 
multiple businesses and 
crossing national and 
international boundaries. 
Therefore, managing ESG 
(Environmental, Social, and 
Governance) risks within 
the company’s supply 
chain and addressing the 
environmental and social 
externalities created by 
suppliers through their 
operational activities is 
crucial for supply chain 
sustainability.
The company evaluates 
its suppliers and 
vendors based on 
their environmental 
responsibility, human 
rights, labour practices, 
ethics, and anti-corruption 
measures, along with 
the required quality 
standards. This ensures 
the highest standards in 
material procurement.
This proactive approach 
strengthens supply 
chain resilience, 
promotes responsible 
supplier relationships, 
and mitigates any 
adverse impacts on the 
environment and society.
Positive:
-	 ESG-compliant 
suppliers driving 
resource efficiencies 
across the value 
chain, leading to cost 
savings and improved 
profitability
Negative:
-	 Short-term business 
disruptions on account 
of non-compliant 
suppliers
-	 Cost implications 
associated with 
transitioning to and 
maintaining ESG-
compliant suppliers

Employee 
Health & 
Safety
Risk
The textile industry is a 
labour-intensive sector, 
and unsafe practices can 
significantly impact the 
well-being of workers 
and their families. 
Therefore, it is critical for 
the company to establish 
and scrupulously comply 
with safety procedures 
and protocols to prevent 
potential hazards.
The company has 
implemented an 
occupational health and 
safety management 
system and framed 
a Safety, Health & 
Environment (SHE) policy. 
This policy lays down 
clear safety protocols 
and instructions to be 
followed across all plants 
by all employees. The 
company also provides 
regular safety training 
for its employees 
and conducts safety 
assessments of its plants.
Negative:
-	 Impacts on the 
physical and mental 
health of employees/
workers, consequently 
affecting their 
productivity. This 
can impair the 
company’s ability 
to fulfill demand, 
cater to customer 
requirements, and 
grow revenues
-	 Increased liability and 
legal costs associated 
with workplace 
accidents or illnesses
-	 Reputational damage 
and loss of customer 
trust due to safety-
related incidents
9
Digitalization
Opportunity
Digitalization is a powerful 
tool that can help the 
company automate and 
streamline its business 
processes, reducing errors 
and improving efficiency 
and accuracy. By leveraging 
customer data and insights, 
the company can better 
understand and meet the 
needs of its customers, 
personalize its offerings, 
and enhance the overall 
customer experience.
As part of its digitalization 
initiative, the company has 
implemented a customer 
collection system that 
enables customers to 
view their outstanding 
invoices in real-time and 
make instant payments 
through the system itself. 
This facilitates automatic 
posting in the company’s 
SAP system, eliminating 
the need for manual 
reconciliation processes.
Positive
-	 Cost efficiency due to 
automation and the 
elimination of manual 
efforts, leading to 
improved profitability
-	 Streamlines the 
company’s internal 
processes and 
also enhances the 
customer experience, 
fostering stronger 
relationships and 
potentially increasing 
customer loyalty and 
retention

A localized emergency is one which is of minor consequence to life and property, and which can be dealt with 
locally e.g., at the factory by available staff as required with or without ad hoc assistance. Such an emergency 
does not normally influence operations in other parts of the factory.
	
	
	
Fire involving limited area within administrative building, control room; fire involving limited area in utility 
building are some examples of a localized emergency.
	
	
•	
LEVEL-II (PLANT EMERGENCY)

come into effect. It affects operations in the whole unit, immediately or potentially and of areas in the vicinity.

A major emergency is an emergency escalated to such size and scope that it becomes of a great and serious 
consequence to life and property at the unit as a whole and the areas outside the unit.
	
	
	
The company has implemented a rigorous approach to identifying, understanding, controlling, and managing 
risks associated with workplace hazards such as human-machine interaction, process safety and fire hazards.

of creating a safe working environment.
	
	
	
We provide frequent training programs on standard safety measures and best practices are communicated to 
all plant locations. Employee contribution in incident reporting, safety observations and near-miss reporting are 
a top priority for us. We present corrective steps taken during incident investigations at quarterly meetings and 
ensure their effective implementation through appropriate actions.

Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and 
social topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.
	
The company has a structured stakeholder engagement framework to gather feedback from key stakeholder groups. This 
feedback is presented by departments to the Stakeholder Relationship Committee of the Board. The Committee reviews 
the inputs, monitors compliance status, and provides recommendations to the Board on a quarterly basis. The Board then 
directs the implementation of relevant suggestions arising from the stakeholder consultations.
2.

We actively consult with a diverse range of internal and external stakeholders, including the government, regulatory 
bodies, distributors, suppliers, and local communities, through formal meetings, consultation sessions, and digital 
platforms. This regular dialogue enhances our transparency, responsiveness, compliance, organizational learning, and 
overall sustainability.
	
Our stakeholder engagement process systematically identifies the key environmental, social, and governance concerns. 
The valuable insights and feedback received through these consultations are carefully analysed and incorporated into 
our policy formulation and decision-making. This enables us to effectively address the material ESG issues relevant to our 
operations and drive long-term business sustainability.
3.

For the local communities around our areas of operation, we primarily channel our efforts through targeted CSR initiatives. 
These include providing educational assistance to needy and underprivileged students, offering free medical checkups 
and healthcare support through NGO partnerships, and contributing medical equipment to improve cancer treatment 
facilities. Similarly, for our marginalized suppliers and vendors, we conduct various skill-based training programs and 
awareness sessions. These interventions are aimed at enhancing their capabilities and overall socioeconomic upliftment.
