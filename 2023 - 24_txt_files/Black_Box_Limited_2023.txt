Climate
Risk
Climate change is a growing 
concern around the world as 
it causes direct and indirect 
economic impacts on 
businesses.
As a trusted supply chain 
partner to several Fortune 
500 companies, Black Box is 
committed to transparency 
in climate-related 
disclosures, including CDP 
and SBTi reporting. To meet 
our customers’ expectations, 
it is crucial to conduct a 
comprehensive assessment 
of our global GHG footprint 
and set ambitious targets 
for reducing emissions, 
aligning with our dedication 
to sustainability and 
environmental stewardship.
Our business operations 
are spread across the globe 
with our office locations, 
employees, supply chain, 
partners, and customers as 
an integrated part of our 
value chain. The physical 
risks posed by Climate 
Change - such as extreme 
weather events, and changes 
in climate patterns may 
cause threats to the safety 
of people, damage to 
infrastructure, and disruption 
of the supply chain because 
of delays in deliveries, 
which may have financial 
implications in the future.

estimations across 
global operations
 
 Design and 
implementation  
of decarbonization  
program.

sustainability into 
business strategies

Energy 
Efficiency
Opportunity
We provide design, 
installation, maintenance, 
and consultancy services in 
the Information technology

from the design stage, we 
can achieve a significant 
reduction in electricity 
consumption for our 
customers. This creates the 
opportunity to serve large 
customers across the globe 
who are committed to the 
emission reduction targets 
which in turn creates a 
revenue opportunity for 
us and at the same time 
reduces the scope-3 GHG 
footprint of Black Box.

a.	
Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No) 
	
	
Yes. To integrate sustainability in the supply chain, Black Box ensures that its supply chain partners adhere to 
ethical and sustainable practices. 
	
	
Black Box has a broad network of global suppliers. Some of them provide materials, some are contract 
manufacturers, some are OEM suppliers and some of them provide software and services. Though we have 
an active approved vendor list, we conduct supplier assessments to maintain supplier quality and assurance 
throughout the supply chain. A basic requirement for approval of a supplier is quality testing, production samples, 
and evaluation of the quality system. For critical materials (which make up more than 20% of the product group, 
sole-sourced, or which has long-term customer requirements), a due diligence assessment is conducted. Also, 
factory inspection is conducted in some cases. The supplier questionnaire contains questions to check the 
existence of the Export Compliance Program, Quality Management System, Health, Safety and Environment 
policy, International Traffic in Arms Rules (ITAR), etc. We conduct quarterly business reviews and periodic re-audit 
and re-evaluations for our suppliers.
	
	
Black Box is also redesigning its supply and purchasing agreement through which it will ensure sustainability 
at the supplier’s end. Aspects such as human rights, labor practices, compliance with the laws and regulations, 
environmental protection, and disclosure mechanisms are taken into consideration while redesigning.

Our customers are also made aware of the E-waste management system at Black Box through which they can 
recycle their products at the end of the product’s life. Through these sustainable sourcing practices, Black Box 
aims to reduce its environmental impact, support ethical supply chains, and contribute to a more sustainable 
industry. This year, we are planning to introduce a Sustainable procurement policy for integrating environmental, 
social, and governance considerations into our purchasing and supply chain practices.
	
b.	
If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?  
	
	
Currently, we do not track this information. However, the implementation of a sustainable procurement policy is 
planned for this year onwards. 
3.	
Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling, and disposal at the 
end of life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste, and (d) other waste
	
We are primarily an Information & Communication Technologies (ICT) Solution Integration and consulting firm; the 
overall environmental impact is minimal. We have robust processes for waste management. We identify and manage 
each type of waste and follow regular waste management practices. We abide by the region-specific regulatory norms 
for the management of waste.
	
The following are the processes in place for reuse, recycling, and disposal:
	
Black Box has implemented the e-waste collection system through the third-party authorized vendors across 
the USA. This ensures that all the e-waste is collected and recycled.
	
Black Box complies with the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Regulations. In regions 
such as Austria, Finland, Luxembourg, Spain, Sweden, and the UK where Black Box has established recycling 
contracts with authorized recyclers, it provides finance for the treatment, recycling, and recovery of WEEE 
from customers on a one-for-one and like-for-like basis.
	
Region-specific regulations are adopted by the Black Box to comply with WEEE regulations:
 
 
The Austrian Ordinance on Waste Prevention, Collection, and Treatment of Waste Electrical and Electronic 
Equipment (WEEE Ordinance) in Austria
 
 
The Finnish Waste Act which implements regulations for Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment 
(WEEE) in Finland
 
 
Regulation 013/2005 for Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) in Luxembourg
 
 
The Spanish Royal Decree 208/2005 on Electrical and Electronic Equipment and Management in Spain
b.	
E-waste: 
	
Plastic used in the packaging is recycled through authorized recyclers. We are also exploring the option of 
biodegradable plastic and reusing recycled parts of the product through discussion with our value chain.

In Hungary and Poland, dealers sell Black Box equipment. They comply with the WEEE regulations.
In Switzerland, Black Box has joined the compliance scheme of SWICO which is approved by Swiss authorities.
In Norway, Black Box has joined the compliance scheme of RENAS which is approved by the Ministry of 
Environment of Norway.
In some regions, such as Belgium, France, Germany, and the Netherlands, regardless of whether the equipment is 
being replaced by a new piece of equipment from Black Box, we take back the equipment for recycling and disposal.
France complies with the French Decree on the Prevention and Management of Waste Electrical and Electronic 
Equipment (WEEE), Germany complies with the Germany Act Governing the Sale, Return and Environmentally 
Sound Disposal of Electrical and Electronic Equipment (ElektroG) Act and the Netherlands complies with the 
Dutch Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Management Regulations.
Belgium has three different regions Flanders, Wallonia, and Brussel Capital that comply with two different 
regulations – Waste Prevention and Management Ordinance (VLAREA) in Flanders, Producer Responsibility Decree 
in Wallonia, and Brussel Capital.
In Denmark, The Danish Order transposes the WEEE directive for Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment where 
local authorities establish a collection system that collects WEEE arising from households as well as from businesses.
In Italy, the WEEE directive is transposed by the Italian Decree to implement the 2002/96/EC Waste Electrical and 
Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive.
Black Box does not have a sales office in facilities such as Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, 
Malta, Portugal, Slovenia, and Slovakia. Black Box products are sold directly to business end-users from sales offices 
in other Member States through Distance selling. The WEEE Directive and Member State WEEE Regulations 
state that Black Box is not responsible for WEEE arising from distance sales of business products. Instead, it is the 
business end-user’s responsibility to ensure that products that they buy through distance selling arrangements are 
managed in an environmentally responsible manner at the end of life.
In India, Black Box is complying with E-waste management rules, 2022. Black Box has collaborated with E-Waste 
Recyclers India (EWRI) to comply with the E-Waste Management and Handling rules by providing drop-off centers 
and environmentally sound management of end-of-life electronics. There are 24 collection centers of EWRI where 
customers can drop their E-waste for recycling.

a.	
Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity. (Yes/ 
No). If yes, the coverage of such a system? 
	
	
Yes. We have effectively implemented the OHS management systems at an organizational level. It covers all our 
operations whether at our premises or customers' place. We also incorporate the customer’s OHS requirements 
during the various activities we conduct at customer premises (such as installations, maintenance, and other 
services). Additionally, we insist our suppliers comply with the applicable OHS requirements while working at our 
premises or at our customer’s locations as required.
	
	
Our Health, Safety, and Environment Policy emphasizes the responsibility of all employees to maintain safety at 
the workplace. It includes protocols to prevent accidents related to falls, fire, and electricity. It also has mentioned 
guidelines and measures for safety related to office ergonomics. The policy ensures that employees are well 
informed about the Emergency Evacuation Plan. Annual fire drills are conducted at all our branches to respond 
to any fire emergency. Sprinklers, smoke detectors, and fire extinguishers are placed in office premises across 
all regions. Frequent equipment checks, such as air conditioners, chillers, UPS, etc. are performed periodically. 
Emergency contact details are displayed on the notice board with contacts of the nearest police station. The 24/7 
facility emergency contact number is displayed on the Company nameplate.
	
	
Black Box’s Safety Policy and Procedure Manual is a comprehensive document where procedures of risk 
calculation, hazard identification, and analysis, incident reporting, record keeping, and emergency action plans 
are well documented. This manual has safe work practices for each process that involves potential hazards. 
	
b.	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine 
basis by the entity?  
	
	
At Black Box, work-related hazard analysis is an ongoing and continuous process. The hazard analysis is used 
to identify and evaluate hazards or potential hazards and possible control measures to reduce or mitigate the 
hazards in the workplace.
	
	
Hazard assessment is documented via a written certification that has information related to the name of the 
workplace evaluated, the name of the person who performed the hazard analysis, the date of assessment, and a 
statement that indicates that this is a certification of hazard assessment.
	
	
The process allows us to monitor operations and identify new hazard areas as they become apparent due to 
changes in operational procedures or hazardous environments encountered at new customer locations. On 
project sites, the Customer or General Contractor may require that our Team Members or our subcontractors 
perform a hazard analysis before starting a task. We utilize a variety of risk assessment tools including job hazard 
analysis (JHA) reviews, pre-task planning (PTP) checklists, and/or personal protective equipment risk assessment 
checklists to document these activities. The risk assessment tools may classify and rank hazards according to risk 
using a risk ranking matrix. The concerned personnel review and update written assessments whenever there is 
a change in process, equipment, or facility layout.

Black Box conducts regular inspections at the workplace to provide the highest emphasis on Health and Safety 
issues both for routine and non-routine work. Through these inspections, we identify potential hazards and 
unsafe practices. Hazardous equipment or flammable liquids that are harmful, dangerous, or injurious to the 
employees are not used by the entity. Our Safety Policy and Procedure Manual covers the safe work practices for 
every process that involves potential hazards.
	
c. 	
Whether you have processes for workers to report work-related hazards and to remove themselves from 
such risks. (Y/N)  
	
	
Yes. We have incident reporting processes at various locations globally. The processes vary to a certain extent as 
per the location-specific scenarios; however, the overall approach that we adopt globally for work-related hazard 
reporting is described in this section. 
	
	
Employee/worker can notify his/ her immediate supervisor of a potential hazard, violation, or deficiency in safe 
and healthy working conditions, recommending corrective measures, if possible, or correcting the hazard. 
Additionally, the employee’s immediate supervisor is to be notified of every injury, accident, or near-miss incident 
regardless of how trivial such an accident or incident may appear at that time.
	
	
The supervisor then immediately reports about the injury/accident to the Risk Management Committee. Risk 
Management provides the appropriate incident report template to document the event to the affected person 
and their supervisor. The affected person and/or their supervisor should complete the appropriate form and 
return it to the Risk Management Committee within 24 hours of the event.
	
d.	
Do the employees/workers of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services? 
	
	
Black Box provides a well-maintained medical room with a medical bed for all the employees in case of medical 
emergencies. Wheelchairs are available for employees who are unwell. The emergency contact numbers of 
doctors and ambulances are displayed on the notice boards of the Company so that employees can have quick 
access to the information. A medical emergency facility is available on campus with trained doctors and nurses. 
First aid kits are always available at all facilities.
	
	
Black Box has conducted health check-up camps, yoga sessions, etc. for all employees across all regions.
