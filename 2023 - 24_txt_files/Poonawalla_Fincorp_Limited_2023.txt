ensuring the data 
security is of prime 
importance
The Company has a

policies are implemented 
at an organizational level.
Various awareness 
sessions and internal 
newsletters, mock drills 
are conducted to avoid

R&D
As we are a non-banking financial company, capital expenditure and research and development expenses 
are not directed towards technologies that improve environmental and social impacts. We have successfully 
completed digital transformation & Phase 2 of technology transformation enabling Digital First products, 
processes & entire customer journey and now we are evaluating opportunities to finance products that 
may have impact on the environment and communities. We have also implemented AI based solution for

Capex
2. 	 Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)
	
Yes
	
b. If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?
	
Being a non-banking financial company, our direct consumption of consumable and input materials 
is limited. The primary resource consumption of the Company is printing paper. The Company entered 
into vendor agreements for procurement of paper and tracks consumption of resources to reduce 
their wastage.
	
Above all, the Company also emphasized on integrating sustainable practices within the value chain 
(suppliers and customers) through acceptance of payments through automated clearing house (ACH)/
Auto Debit/Digital/online mode which in turn helped the customers in paper less transaction. To avoid 
further usage of paper, the customer documents are stored digitally.
	
The corporate office is a Platinum certified Green Building. Certified green buildings focus on the use of 
recycled materials instead of virgin materials. Such materials are certified, have lower carbon footprint and 
are sourced and used in a sustainable manner with minimal or no adverse effects to the environment. The 
Company is not tracking the percentage of inputs sourced sustainably.
3. 	 Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing 
at the end of life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other 
waste.
	
The Company’s primary waste products comprise paper waste and electronic waste.
	
Paper Waste: The Company has minimized paper usage through digital technologies and process 
optimization. As a non-banking financial company, paper is a major resource consumed. To promote 
sustainable service delivery, the Company encourages paperless transactions and implements a paper 
recycling initiative for old printouts. Payments are accepted through electronic modes, reducing the 
need for paper. Vendor payments are made electronically as well. Various initiatives are in place to reduce 
paper usage, such as online lead generation, digital customer transactions, an e-learning platform for 
employees, and SMS updates during loan processing. System-generated reports are no longer printed, 
and files are processed digitally whenever possible. The Company prioritizes digital storage of documents 
and communicates with customers primarily via email, SMS, and inbound calls.
	
Encouraging usage of green chemicals for corporate office and branches to reduce harmful effect on the 
users and the environment.
	
Efforts are being made to reduce the usage of paper cups by introducing reusable glasses and cups made 
up by organic material like rice husk. Tissue papers are replaced with recycled/recyclable paper rolls to 
curb the usage and wastage.
	
Enhanced awareness about sustainability among employees through frequent e-mailers, digital content 
display across the offices and awareness workshops.

environmental, and social topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations 
provided to the Board.
	
The Company actively engages with stakeholders to enhance performance and create value for the 
ecosystem and its own operations. The methods of consultation vary depending on the stakeholder group.
	
For shareholders and investors, the Company utilizes earnings calls, conferences, quarterly meetings, 
annual general meetings, and grievance channels. While sustainability discussions have emerged recently, 
the focus remains on strategy and performance.
	
Customer consultations take place through surveys and social media, covering topics such as customer 
service, complaints, new products, community involvement, and more.
	
Employee engagement is a top priority, with various platforms and communication channels utilized. 
This includes addressing complaints and concerns, providing feedback and evaluations, sharing news 
through internal newsletters and emails, conducting town hall meetings, and organizing awareness 
programs. Feedback received is recorded as meeting minutes and discussed by function heads and senior 
management for possible implementation. For dissemination of organization-level information to the 
employees, the employee connect framework was modified. Through this the mechanism to connect the 
branch heads with the HR team, conduct townhalls with the Functional Heads were practiced. This process 
allowed the Company to acknowledge the challenges faced by the employees, provide resolutions and 
allows discussion with the senior members of the organization. As a forward looking step, the Company 
launched an initiative My Branch, My Pride through which the Senior leaders have been assigned select 
branches to ensure engagement with employees, understand their challenges and provide appropriate 
resolutions. This was also initiated to set an example of approachable leadership for the employees and 
ensuring the aspect of inclusiveness for all.

enhancing our practices.

We have instituted ESG policy that outline our commitment for each of the focus area identified by us.
	
The discussion of employees with HR and team leads has also helped the Company to incorporate

and practices to promote a fair workplace.
3. 	 Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of

To avoid spreading false information about the organization, whenever journalists or media outlets ask

engages with the media to keep stakeholders updated about the Company. The Company thinks that 
the unbanked and underbanked people in urban India are less likely to integrate into India’s mainstream 
economy, which makes them vulnerable to socioeconomic exploitation. Through its CSR initiative, the 
Company aims to improve the lives of underprivileged individuals and all the CSR projects aims to address 
the concerns of marginalized stakeholder groups and promote society’s holistic development. For further 
details on our CSR programmes please refer annual CSR report.

8. 	 Does the entity have any project related to reducing GreenHouse Gas emission? If Yes, then provide 
details. 
	
Yes
	
The Company has taken the following initiatives to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions:
 
	
Awareness generation among the employees to conserve and responsibly use electricity.
 
	
Reduction of usage of energy (through installation of LED bulbs, energy efficient electrical equipment 
and retrofitting LED lights in branch offices.)
 
	
E-waste management and handling, distribution of sapling and paper conservation (e.g. both side 
printing, re-use of papers, PIN based controlled printing) and paper waste recycling.
 
	
The corporate office is in a Platinum certified green building.
 
	
The Company has managed all the electrical equipment in a manner so that they help to conserve 
energy. The Company has initiated installation of LED lights in new and upcoming branches 
wherever possible. The Company is also in the process of replacing existing lights with LED lights in a 
phased manner.
 
	
Energy consumption would reduce as a result of these initiatives, either directly or indirectly. Energy 
conservation would significantly contribute to the mitigation of global warming in our nation due to 
the predominant use of fossil fuels for energy production, which results in greenhouse gas emissions 
and climate change.
