Energy Efficiency Leadership: As a BEE Grade-I ESCO, we are actively promoting energy conservation 
within our operations and have set an ambitious target of achieving 50% renewable energy consumption 
by 2025.
●
●
Sustainable Practices: We prioritize responsible water management, minimize material consumption, 
and manage waste responsibly, striving for "Zero Waste to Landfill" by 2030.
●
●
Biodiversity Conservation: Through careful route selection, environmental assessments, and collaboration 
with experts, we minimize the impact of our infrastructure on wildlife and natural habitats.
●
●
Green Cover Development: Our extensive afforestation drives have significantly expanded green cover, 
contributing to carbon sequestration and environmental well-being.
●
●
Technological Innovation: We are constantly pioneering innovative technologies like multi-circuit towers 
and natural ester oil reactors, reducing land use and environmental impact.
This report represents just a snapshot of our ongoing efforts. We are committed to achieving Net Zero status by 
2047 and remain dedicated to exceeding our ESG goals.

STATCOM’s in RE Pooling Stations viz. Bhadla-II, Bikaner-II, 
Fatehgarh-II
	
A STATCOM is a device that helps maintain stability in the power 
grid by managing voltage fluctuations. It works much faster than 
traditional methods and is particularly useful for integrating 
renewable energy sources like solar and wind, which can be 
unpredictable. STATCOMs were first used in India at solar power 
plants in Rajasthan to improve grid stability and reliability.
2.	
ERS up to 400kV Twin Moose transmission lines through 
indigenous vendor development: 
	
POWERGRID relies on Emergency Restoration Systems (ERS) 
to swiftly repair damaged power lines. Previously, these ERS 
components, like mast sections and insulated crossarms, were 
entirely imported. To promote Indian manufacturing, POWERGRID 
launched a program to develop domestic suppliers for high-
voltage ERS (up to 400 kV), aiming to create a self-sufficient 
supply chain for future repairs.
3.	
400kV Twin Mono Poles at Mohanlalganj
	
To strengthen the power grid in a congested urban area, a unique 
solution using twin monopoles was implemented. Traditional 
towers wouldn't fit, and extending existing ones wasn't feasible. 
This design uses two steel monopoles connected horizontally for 
increased stability and load capacity. This approach reduced the 
footprint, improved aesthetics, and simplified construction and 
maintenance.

POWERGRID is involved in building the infrastructure to evacuate 
renewable energy. These projects involve building new substations 
and transmission lines, particularly in areas where there is   high 
concentration of solar and wind farms. This will strengthen the grid 
and allow for the smooth integration of more renewable energy into 
the national grid.
2.	
a. Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)
	
POWERGRID follows a set of pre-defined processes and procedures towards sustainable sourcing for its 
various procurement needs. These processes and procedures are designed to ensure that POWERGRID's 
procurement activities are environmentally and socially responsible and that they comply with all relevant 
statutory requirements.
	
Some of the key elements of POWERGRID's sustainable procurement practices include:
●
●
Compliance with statutory requirements: POWERGRID requires all contractors to comply with all relevant 
laws and regulations related to pollution prevention, labor standards and occupational health and safety 
like The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, The 
Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, Contract Labor (Regulation & Abolition) Act 1970, 
Employee’s Compensation Act 1923, Equal Remuneration Act 1979, Minimum Wages Act 1948, Child Labor 
(Prohibition & Regulation) Act 1986 etc.
●
●
Development of an environmental management plan: Contractors that are awarded contracts 
for supply-cum-installation packages are required to develop and implement an environmental 
management plan. This plan must identify and assess the environmental impacts of the project and it 
must outline the measures that will be taken to mitigate these impacts.

prioritize the implementation of control measures.
	
POWERGRID employs a wide range of control measures to effectively mitigate risks associated with identified 
hazards. These measures include eliminating or substituting hazardous elements, implementing cutting-

POWERGRID believes that growth and success of business multiplies when human rights and values are 
respected and protected. The Company has formulated its Human Rights policy to express & institutionalize 
its commitment to embrace practices that support human rights in every geography where it operates. 
Compliance to the human rights policy is ensured at the Offices/ Projects/ Stations/ Regions by the respective 
heads and at the Corporate Centre by Executive Director (HR). Executive Director (HR) is also the nodal officer 
for receipt of complaints/ grievances regarding human rights violation.
5.	
Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues. 
	
At POWERGRID, the reverence for the dignity and untapped potential of every individual lies at the core of their 
values. Recognizing that a steadfast commitment to human rights policy is paramount for both the growth 
and success of the business, POWERGRID aims to achieve the following objectives:
a.	 Upholding the Social and Economic Dignity: Ensuring that all employees are treated with respect, fairness 
and equality, regardless of gender, race, status or religion.
b.	 Commitment to Human Rights and Labor Standards: Adhering to Indian laws and International Human 
Rights Agreements, safeguarding every worker’s/employee’s fundamental rights. 
	
To reinforce its commitment to human rights, POWERGRID has implemented a robust internal framework. The 
Executive Director (HR) serves as the nodal officer for human rights complaints and grievances. Additionally, 
liaison officers address discrimination-related complaints, nodal officers manage issues under the Whistle 
Blower & Fraud Prevention Policy, and the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) handles sexual harassment 
complaints. These specialized avenues ensure individuals can voice concerns and seek resolution. 
Complementing these efforts, the Vigilance and HR Departments address code of conduct violations. Through

It may be noted that in POWERGRID establishments, water is mainly used for domestic purpose (except for 
a small quantity of water which is used as a makeup water for cooling purpose). There is no use of water 
for industrial purpose resulting in no generation of industrial effluents. At the same time, no products are 
produced in our business activities. Hence, there is no product embedded water in our business activities. The 
wastewater generated in our establishments is essentially domestic sewage consisting of black water and 
grey water, which is turn, is treated with either Soak pits or Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) and only a small 
quantity of this domestic sewage generated from the establishments located in urban areas is discharged 
into municipal sewerage system. Hence, in order to bring the required clarity, water consumption has been 
taken as water withdrawal, while providing the details of wastewater generated, its treatment and disposal.

Yes, POWERGRID has a mechanism in place to ensure Zero Liquid discharge, in spite of the fact that no industrial 
effluents are generated in our substations. The only wastewater generated in our campuses is domestic 
sewage (a mixture of Black and Grey Water) from offices and residential campuses, which is treated either by 
soak pits or Sewage Treatment Plants (STP) and reused in the campus itself. Only a small quantity of domestic 
sewage generated in a few offices located in urban areas is discharged in municipal sewerage system.

our substations is Diesel Generators, which are used only as a backup 
arrangement and occasionally run mainly for testing purpose for very 
short duration, as our substations have two very stable source of auxiliary

Considering the catastrophic impacts of climate change, there is broad consensus among various 
stakeholders including Policy makers, Investors, Financial Institutions, Industries and citizens that every 
possible efforts should be made to control and mitigate this possibly the greatest threat to the existence 
of Earth. POWERGRID as a responsible organization comprehensively shares this sense of urgency of taking 
effective measures to combat climate crisis, the world is facing today. Guided by our ambitious Goal of 
becoming a Net Zero Emission organization as mandated by our Board approved ESG Policy, we have started 
many initiatives towards reducing our Green House Gas emission:
●
●
Management of SF6: SF6 gas, which is a highly potent Green Huse gas forms the bulk of our Scope-1 
emissions. Due to a tight inventory management and leakage management system being practiced 
in POWERGRID, the leakage rate of SF6 remains well below the acceptable limits (1% for AIS and 0.5% for 
GIS). In FY 2023-24, our SF6 leakage has reduced by almost 44.65%. However, POWERGRID is also seriously 
considering replacing it with other technically feasible and economically viable alternatives. With the 
fast-paced technological developments around SF6, we are hopeful about staggered phase out of the 
same. In fact, we have started the process of replacing SF6 in two of our substations located at Imphal 
and Badarpur on a pilot basis. Depending upon the results of these trials as well as availability of suitable 
technology in the form of viable alternatives, we will plan SF6 phase out at higher voltage level substations.
●
●
Reducing dependence on Grid Electricity by adopting Renewable sources of Energy: Our Scpe-2 emissions, 
which results from purchase of Grid electricity forms around 66% of our total emissions. POWERGRID is 
committed to derive 50% of its power requirements from Non fossil sources by 2025. Accordingly, we are 
taking every effort to enhance our Solar PV capacity. Currently, at our various locations, the total solar 
Directors’ Report
262
263
INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT (FY 23-24)
INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT (FY 23-24)
PV installed is around 10.2 MW, which is fulfilling around 2.6% of our total electricity requirements. Further, 
85 MW of dedicated solar plant is under installation at Nagda (MP), which is expected to significantly 
enhance the percentage of renewables in our power consumption mix, thus substantially reducing our 
Scope-2 emissions. Additionally, around 80 MW of dedicated solar plants are in the planning stage. 
●
●
Focus on developing Green Cover: POWERGRID is aware that trees/Forests play an important role in 
fighting climate change by absorbing atmospheric Carbon Dioxide apart from providing several other 
benefits such as preventing soil erosion, flooding and urban heat island phenomena. Accordingly, we 
have set an ambitious target for ourselves of developing a green cover at our premises. During FY 2023-
24, 53885 trees were planted in addition to already existing trees, resulting in a green cover consisting 
of total number of standing trees at 7,53,153 in our premises located across the length and breadth of 
the country. Additionally, during last 10 years 73,549 trees were planted under our CSR initiatives. In total 
the Green cover developed by us is responsible for an offset of 5.23% of our total emissions. Furthermore, 
POWERGRID has planned to participate in Green Credit Program of Government of India, which focuses on 
rejuvenation of degraded forest land of the country.

Note: As mentioned in earlier section, POWERGRID’s activities don’t involve any chemical process. As such, 
no process wastes are generated in its establishments. Most of the industrial wastes consist of C&D Wastes 
and Scrap materials generated after their useful life during Operation & Maintenance activities. Accordingly, 
no clear trend in the quantity of different kinds of waste produced would be possible. Note: Indicate if any 
independent assessment/ evaluation/assurance has been carried out by an external agency? (Y/N) If yes, 
name of the external agency.

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy 
adopted by your Company to reduce the usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and 
processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
	
POWERGRID’s waste management practices are guided by the principles of Reduce, Recycle and Reuse, as 
defined in its “Waste Management Policy”, which in turn is duly approved by its Board. Accordingly, POWERGRID 
ensures proper recycling and reuse of the waste material generated in its establishment either in house 
or through M/s MSTCL, A Miniratna Public Sector Enterprise or by returning the waste material to producer 
in line with newly introduced principle of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR), while fully complying with 
all applicable regulations. A small quantity of Hazardous waste consisting of STP Sludge is handed over to 
Authorized Agencies for Environmentally sound disposal. Another, important feature of our approach towards 
waste management is responsible consumption of resources, which not only results in preservation of 
precious natural resources, but also helps in reducing the quantity of waste materials generated.

Provide information on the project(s) for which ongoing Rehabilitation and Resettlement (R&R) is being

During the reporting period, POWERGRID reiterated its commitment to responsible land acquisition practices. 
Whether it be securing government-owned land for its substations or voluntarily engaging in direct land 
purchases on a "Willing Buyer Willing Seller" basis at fair market or negotiated rates, the Company ensures 
that all land acquisitions are carried out with utmost transparency and mutual consent. It is important to note 
that there have been no instances of involuntary land acquisition, thereby eliminating the presence of Project 
Affected Persons (PAP) or Project Displaced Persons (PDP). Consequently, the need for extensive Resettlement 
and Rehabilitation (R&R) activities has not arisen.
	
However, POWERGRID's dedication to social progress extends beyond land acquisition. Through its robust 
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives, the Company proactively supports the broader community. 
These initiatives focus on uplifting the well-being and prosperity of the local communities, promoting

CSR endeavors, POWERGRID contributes to the holistic growth and welfare of the communities it operates in, 
establishing itself as a catalyst for positive change.
	
In summary, POWERGRID's land acquisition practices demonstrate its unwavering commitment to ethical 
and voluntary approaches. While ensuring the absence of involuntary displacement, the Company extends

Describe the mechanisms to receive and redress grievances of the community. 
	
In accordance with the broad principles of the policy framework and the parameters of the Government of 
India's stated guidelines, grievance redressal is always given top priority in the Company. We have created 
an online interface through which employees may file grievances. 
	
For systematic and fast settlement of grievances within predetermined time periods, the Company has 
established nodal officials at corporate and regional offices. To comply with GOI guidelines on reservation 
concerns for SC/ ST/ OBC/ Ex-servicemen/ PWD, a Reservation Cell has been established at both the corporate 
and regional levels.
	
The Company has also developed a Citizen's Charter that outlines its Vision, Mission and  Objectives in a clear 
and precise manner. This also includes the Company's principles, commitments, expectations from citizens, 
integrated management policy, services offered, values and standards of services, access to information 
and  grievance redressal.
	
To further smoothen the relationship with community, we have developed an effective Grievance Redress 
Mechanism (GRM) to resolve any grievance of community/public. The GRM has two tiers, the first being 
Project/Substation level Grievance Redress Committee (GRC) and the second being the Corporate Level GRC 
chaired by the Director (Projects) of the Company. All written and verbal complaints received by Project level 
GRC are to be resolved within 20 days of receipt of complaint. If the complainant is not satisfied with the 
outcome of the project level GRC, he/she can approach the Corporate Level GRC, which in turn, has to resolve 
the complaint/grievance within 45 days. Notice regarding Corporate Level GRC is publicly available and can 
be accessed at:
