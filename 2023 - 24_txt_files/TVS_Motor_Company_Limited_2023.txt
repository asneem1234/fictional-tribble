1
Water
R
Unpredictable Rainfall: Changing 
weather patterns, including 
phenomena like El Nino, can lead 
to unreliable rainfall patterns, 
impacting water supplies. 
- Groundwater Depletion: 
Overexploitation of groundwater 
resources is causing the water 
table to recede, making access 
to freshwater increasingly 
difficult. - Stricter Regulations: 
Evolving regulations around water 
usage might impose limitations 
on TVSM's water consumption, 
potentially impacting production 
processes.
- Business Continuity Risk: Water 
shortages can disrupt operations, 
leading to production downtime 
and reduced overall productivity. - 
Community Relations Challenge: 
Water is a shared resource, and 
competition for limited supplies 
can lead to tensions with local 
communities. - Operational 
Constraints: Stricter regulations 
on groundwater extraction could 
significantly limit TVSM's access to 
water, impacting core operations. 
- Increased Reliance on External 
Sources: TVSM's might need to rely 
more heavily on third-party water 
suppliers, potentially at higher costs 
and with less control over availability.
Negative 
Implications
2
Waste & Recycling
R
Addressing Manufacturing 
Waste Challenges: - Growing 
Waste Volume: The increasing 
amount of waste generated by 
our production processes creates 
logistical and environmental 
hurdles. - Inefficient Recycling: 
Current recycling practices by 
our partners are inadequate, 
leading to wasted resources and 
potential environmental harm. - 
Stricter EPR Regulations: Evolving 
Extended Producer Responsibility 
(EPR) requirements pose new 
challenges for responsible waste 
management. - Co-processing 
Challenges: Identifying suitable 
partners for co-processing 
hazardous waste remains an 
ongoing task. - Landfill Reliance: 
The current system diverts a 
significant portion of waste to 
landfills, which is an unsustainable 
solution. - Policy and Guidance 
Gaps: The lack of a robust legal 
framework and practical guidelines 
hinders efforts to improve material 
recovery rates and minimise 
greenhouse gas emissions.
- Financial impact: The anticipated 
high cost of meeting Extended 
Producer Responsibility (EPR) 
requirements for batteries and other 
regulated waste streams could 
significantly impact on our budget. - 
Compliance risk: Failure to comply 
with EPR regulations can lead to hefty 
environmental compensation charges. 
This, along with potential reputational 
damage, could negatively impact 
TVSM's brand image.

3
Living Wages
R
The national minimum wage, 
unchanged since 2017: 
enforcement is not consistent 
across, which has led to unfair 
variations in worker pay. - Aligning 
with Global Standards: The 
government is proposing a new 
definition of wages that adheres 
to international labour standards 
set by the International Labour 
Organization (ILO). - Living Wage 
Focus: The new approach will 
consider a "living wage" that 
considers both national income 
and the ability of industries to pay.
- Implementing living wage increases 
will directly impact on production 
costs due to higher employee salaries. 
- A possibility that some suppliers, 
particularly small and medium-sized 
enterprises (SMEs), may struggle to 
comply with the wage hike which can 
lead to disruptions in the supply chain. 
- Suppliers might raise their prices 
for components or services to offset 
their own increased labor costs. This 
could further inflate overall production 
expenses
Negative 
Implications
4
Occupational 
Health & Safety 
and Road Safety
R
Manufacturing: - Improper 
storage of battery cells within 
production facilities posing fire 
hazards. Infrastructure: - Fire 
incidents within the paint shop. 
Logistics: - Road accidents 
involving employees and logistic 
partners. Compliance: - Partial 
non-adherence to TVSM's safety 
standards by contractors.
Financial Impact: - Property 
damage from accidents or incidents. 
Disruptions in operations leading 
to production downtime and lost 
revenue. - Increased insurance costs 
due to higher risk profile. Human 
Cost: - Potential increase in employee 
and workers injuries or casualties
Negative 
Implications
5
Alternative Fuel 
Technology
R
Govt. Policies: The Ministry of 
Petroleum and Natural Gas has 
notified National Policy on Biofuels 
(2018) and series of notification 
in connection to this policy. Under 
this policy, Ethanol Blended Petrol 
Program was launched. The 
Ministry of Petroleum and Natural 
Gas has notified the roadmap 
of Ethanol Blending. By 2025, 
there will be dispense of min. E20 
across the country and there will 
be availability of flex fuel at select 
locations.
Technology Challenges: The 
calorific value of the ethanol is 
lower than that of gasoline. Also, 
the ethanol is aggressive when 
compared to gasoline.
TVSM's is aligned with the roadmap 
introduced by the MoPNG. All the ICE 
products manufactured in FY24 are E20 
material compliant. TVSM showcased 
Raider 125 with Flex Fuel Technology 
at the Bharat Mobility 2024, New Delhi. 
This vehicle can run on any blend of fuel 
from E20 to E85 petrol.
TVSM has carried out series of testing 
and tuned the vehicles to incorporate 
the changes in the properties of the 
fuel used in the vehicles. Few parts 
were also developed to meet the 
material compatibility of the E20 as 
well as Flex fuel vehicle. TVS has 
collaborated external agencies like 
ARAI, IOCL and other academic 
institutes to develop alternate fuel 
based vehicles

Electric Vehicle
R
Govt. Policies: India is a signatory 
to Paris Agreement and India has 
committed to be carbon neutral 
by 2070. India is dependent 
on import of crude oil. GoI has 
notified CAFE norms to curb the 
emissions from the automotive 
sector.
Investment: EV requires huge 
CAPEX investments, R&D, testing 
and manufacturing requirements.
Supply chain: Requires 
development of new supply chain 
as existing suppliers may be 
equipped with the components 
used for ICE products.
Customer acceptance: Due to 
lack of charging infrastructure, 
longer charging time and lower 
range, the acceptance and 
adoption are influenced.
1.	
Govt. is providing incentives 
to the OEMs (PLI schemes) 
as well as to the customers 
(FAME subsidies), to lower the 
investment cost and cost of the 
vehicle to the customer.
2.	
Supply chain: TVSM has 
adopted to the EV and identified 
and developed the suppliers 
accordingly to manufacture the 
EVs smoothly.
3.	
Customer acceptance: TVSM has 
tied up Tata power and Jio-BP 
to create charging infrastructure 
using renewable energy. TVSM 
has introduced fast charger 
option with the EVs which takes 
shorter time for the charging the 
vehicle. Further, TVSM has also 
introduces iQube ST with higher 
range addressing the low range 
anxiety of the customers.
Negative 
Implications
7
Climate Change 
impacts of 
products
R
There are increasing number of 
regulations across geographies 
in relation to emissions and fuel 
use/efficiency. Evolving stringent 
standards require suitable 
modifications in design and 
production process, potentially 
impacting margins. Climate 
change also impacts availability of 
resources such as water.
TVSM has been proactively working 
towards making our products more 
fuel and resource efficient. The 
company has also introduced (and 
continues to expand) a rage of EV 
options.
Negative 
Implications
8
Climate Change 
impacts of 
products
O
Shifting consumer preferences 
towards more eco-friendly 
vehicles creates an opportunity 
for our products. Products such 
as EVs are also (currently) being 
supported by government 
subsidies.
Revenue from new eco-friendly 
products, access to incentives such as 
subsidies and improved operational 
efficiency.
Positive 
Implications
9
Energy & 
emissions 
Management (in 
operations)
R
TVSM has proactively acted 
upon and reduced our direct 
energy consumption and 
resultant emissions. However, 
automobile manufacturing is 
resource intensive, and the 
Company relies on a multitude 
of suppliers for component parts 
and raw materials, resulting 
in substantial indirect energy 
consumption and emissions, over 
which the Company has limited 
control. There is also a trend of 
increasing regulations that require 
management and reporting of 
indirect emissions (and other 
impacts).
The Company's operations have 
significantly reduced fuel consumption 
and increase renewable energy 
consumption. TVSM has initiated 
programs aimed at managing indirect 
emissions and building supplier 
capacity.
Negative 
Implications
10
Resource 
Management
R
The scarcity and fluctuating price 
dynamics of raw materials can 
impact production schedules and 
profit margins.
TVSM enters into long-term supply 
contracts, progressively uses more 
sustainable materials and implements 
recycling programs

Some of the parameters verified for the units under the reporting boundary include: 
•
Employee details
•
Participation / Representation of women
•
Turnover rate for employees & workers
•
CSR details
•
Environmental monitoring parameters including water, wastewater, air emissions, solid waste,
GHG emissions etc.
•
Welfare and OHS data
•
All the parameters in BRSR core
 
The data values for all reported BRSR core parameters were verified by Bureau Veritas through an 
auditing process based on sampling of data records. Sampling was conducted by considering the 
contribution of the individual parameter to the overall organizational sustainability levels. A separate 
verification checklist was also utilized during the assessment. Gaps in data values (GHG related) or any 
other error identified during the data assessment was reported these were then corrected along with 
response by the client and subsequently the reported findings were verified and closed. 
Bureau Veritas has assessed the quantification methodology used by TVS for the monitoring and 
calculations of the various BRSR parameters from its different sources and confirms the same to be 
in line with accepted practice of standard practice. The materiality threshold of 5% has been 
considered in this assessment process. 
The details of the breakdown of data were verified by Bureau Veritas during the physical site visits 
conducted to verify the data. Samples of data were verified during the process to confirm the 
correctness of values considered in the calculations. The primary activity data values used to report in 
the BRSR can be regarded as conservatively considered. 
Our work was conducted against the requirements defined in the guidance document of BRSR along 
with Bureau Veritas' internal standard procedures and guidelines for external Assurance of 
Sustainability Reports, based on current best practice in independent assurance. 
The Bureau Veritas assurance process has also involved an Independent Technical Review (ITR) to 
check for correctness and accuracy of the assurance conclusions as well as adherence to Bureau Veritas 
Internal procedures and/or assurance standard requirements.

in line with the applicable criteria here before stated. The reviewed statements within the scope of 
our verification are transparent and the information included therein are fairly stated. A separate 
report (Management report) has been generated and forwarded to TVS regarding internal processes

TVS has processes in place for engaging with its key stakeholders 
including socially responsible investors, Government officials, local 
community 
representatives 
and 
has 
undertaken 
stakeholder 
engagement activities. The entity is also involved in many CSR projects 
for the local community. 
The BRSR addresses the range of environmental, social and economic 
issues of concern that TVS has identified as being of highest material 
importance. The material issues were identified by a process of 
stakeholder engagement and interaction. The identification of material 
issues has considered both internal assessments of risks and 
opportunities to the business, as well as stakeholders' views and 
concerns. 
TVS is responding to those issues it has identified as material and 
demonstrates this in its policies, objectives, indicators and performance 
targets. The company has taken various initiatives towards delivering 
environmentally friendly services along with occupational health and 
safety, appropriate measures for emergency handling, control and risk 
management in its operations. 
There is no finding from our assessment that TVS has not monitored, 
measured or has not been accountable for its actions related to its 
material topics. 
The reliability of assurance is subject to uncertainty(ies) that are inherent 
in the assurance process. Uncertainties stem from limitations in the 
accounting and quantification models used for various parameters or 
emission factors used or may be present in the estimation of data used 
to arrive at conclusions or results. Our conclusions in respect of this 
assurance are naturally subject to any inherent uncertainty(ies) involved 
in the assurance process.
