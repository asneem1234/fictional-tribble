recovery, and recycling. Net-zero greenhouse gas emission commitments are 
being spear headed by major corporations. Sustainability initiatives, including the

an accelerated pace. The Company believes that human resources are vital to 
the growth and sustainability of an organization as it seeks to maintain a healthy 
work environment at all levels and encourages the employees to do their

1. 	 Boregoan plants and Upcoming project at Assam are on ZLD basis technology. Company has installed the waste heat recovery and Multi 
effect evaporators to treat the ETP treated water for its use in the various process and then final concentrated effluent is being used in 
coal yard for Ash quenching.
2. 	 All mineral processing plants also operate on ZLD basis by using its water in back process. As effluent has the high Ph and less COD. Hence, 
it is good for using in the washing or in back process.
3. 	 Our plants at Muzaffarnagar and Bharuch are having moderated ETP backed by Multieffect evaporators. ETP treated water is being used 
in RO and RO reject is being processed in Multieffect Evaporators. RO reject and other qualified effluent, which is complying with the state 
pollution control board guidelines, are discharged in designated drain. We have the permission of effluent discharge. Hence, all discharge 
qualifies the norms set by the authority.
