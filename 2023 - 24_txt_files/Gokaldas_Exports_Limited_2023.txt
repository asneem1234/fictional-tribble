1.
Climate Change 
and Biodiversity
Risk
Prioritizing climate change and biodiversity 
in the garment manufacturing industry is 
essential for environmental sustainability, 
regulatory compliance, consumer trust, 
risk management, and fostering positive 
community relationships. The apparel 
industry is a significant contributor to 
greenhouse gas emissions, primarily 
through energy-intensive production 
processes and extensive use of synthetic 
materials. By adopting sustainable practices 
such as energy efficiency, renewable energy 
sources, and reducing emissions, companies 
can help combat global warming and 
contribute to global climate goals. Garment 
manufacturing can lead to deforestation, 
habitat destruction, and water pollution, 
all of which threaten biodiversity. 
Implementing practices like sustainable 
sourcing of raw materials, reducing 
chemical use, and ensuring wastewater 
treatment can protect local flora and 
fauna, thereby supporting biodiversity 
conservation.

Risk and  
Opportunity
Water management is a crucial aspect 
of the garment manufacturing industry 
due to its significant impact on both 
operational efficiency and environmental 
sustainability. With increasing global water 
scarcity, industries face growing pressure 
to adopt sustainable practices to optimize 
water usage and reduce waste. Effective 
water management is vital for the industry, 
offering economic benefits, environmental 
protection, and enhanced sustainability, 
while also safeguarding against potential 
operational risks.
1.	 Implementing measures to 
reduce fresh water demand in 
laundry or wet processes
2.	 Maximising water recycling 
potential using ZLD systems
3.	 Installing Low liquor ratio and 
E-Flow laundry machines which 
consumes less water, Chemicals 
and generate low effluents
4.	 Exploring Rain Water Harvesting 
potentials in all units owned by 
the Company
5.	 Explore the possibilities of 
using CETP treated water 
for processing
Negative
4.
Circularity
Opportunity
The apparel industry ecosystem is 
responsible for contributing significantly 
towards climate change, resource 
intensification and biodiversity loss. 
Circularity is crucial in mitigating the 
depletion of finite resources and reducing 
the environmental footprint of garment 
production. It also indicates transition 
from degenerative material life cycle 
to regenerative life cycle. By adopting 
circularity practices, the industry can reduce 
its dependency on virgin resources and 
significantly minimize textile waste ending 
up in landfills. 
1.	 Working on improving 
the design and plotting 
efficiency for reducing waste 
during operations
2.	 Implementing waste segregation 
at the source and continuously 
exploring possibilities 
for upcycling
3.	 Jointly exploring with customers/
buyers the possibilities of 
improving use of recycled 
materials in production
4.	 Planning to increase sourcing 
of recycled raw materials 
(e.g Fabric, Trims. Packaging 
Materials etc.)

5.
Human Capital  
Development
Opportunity
Human capital development is critical in 
labor-intensive manufacturing industries, 
especially where the majority of the 
workforce is women. Investing in the 
education, skills, and well-being of 
employees not only enhances productivity 
but also fosters a more equitable and 
sustainable workplace. When workers feel 
valued and see opportunities for growth, 
they are more likely to be motivated and 
committed to their jobs. This is particularly 
important in labor-intensive industries 
where the work can be repetitive and 
demanding. Focusing on the development 
of female employees can address gender 
disparities and promote inclusivity.
1.	 Investing in creating 
livelihood opportunities 
for under-privileged and 
marginalized communities
2.	 Increasing our efforts in 
providing safe, secure and 
inclusive work environment for 
our workers and employees
3.	 Continuously focusing on 
employee well-being and 
capacity building opportunities 
4.	 Collaborating with external 
agencies to impart training 
and skill to communities 
with an objective of 
enhancing employability 
Positive
6.
Talent and Skill 
Management
Risk and  
Opportunity
Skill development and talent management 
are essential in labor-intensive apparel 
manufacturing sector with a predominantly 
female workforce. For women, who 
may face additional societal barriers to 
education and training, targeted programs 
can bridge skill gaps and empower them 
to advance within the industry. Providing 
workers with continuous training in new 
technologies, processes, and best practices 
can significantly improve the quality and 
productivity. A supportive environment 
that promotes professional development 
can reduce turnover rates and attract 
new talent. Effective talent management 
strategies, such as career development 
programs, mentorship, and leadership 
training, can create pathways for employees 
to advance within the Company.
1.	 Implementing wide range of 
skill development programs for 
workers and employees
2.	 Incorporating dedicated 
soft skills and technical skills 
upliftment for women workers 
and employees 
3.	 Developing and implementing 
career progression roadmaps for 
workers and employees 
4.	 Engaging with workers and 
employees in addressing 
attrition and abseentism
5.	 Implementing programs 
to promote women in 
leadership roles
Positive
7.
Responsible Sourcing  
and SCM
Risk and  
Opportunity
The value chain in the apparel 
manufacturing industry is complex, 
multilayered and geographically dispersed. 
There has been a growing trend and greater 
demand for eco-friendly material, fair trade 
practices and transparent supply chain. 
Responsible sourcing practices are vital due 
to their significant impact on sustainability, 
ethical standards, and compliance 
management. It is critical to ensure that 
ethical labor practices, safe working 
conditions, and quality assurance measures 
are followed by supply chain partners. By 
adopting responsible sourcing, garment 
manufacturers can ensure compliance with 
regulations, and avoid potential disruptions 
to their supply chain.
1.	 Started mapping of suppliers 
and dialogue on issues 
related to environmental and 
social performance
2.	 Developing guidelines on 
responsible sourcing and supply 
chain management
3.	 Initiating traceability and 
transparency programs across 
value chain
Negative
8.
Community  
Engagement
Opportunity
Community engagement fosters trust, 
provides valuable local insights, creates 
beneficial partnerships, and strengthens 
the social license to operate, ultimately 
contributing to sustainable and responsible 
business practices. By demonstrating a 
commitment to social responsibility and 
ethical practices, industry can gain the 
support of local stakeholders, navigating 
regulatory landscapes and ensuring smooth 
operations across different locations. 
Understanding the unique social, cultural, 
and economic dynamics of each community 
allows businesses to tailor community 
development initiatives to better align with 
local values and expectations. This can 
enhance the effectiveness of corporate 
social responsibility (CSR) programs 
and improve the overall impact of the 
Company's efforts.
1. 	 Engaging with local 
communities through CSR 
initiatives like:
•	
Enhancing health 
care facilities
•	
Improving infrastructure of 
education institutions
•	
Setting up skill 
development centers 
•	
Organizing health camps 
and community health 
improvement programs
2.	 Implementing community 
development projects 
focusing on livelihood 
opportunities, agroforestry, 
women empowerment

9.
Grievance  
Redressal
Opportunity
Implementing a robust grievance redressal 
mechanism in a garment manufacturing 
industry is essential for ensuring a safe, 
fair, and productive work environment. 
Such mechanisms ensure that workers and 
employees have a clear and accessible way 
to voice their concerns and complaints. 
This is particularly important for female 
workers who may face unique challenges 
such as gender discrimination, harassment, 
or unequal treatment. Providing a safe 
and confidential platform for reporting 
issues helps in addressing and resolving 
these problems promptly. Appropriate 
grievance redressal system promotes a 
culture of respect and trust. When workers 
and employees know that their concerns 
would be taken seriously and addressed 
appropriately, it builds confidence in the 
management and encourages a more 
open and communicative workplace. By 
proactively resolving complaints, companies 
can retain their workforce, reduce 
absenteeism, and maintain operational 
efficiency.
1.	 Reinforcing existing mechanisms 
and incorporating technological 
interventions for wider reach
2.	 Continuously organizing variety 
of awareness and sensitization 
programs for workers 
and employees
3.	 Improving counselling 
efforts with internal and 
external experts
4.	 Enhancing dedicated human 
resources for grievance redressal
Positive
10.
Health and Safety
Risk
The garment industry often involves various 
tasks which can pose significant health and 
safety risks. It is our prime responsibility 
to provide a healthy and safe workplace 
for all employees. The manufacturing 
operations involve physically demanding 
and repetitive tasks, exposure to chemicals, 
and operating machinery. It is paramount 
to implement and ensure strict health and 
safety standards and provide appropriate 
protective equipment to prevent accidents 
and adverse health issues. When employees 
feel safe and healthy, they are more likely to 
be engaged and efficient in their work. This 
is especially important in a labor-intensive 
industry where the physical and mental 
well-being of the workforce directly impacts 
overall productivity and quality of output. 
1.	 Organizing training and 
awareness on Health and Safety 
for all workers and employees in 
a periodic manner
2.	 Holistically adopting Life and 
Building Safety (LABS) standards 
across our facilities 
3.	 Mimimising the Hazards 
and Risks through continual 
improvement action plans
4.	 Rolling out reward and 
recognition program covering 
all employees
