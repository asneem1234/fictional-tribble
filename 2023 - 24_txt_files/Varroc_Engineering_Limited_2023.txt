Yes, our team leads impactful GHG emission reduction projects, targeting key areas of energy conservation. We have 
carried out various projects to improve energy efficiency and reduce GHG emissions. Some thematic areas include:
	
1.	
Implementation of energy efficiency and conservation programs at all our manufacturing plants: we conduct 
energy audits each year for all the plants to identify opportunities of reducing consumption in the areas of 
compressed air systems, furnace heat loss, energy efficient lightings, etc. We are targeting 3% reduction in total 
energy consumption through the energy audits.
	
2.	
Renewable Energy Penetration: we have installed solar rooftop systems in more than 50% of our plants and 
plan to increase the capacity at all the plants in the coming years. We are also identifying new opportunities to 
expand the Solar/Wind Captive generation capacity.
	
3.	
Environmental Management Systems (EMS): we have implemented an online EMS which helps us track the 
energy consumption specifically for our products and optimize wherever possible.
	
4.	
Optimizing the value chain logistics to reduce our fuel consumption.

We have adopted waste management practices as per the statutory/regulatory requirements. For managing all the 
waste coming from the operations, we have clearly bifurcated the hazardous and non-hazardous waste categories 
and separate collection bins are installed at each shop/cell. Waste remains segregated at all times, including during 
transit from floor to the storage and within the storage area. Relevant vendors have been identified and authorized 
to safety and sustainably manage the waste. All waste except E-waste is disposed within 90 days.

Describe the mechanisms to receive and redress grievances of the community.
	
Since our beginnings, we have consciously and consistently intended to focus on the true CSR concept of protecting 
the communities we work in. We have identified our focus areas by considering three areas: promoting inclusivity, 
providing opportunities for social mobility, and empowering the community. Details of our CSR initiatives have been 
outlined in our Annual Report and Sustainability Report but briefly, we focus on youth empowerment in professional 
youth sports, in biodiversity conservation alongside our long-term dedicated partner EcoSattva who focuses on 
conservation through community engagement, and vocational education specifically to support the growing need 
for talent within the manufacturing industry through our tie up with TISS’s bachelor’s degree programmes. Grievance 
redressal mechanisms for these initiatives specifically are available through dedicated POCs for each project.
