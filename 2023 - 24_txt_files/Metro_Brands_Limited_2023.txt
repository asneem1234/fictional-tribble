Opportunity
Footwear made from diverse 
raw materials poses a significant 
recycling challenge once 
discarded, leading to decades-
long persistence in landfills, 
contaminating soil and water, 
and harming the environment
MBL’s sustainability efforts 
diverted 1,941 tons of used 
footwear from landfills, with 
48.06% recycled and 51.93% co-
processed at a waste-to-energy 
plant, following CPCB guidelines 
for an eco-friendly outcome.
Positive Implication
Efficient 
Resource Use
Opportunity
Resource efficiency provides 
opportunities to reduce 
operational costs, enhance 
competitive advantage, and 
comply with regulations, while 
also boosting brand reputation 
and attracting investment. It 
aligns with sustainability goals, 
appealing to eco-conscious 
consumers and fostering 
innovation.
MBL has installed solar power 
systems with capacities of 110 kW 
and 130 kW at its two warehouses 
in Bhiwandi, generating a total 
of 254,467 units of renewable 
energy during the fiscal year 
2023-24. This transition to solar 
energy plays a crucial role in 
reducing the Company’s carbon 
footprint by lowering its reliance 
on fossil fuels.

Metro Brands Ltd.’s Sustainable Footwear 
Processing Initiative: Diverted 1,941 tonnes 
of Old Footwear from Landfills
Metro Brands Ltd. addresses 
critical climate and environmental 
challenges posed by the footwear 
industry’s rapid expansion through 
the processing of old, discarded 
footwear (ODF). With annual global 
footwear production reaching 21 
billion pairs, improper disposal 
leads to significant environmental 
degradation. Our initiative aims 
to mitigate this by collaborating 
with social enterprises and NGOs, 
meticulously sorting collected ODF, 
and recycling materials like plastic 
and rubber. We repurpose worn-off 
components as coal substitutes in 
cement kilns and power generation, 
reducing costs and emissions.
This project not only empowers 
ragpickers with increased income 
but also fosters business growth, 
job creation, resource conservation, 
and emission reduction. Our 
commitment to eco-consciousness 
enhances our CSR reputation, 
promotes ethical consumption, 
and sets a pioneering model for 
sustainable industry practices.

Empowering the Cobbler Communities: 
Enrolling 7,000 Cobblers in Various 
Government of India Benefit Schemes
Cobblers are vital stakeholders 
in our business but often receive 
minimal benefits from our activities. 
To address this, our CSR initiative 
aims to empower and support 
this community. Partnering with 
Renovate India, we educated and 
assisted over 7,000 cobblers in 
enrolling in various Government of 
India benefit schemes. Additionally, 
in collaboration with Prince Aly Khan 
Hospital, we organized 24 health 
camps across the MMR region, 
focusing on awareness and early 
detection of hypertension, diabetes, 
and oral cancer. These camps 
saw participation from over 1,400 
cobblers. Through these initiatives, 
we are committed to supporting and 
uplifting the cobbler community, 
ensuring they receive the care and 
benefits they need.

Footwear for a Brighter Future:  
3,684 Pairs of Footwear Distributed to 
Underprivileged Children
Despite the footwear industry 
producing 21 billion pairs annually, 
1.5 billion people suffer from 
illnesses due to inadequate 
footwear. Our partnership with 
Renovate India and Catalyst 
for Social Action enabled 
us to distribute footwear to 
underprivileged beneficiaries 
across four states. These in-kind 
donations aimed to alleviate health 
issues and improve quality of life 
for those in need. By bridging the 
gap between the privileged and the 
underprivileged, we strive to create 
a more equitable society. Through 
this initiative, we brought smiles 
to the faces of 3,684 individuals, 
underscoring our commitment 
to social responsibility and 
community empowerment.

The Company calculated Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions for two offices in Mumbai, two warehouses in Bhiwandi, and 836 
showrooms across India. Emissions from purchased electricity and fuel consumption were considered for Scope 1 and Scope 2 
calculations. The latest emission factor from the Central Electricity Authority of India (CEA) was used for purchased electricity. 
Scope 1 and Scope 2 intensity per rupee of turnover, adjusted for Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), was calculated using India’s 
2024 PPP factor of 22.17, sourced from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). For the fiscal year 2023-2024, the Company has 
successfully determined its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emission figures for the first time. Consequently, there are no comparable figures 
available for the previous year.
3.6.1.8	 Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details.
Yes, the Company is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions through several key initiatives. It has installed solar power 
systems with capacities of 110 kW and 130 kW at its two warehouses in Bhiwandi, generating a total of 254,467 units of renewable 
energy during the fiscal year 2023-24. This transition to solar energy plays a crucial role in reducing the Company’s carbon footprint 
by lowering its reliance on fossil fuels. Additionally, MBL has successfully diverted 1,941 tonnes of old footwear from landfills. 
This effort not only mitigates waste but also reduces greenhouse gas emissions associated with landfill decomposition and the 
production of new materials. By repurposing this waste, the Company exemplifies how waste management challenges can be 
transformed into innovative solutions for reducing environmental impact and promoting sustainability.
