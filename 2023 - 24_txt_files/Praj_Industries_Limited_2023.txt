Development of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) was carried out 
using combination of fermentation and catalytic process starting with 
renewable feed stock, sugar cane molasses. Use of this SAF will have 
almost 40% GHG reduction over conventional fossil jet fuel.
Development and deployment of compressed biogas (RNG) or renewable 
natural gas from biomass residues was done from bench (1 kg/day 
biomass) to pilot (60 kg/day biomass) to now commercial scale (200 
MT/day). The use of CBG in transportation fuel will reduce the overall 
carbon emissions by 80% over fossil-based NG.
Development of biodegradable plastics (poly lactic acid and poly hydroxy 
alkenoate) is at bench scale and a pilot plant is being built to demonstrate 
the technology at 100 MTA scale. This development will address the 
issue of single use plastic menace polluting the environment.
