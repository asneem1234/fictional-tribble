We have integrated an Occupational Health and Safety Management system into our business operations, which 
is guided by our comprehensive Environment, Health, and Safety (EHS) policy. To ensure the effectiveness of our EHS 
program, we allocate the necessary resources and support for relevant initiatives and programs and align them with our 
business objectives and compliance requirements. We continuously incorporate EHS objectives into our business planning, 
performance tracking, and governance processes to ensure a safety-focused culture throughout the organization. We 
strive to achieve an incident-free workplace by fostering a safety culture at all levels of the organization through various 
safety trainings, initiatives, mock drills, and campaigns.

b.	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by the 
entity? 
	
	
All health, safety, and environmental hazards are assessed, and corrective actions are implemented during the development 
and manufacturing stages. Process safety is ensured throughout the entire product lifecycle, starting from the design 
stage, supported by periodic assessments and monitoring.
	
	
Safe operations are maintained using various risk analysis tools, including EHS by design checklists, risk-based exposure 
assessments for all chemicals, Hazard and Operability Analysis (HAZOP), Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment 
(HIRA), Qualitative Risk Analysis (QRA), walkthrough observations, plant safety inspections, and internal and external 
safety audits. The company routinely and non-routinely identifies work-related hazards and assesses risks. Routine 
activities are covered under HIRA and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), while non-routine activities are managed 
through the work permit system. Any changes in processes or facilities are addressed through the Change Management 
System to ensure a safe workplace. Furthermore, our site leadership teams actively identify unsafe acts and conditions. To 
protect our employees from hazards, we enforce stringent administrative and engineering controls, a work permit system, 
and ensure a trained workforce equipped with appropriate personal protective equipment across all facilities.
	
c.	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such risks. (Yes/ No)
	
	
Yes, fostering a safety-oriented mindset within our workforce is fundamental to our safety management system. Our 
interventions emphasize employee consultation, participation, and involvement in cultivating a robust safety culture. 
We have adopted a blended approach that includes both informal interventions, such as toolbox talks, and formalized 
procedures. Employees are encouraged to proactively incorporate safety into their daily activities. They are also 
encouraged to report unsafe acts, unsafe conditions, and near misses, and to offer suggestions for improving workplace 
safety and health. The company provides a supportive working environment that empowers employees to implement 
innovative ideas.
	
d.	
Do the employees/ worker of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services? (Yes/ No).

12.	 Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy workplace.
	
As a pharmaceutical company, we are committed to providing a safe and healthy work environment for our employees. To 
achieve this, we are implementing the ISO 45001-2018 Occupational Health and Safety Management System across all our 
business units. This comprehensive system ensures that we identify and manage risks, hazards, and unsafe conditions across all 
aspects of our operations.
	
To identify potential hazards and assess risks, we conduct regular Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA) exercises 
for all activities and processes. Based on the findings, we implement appropriate control measures to minimize the risks and 
ensure a safe working environment. To control process and fugitive emissions, we have installed adequate scrubber systems 
across our plants. These systems help reduce the risk of emissions and ensure a safe working environment. All facilities are 
protected with required fire protection systems.
	
We ensure the safety of our employees, by conducting regular plant safety inspections by cross-functional teams and external 
agencies. These inspections help us identify areas of improvement and take corrective actions to address any safety concerns. 
Required Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs) are provided for all employees and workers. In addition, we conduct exposure 
assessments and Leak Detection and Repair (LDAR) studies to monitor the potential risks associated with our processes 
and operations. 
	
To ensure the well-being of our employees, we conduct annual medical health checks. We have a tie-up with NANO Health 
CARE, a reputed healthcare provider, to provide comprehensive medical check-ups for our employees. This helps us monitor their 
health and address any health concerns in a timely manner. We also conduct regular health and safety trainings and awareness 
campaigns for our employees. Employees also undergo various mock drills on various scenarios such as chemical spill, fire, etc. 
	
Periodically, we identify and eliminate unsafe conditions and acts in our plants. This helps us maintain a safe and healthy work 
environment for our employees.

Natco Pharma is committed to reducing its carbon footprint and contributing to a more sustainable future. In line with this 
commitment, we aim to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across our operations. This focuses on identifying and 
implementing energy-efficient technologies and practices, such as upgrading to energy-efficient lighting and machinery, 
implementing renewable energy sources, using briquette-based boilers rather than fuel oil-based boilers to reduce our 
greenhouse gas emissions and optimizing energy consumption through energy management systems. At our Dehradun plant, 
Air handling units have been installed instead of DX units and Air Conditioners, and HEPA filters have been installed to prevent 
the process emissions. Chennai plant has installed AHU Condensate Collection tank to collect and reuse the AHU condensate 
water for cooling tower make up, which resulted in 550KL of water collection and reuse in the reporting year. In FY 2023-24, the

For hazardous wastes, we work with authorized cement industries for co-processing or sends them to authorized pre-processing 
facilities for treatment before co-processing in cement kilns or safe disposal in TSDFs (Treatment, Storage, and Disposal 
Facilities). Additionally, the company sends organic liquid and solid wastes, spent carbon, dried ETP sludge, and inorganic 
solid wastes to authorized cement industries for co-processing. Used oil and e-waste are directed to authorized re-processors 
and recycling/dismantling facilities, respectively. Used batteries are sent to authorized recyclers or returned to manufacturers 
through a buy-back program.
	
For non-hazardous wastes, Natco Pharma sends garbage/general waste (combustible) to authorized pre-processing facilities 
for initial processing before co-processing in cement kilns. At our Research Center, paper waste is sent to ITC for recycling, 
while metal scrap (SS/MS) is sent to recyclers. HDPE carboys/drums are sent to end users or recyclers, and glass waste is sent to 
recyclers. Biodegradable waste from the canteen is converted into compost using organic waste converters, which is then used 
as manure for the green belt. Further, Effluent treatment/Sewage treatment plants are in place for neutralisation of wastewater 
generated from process operations.
	
By following these waste management practices, we ensure the safe disposal of all types of waste while also promoting 
sustainability and environmental protection.
