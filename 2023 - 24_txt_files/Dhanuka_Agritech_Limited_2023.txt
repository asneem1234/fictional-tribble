Risk & 
Opportunity 
Risk: The world's 
population is expected to 
grow to 9.71 billion by 
2050. Meeting the food 
security needs of over 9 
billion people will be a 
substantial challenge.                                              
Opportunity: Our approach 
to tackling this challenge 
involves enhancing crop 
yields and ensuring the 
production of safer food, 
thereby securing food 
resources for the expanding 
population. 
The Company's philosophy is to 
collaborate with innovators, parti-
cularly Japanese companies, to 
introduce new products that are safe 
for use within permissible limits, 
environmentally friendly, and have 
minimal residues, beneting the 
Indian farming community. 
Environmental considerations are 
integrated into every proposal through 
hazard analysis and what-if analysis. 
We work closely with farmers to 
improve yield and enhance 
productivity, directing all our efforts 
toward their enrichment.

Sustainable 
Products 
Risk 
The Agrochemical sector 
faces signicant risks 
related to product quality 
and safety, making it 
imperative to prioritize 
responsibilities associated 
with product integrity. 
Comprehensive risk 
analysis and subsequent 
mitigation strategies adhere 
closely to the stringent 
standards and guidelines 
set forth by regulatory 
bodies. This approach 
specically emphasizes 
responsible usage of 
pesticides, fungicides, 
insecticides, and other 
proprietary products, 
ensuring alignment with 
core governance standards. 
Dhanuka Group's diverse product 
portfolio addresses both social and 
environmental concerns while 
presenting opportunities for 
sustainable agriculture. Products like 
Suelo, MYCORe, PGR's, and BiologiQ 
are designed to enhance soil health, 
promote bio-fertilization, regulate 
plant growth, and provide sustainable 
insecticide, fungicide, and plant 
nutrition solutions. These offerings 
underscore Dhanuka's commitment to 
ecological responsibility and farmer 
empowerment. 
Through extensive outreach efforts, 
Dhanuka educates farmers nationwide 
on modern agricultural practices, 
fostering partnerships with SAUs, 
ICAR Institutes, and KVKs. This 
initiative enhances productivity while 
conserving energy and water 
Positive: Ensuring 
compliance with all 
relevant regulatory 
standards regarding 
product quality and 
safety underscores 
the Company's 
steadfast dedication 
and integrity in 
safeguarding crop 
health. 
Negative: Failure to 
address signicant 
issues related to 
product safety and 
quality may result in 
penalties and 
warnings issued by 
regulatory 
authorities. 
Additionally, such

resources. Seed treatment machines 
delivered directly to farmers' doorsteps 
and on-farm demonstrations further 
illustrate Dhanuka's hands-on 
approach to improving agricultural 
techniques. 
At its R&D facility in Palwal, Haryana, 
Dhanuka conducts advanced soil 
testing to tailor agricultural recom-
mendations to specic soil conditions. 
Advocating for responsible pesticide 
use, the company emphasizes safe 
application methods and provides 
training to enhance operational skills 
and safety measures. 
Dhanuka actively addresses water 
scarcity by promoting pond creation 
and check-dam construction in 
Rajasthan, bolstering water con-
servation efforts and supporting 
sustainable farming practices. 
Additionally, the company educates 
farmers about crop insurance through 
regular advisories and integrates these 
insights into various eld 
engagements.

hazardous waste. It is 
crucial to prioritize reducing 
waste generation, recycling,

Water Use & 
Management 
Risk & 
Opportunity 
Risk: Water has been 
identied as a critical 
material issue under envir-
onmental risk. Addressing 
these environmental risks 
underscores the Company's 
climate consciousness and 
its role in developing 
mitigation action plans 
against climate change. 
Opportunity: Implementing 
comprehensive water 
management plans aligned 
with the Company's 
environmental conservation 
strategy will highlight our 
commitment to water 
preservation and climate 
change mitigation. Ensuring 
access to clean and safe 
water, a basic human right, 
aligns with the United 
Nations Sustainable 
Development Goal 6, to be 
achieved by 2030. As a 
responsible corporate 
citizen, we ensure that our 
operations do not negatively 
To address concerns about global 
warming, Dhanuka Agritech Ltd. 
launched a campaign focused on 
encouraging people to save at least 
one liter of water daily. The engaging 
content, which emphasized returning 
water to farmers for a better future, 
was well-received by Dhanuka's social 
media followers. This and similar 
campaigns achieved signicant reach 
on social media platforms, 
establishing a strong digital presence 
for Dhanuka. 
Additionally, Dhanuka's leader-ship 
coined the slogan "Gaon ka paani, 
gaon mein aur Khet ka pani, khet 
mein" to raise awareness about water 
conservation. 
Positive: The 
Company's focus on 
enhancing climate 
and ESG-specic 
initiatives boosts 
long-term value 
creation and enables 
an effective response 
to increasing 
stakeholder 
demands. 
Negative: The

ESG awareness and 
address climate

Risk 
The risk associated with 
ESG compliance stems 
from potential non-
adherence to regulatory

particularly concerning crop

adverse product impacts on 
crops. 
The Company is dedicated to 
sustainable growth, prioritizing social 
and environmental responsibility while 
addressing the interests of its key 
stake-holders. In accordance with the 
SEBI (Listing Obligations and Dis-
closure Requirements) Regulations, 
2015, we have implemented a 
Whistle-blower Policy. This policy 
serves as a mechanism for employees, 
suppliers, contractors, and others to 
report concerns related to unethical 
behaviour or suspected fraud, whether 
involving the Company or abuse of 
authority, either anonymously or by a 
named complainant. This initiative 
enhances corporate governance 
practices and is accessible on the 
Company's website. 
Positive: Compliance 
with relevant 
regulatory require-
ments pertaining to 
the GSE domain 
reects the 
Company's commit-

responsible business

Negative: Non-
compliance with 
ESG and regulatory 
requirements, may 
affect the Company's 
image and impact its 
business continuity 
in the long term.

Statement by director responsible for the business 
responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, 
targets and achievements (listed entity has exibility 
regarding the placement of this disclosure) 
The narrative of Indian agriculture is also continuously changing, with 
increasing digitalization, technology, and research. Farmers can now use 
simple tools to receive timely updates and relevant information. Farming is 
sensitive to short-term and long-term climate changes. From soil issues, 
climate, weather prediction, and sustainable irrigation to supply chain 
gaps, better yield, and higher incomes, today's technology can address 
most of the farmer's challenges. Dhanuka is working on these issues and 
spreading information amongst farmers. Dhanuka is regularly encouraging 
good agricultural practices such as the use of modern technologies, 
optimum use of fertilizers and green manure according to soil test reports

(Yes/No): Yes 
In FY 23-24, Dhanuka Agritech has intensied its commitment to environmental 
stewardship by signicantly advancing its initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions and promote sustainability across its operations. Building upon its strong 
foundation of eco-friendly practices, Dhanuka Agritech has implemented several new 
strategies and expanded existing efforts to achieve even greater environmental impact. 
A key area of progress has been the expansion of renewable energy infrastructure. 
Dhanuka Agritech has further increased its investment in solar energy, substantially 
reducing dependency on conventional power sources and thereby lowering carbon 
emissions associated with its operations. This transition not only aligns with global 
sustainability goals but also underscores Dhanuka Agritech's leadership in integrating 
renewable energy into agricultural practices. 
Moreover, Dhanuka Agritech has enhanced its wastewater management systems to 
minimize environmental impact. Building on its existing Efuent Treatment Plant (ETP) 
and Sewage Treatment Plant (STP), the company has implemented advanced 
technologies to ensure comprehensive treatment of industrial and domestic efuents 
throughout their facilities. The treated water is efciently reused for gardening and other 
non-potable purposes, conserving freshwater resources, supporting local ecosystem 
health, and recharging the groundwater. 
Furthermore, Dhanuka Agritech has implemented Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) units 
across its facilities, ensuring that all liquid efuents are treated and reused within the 
production process, leaving no discharge to external water bodies. This initiative 
underscores their commitment to sustainable water management practices and 
environmental conservation. 
Additionally, Dhanuka Agritech has partnered with third-party vendors to responsibly 
manage non-hazardous waste generated at their facilities. These collaborations ensure 
that waste materials are recycled efciently, further reducing environmental footprint and 
promoting circular economy principles within the company's operations.

Briey describe the waste management 
practices adopted in your establishments. 
Describe the strategy adopted by your 
company to reduce usage of hazardous and 
toxic chemicals in your products 
and 
processes and the practices adopted to 
manage such wastes. 
At Dhanuka Agritech, our waste management practices are integral to our 
commitment to sustainability and environmental responsibility. Across our facilities, 
including at Keshwana, Sanand, Dahej, and Udhampur units, we have implemented 
comprehensive strategies aimed at minimizing waste generation and optimizing 
resource utilization. 
To reduce the usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in our products and processes, 
we have adopted stringent measures. Our approach includes rigorous screening of 
raw materials to ensure compliance with safety and environmental standards. We 
actively seek alternative ingredients that are less harmful without compromising 
product quality or efcacy. This proactive stance is supported by our continuous 
improvement initiatives and adherence to ISO 9001:2015, ISO 14001:2015, and 
OHSAS 45001:2018 certications across all our locations. 
In managing waste generated from our operations, particularly at our Keshwana unit, 
we have implemented advanced systems. This includes the installation of an Efuent 
Treatment Plant (ETP) for industrial efuent and a Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) for 
domestic efuent. Treated water from these plants is efciently reused, primarily for 
gardening purposes, thereby conserving water resources. We closely monitor water 
consumption through calibrated ow meters to ensure optimal usage. 
Furthermore, we have implemented rainwater harvesting systems across our facilities 
to capture and utilize rainwater effectively. This initiative not only helps in 
maintaining groundwater levels but also reduces dependency on external water 
sources. The harvested rainwater undergoes initial treatment in our ETP to ensure 
quality standards are met before reuse. 
In our commitment to air quality management, we have installed scrubbers that 
effectively remove contaminants from plant emissions. This proactive approach not 
only minimizes environmental impact but also ensures a healthier workplace 
environment for our employees.

Business Continuity Plans (BCP) are essential for ensuring that a company can recover from 
disruptions in production activities. For manufacturing plants, the specic objectives of BCP 
include identifying various threats that could interrupt business operations. It involves 
establishing advanced arrangements and procedures that enable rapid response to 
emergencies, ensuring the continuous operation of critical business functions. The plan aims 
to minimize employee injuries, prevent loss of life, and reduce damage and losses. It also 
focuses on protecting essential facilities, equipment, vital records, and other assets. 
BCP requires identifying crisis response teams and outlining their specic responsibilities. 
Effective decision-making processes are crucial to restoring operations promptly. The plan 
includes identifying alternative actions to mitigate or minimize the effects of the crisis and 
shorten response times. It quanties the potential impact of various events in terms of 
nancial loss, time, business disruption, and workforce impact. The goal is to ensure a swift 
recovery from emergencies and the timely resumption of full-scale manufacturing. 
Additionally, maintaining the quality of products, protecting the customer base, and preserving 
the company’s brand during emergencies are critical components of the plan.
