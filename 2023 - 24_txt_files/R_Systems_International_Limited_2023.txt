Looking back on a year of transformation and growth
Dear Stakeholders,
On behalf of the entire team at

Creators in India for 2023. This honor 
is a reflection of our unwavering 
commitment to creating value. It 
exemplifies our constant pursuit 
of innovation and excellence in all 
aspects of our business. 
Strategic Realignment and 
Growth
During the year gone by, we 
have successfully realigned our

competitive edge in the volatile markets. 
R Systems embeds Gen AI capabilities in our analytics 
solutions that help our clients achieve their Objectives 
and Key Results (OKRs). Transforming data into 
actionable intelligence, we equip our clients to leverage 
Gen AI to ask deeper questions and drill further into their

optimizes cloud infrastructure to handle varying 
loads, especially during peak shopping periods. This 
capability ensures seamless customer experiences, 
higher transaction success rates, and robust system 
performance, ultimately boosting customer loyalty 
and business growth.
Automation and Digital Ops
Gen AI has fundamentally redefined Automation

adaptive systems that significantly boost both 
efficiency and precision. 
This transformation is reshaping how enterprises 
manage operations, leading to substantial reductions 
in operational costs and notable enhancements in

intricate yet repeatable tasks and workflows with 
accuracy, which speeds up operations and maintains 
consistent quality and compliance across our clients’ 
digital value chain. Our automation experts at R Systems

Risk Management Report
The Management cautions readers that the risks outlined in this 
report are not exhaustive, are for information purposes only and 
may contain forward looking statements, the results of which 
may differ materially from those reflected. Investors and readers 
are requested to exercise their own judgment in assessing various 
risks associated with the Company.
OVERVIEW
Risk Management is a dynamic process which should constantly 
be able to identify all the emerging risks and propose solutions 
to manage them. The risk perception also constantly varies 
depending on the size of the business, business segment, location, 
scale of business. The essence of risk management strategy at 
R Systems lies in maximising areas of control over outcome 
and minimising areas where the Company has no control over 
outcome. R Systems recognizes that business conditions are 
constantly changing, evolving, and entering into cycles. Following 
is the  model  adopted  by  the  Company  for managing risk:
ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE
Risk management is an integral part of the charter of the Board of 
Directors at R Systems. The Board is responsible for monitoring 
risk levels on various parameters and to suggest measures 
to address the same. The day to day management of the risk 
is entrusted to the management team of R Systems. Based 
on the philosophy of “No risks, No rewards”, our management 
continuously keeps monitoring the level of our existence on the 
path of growth and within R Systems management structure, 
certain personnel are designated with responsibility of managing 
risks including ensuring compliance with laws, rules and 
regulations with the assistance of both internal and external 
resources. Further, formal reporting, escalation of risk events and 
control mechanisms ensure timely communication, response 
and proactive management of the risks.
RISK MANAGEMENT AT R SYSTEMS
1.	
Customer Concentration
	
R Systems revenues are dependent to a considerable extent 
upon relationships with a limited number of customers 
and retaining those customers. The percentage of total 
consolidated revenues during fiscal year 2023 and 2022 
that R Systems derived from contracts with its top line 
customers is as follow:
Customer

31, 2023

16.87%
15.25%
Top 3 
12.73%
11.59%
The Largest Customer
6.55%
6.66%
	
Concentration of revenues from a limited number of 
customers deepens our relationship with those customers 
but at the same time imposes a risk of dependence. 
Customer’s vendor management strategies and business 
risks radiate on to R Systems through fluctuations in 
utilization, pricing for services and service level demands. 
All these factors could potentially impact revenues and 
profitability of R Systems.
	
INITIATIVES: The business model and strategy followed by 
R Systems involves serving the customers in a manner that 
they get measurable tangible benefits. When customers see 
value in the services/solutions that R Systems provides, we 
believe that customer’s relationship can be nurtured into 
the long term. Further, with our proactive strategy of adding 
new customers, we attempt to reduce our dependency on a 
smaller number of customer relationships.
2.	
Geographical Concentration
	
R Systems has traditionally derived most of its revenues from 
the North America, given the technology focus and specialized 
outsourced product development services offered by it. The 
geographic break-up of the revenue is given below:

concentration, R Systems has stepped up its business 
activities 
in 
other 
geographic 
areas 
like 
Europe, 
South East Asia etc.
3.	
Risks Associated with Fixed Price Contracts	
	
Under our product engineering and digital offerings most 
of our assignments are on the basis of time and material 
task orders, some proportion of the services provided by us 
is in the nature of fixed bid assignments. Under fixed bid 
assignments, in the event of cost overruns, our profitability 
will be adversely affected.

INITIATIVES: We have our internal processes to ensure 
accuracy in the estimation of the time required to execute 
fixed price projects, and processes to implement and monitor 
the progress of such projects. Further, the experience 
gained from such projects is also used for new projects. 
However, given the very nature of the fixed price projects, 
cost overruns and delayed deliveries cannot be ruled out.
4.	
Competition
	
The IT & ITES sector is a highly competitive sector. Our 
competitors include IT outsourcing firms in India as well 
as in other countries, national and multinational consulting 
and technology firms, Indian IT services firms, software 
firms and in-house IT departments of large companies. 
The competition in the IT industry is very intense and our 
competitors are aggressive in winning new business and 
customers that may drive a harder bargain.
	
INITIATIVES: We believe that R Systems is well positioned 
and enjoys following competitive advantages: 
 
 
Experience in providing end-to-end solutions and 
services to customers;  
 
 
Unique and proprietary   & with best practices, tools 
and methodologies for flawless execution;
 
 
Investment in processes, talent and methodologies;
 
 
Strong customer franchise consisting of large and 
mid-sized corporations;
 
 
Strong financial position;
 
 
Proven global delivery model;
 
 
Our vertical focus for services and solutions;
 
 
Industry best human resource practices to attract, 
develop, deploy and retain talent.	
5.	
Disaster Prevention and Recovery
	
The IT industry is very sensitive to security risk and a real 
or perceived threat of a risk to the security and integrity of 
information available to us may adversely affect customer 
perception, give rise to litigation and reduce our customer 
base, thereby negatively affecting R Systems revenues and 
profit margins. The contracts entered into by R Systems 
typically hold us solely responsible for maintaining 
satisfactory standards of personnel competency, conduct 
and integrity and for taking required disciplinary action.
	
R Systems may be vulnerable to risks due to natural 
or manmade calamities / disasters which may impact 
business operations, inflicting heavy economic losses and 
risk to employee safety.
    INITIATIVES: R Systems has adopted industry-standard 
security precautions such as ensuring that our employees 
and strategic partners enter into non-disclosure and 
confidentiality agreements with us, verifying that there is 
no information leakage through test procedures, carrying 
out background checks and verifications, creating and 
maintaining data backups, and maintaining an adequate 
disaster recovery plan. R Systems makes continual 
investments in organisation behaviour and management 
processes to ensure that these certified industry standards 
are continually adhered to.
	
During the year 2023, Noida IT as well as Knowledge 
Services Division were undergone surveillance audits for 
ISO 9001 and ISO 27001. As of the date of this report, 
Noida IT division and Knowledge Services (KS) Division are 
PCMM Level 5, ISO 9001:2015, ISO 27001:2013 certified 
and HIPAA compliant.  Apart from this, KS division is also 
PCI-DSS (ver.3.2.1) certified (for IT Infrastructure along with 
the projects/ process/ applications in scope).
	
The 
continuing 
compliance 
with 
these 
standards 
demonstrates the rigor of R Systems processes and 
differentiates us to keep our competitive edge in service and 
product offerings.
	
Further, our distributed offshore and near shore infrastructure 
is seamlessly connected through a strong infrastructure 
design and appropriate bandwidth that provides us the 
capability to initiate and maintain uninterrupted support 
across the world.
     Infrastructure redundancy, intra / inter-city recovery sites, 
work-from-home, onsite and split-site operations.  Further, 
our distributed offshore and near shore infrastructure is 
seamlessly connected through a strong infrastructure 
design and appropriate bandwidth, work from home facility 
for employees that provides us the capability to initiate and 
maintain uninterrupted support across the world. Although 
the Company cannot avoid such risk that could impact 
the entire Industry, the Company has taken appropriate 
insurance cover for hazard events.
6.	
Talent Acquisition & Retention
	
The IT and BPO sector is highly competitive in terms of hiring 
strategy and incentives. R Systems is highly dependent on 
its employees at various levels of the organisation to provide 
leadership, manage the business, to provide services and 
execute complex projects for the clients. These skilled 
professionals are in high demand by other organisations 
and if  R Systems is unable to attract and retain the skilled 
people, it will affect R Systems ability to grow and provide 
services to its customers.
	
INITIATIVES: At R Systems, we follow industry best human 
resource practices such as PCMM level 5 to attract, develop, 
deploy and retain talent. The Company is committed to 
develop and innovate such programmes that motivates 
them and develop their potential and also inculcate 
leadership attributes of the employees, which helps us to 
retain the best talent in the industry.

Key Managerial Role & Succession Planning 
	
Succession planning is one of the most critical functions of 
an organization. This is the process that identifies the critical 
and core roles of an organization and identifies and assesses 
the suitable candidates for the same. The process ramps up 
potential candidates with appropriate skills and experiences 
in an effort to train them to handle future responsibilities in 
their respective roles. Succession planning is applicable for 
all critical roles in any organization. The upper management 
of each practice or department is responsible for coming up 
with a suitable succession plan for each core position under 
his or her department.
	
INITIATIVES: R Systems being a CMMI Level 5 
(Ver. 1.3) and PCMM Level 5 company has put in practice a 
well-documented and defined policy on Succession 
Planning. This applies to all key roles in the organization 
as agreed upon by the Senior Management. Mission 
critical and key roles include Chief Executive Officer, Senior 
Management Team comprising of VPs and other roles 
critical to business operations continuity. Succession 
planning at R Systems occurs at least on an annual basis 
during annual performance appraisal cycle.
	
Further, R Systems has extensive recruitment teams in 
the markets that operate to continuously recruit skilled 
personnel at various levels in the organisation. In addition, 
R Systems conducts a rigorous training program at the entry 
level to train new professionals and develop next generation 
of managers and leaders. R Systems deploys modern HR 
practices by offering competitive compensation and benefit 
packages and exciting work environment to attract and retain 
talent. Further, R Systems tries to mitigate the impact of attrition 
in the continuity of services to the clients by using its proprietary 
processes and methodologies that allows the project teams to 
seamlessly share knowledge and collaborate on projects.
8.	
Technological Obsolescence
	
The IT and ITES sector is characterised by technological 
changes at a rapid rate, evolution of existing products 
and introduction of new products. R Systems makes 
investments in R&D with a view to keep pace with the 
latest developments in the technology space. Further, 
R Systems regularly hires, trains and nurtures domain and 
market specialists and continuously evaluates increasing 
the portfolio of technology alliances and partnerships 
to enrich our product and service mix. However, this risk 
cannot be fully mitigated despite the proactive investments 
made by R Systems.
	
INITIATIVES: We continuously enhance our competencies 
around latest technologies to deliver state of art Product 
and Solution for our customers.
9.	
Acquisitions
	
R Systems’ growth strategy involves future strategic 
acquisitions, partnerships and exploration of mutual 
interests with other parties. These future acquisitions may 
not contribute to our profitability, and we may be required 
to incur or assume debt, or assume contingent liabilities, 
as part of any acquisition. We could have difficulty in 
assimilating the personnel, operations, software assets and 
technology of the acquired company. These difficulties could 
disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and 
employees and increase our expenses.
	
INITIATIVES: R Systems will remain sharply focused on those 
acquisitions and partnerships that add to the competitive 
strengths of our business. Specific transactions are 
evaluated in detail with experienced internal personnel and 
external advisors, wherever relevant, before consummating 
any transaction. Deal teams conduct technical, operational, 
marketing due diligence and build detailed financial model 
to evaluate the risks and benefits of any transaction. Further, 
contractual agreements are negotiated with the advice of 
legal counsel to protect Company’s interests.
10.	 Credit Risk
	
As a matter of business practice, the payment collection 
process may extend over a period of time. Customers 
budgeting constraints can impact their ability to make the 
required payments. In addition, the creditworthiness of our 
clients may deteriorate and we can be adversely affected by 
bankruptcies or other business failures of our customers.
	
INITIATIVES: R Systems’ credit terms are standard and there is 
rigorous process in following up with customers for payments as 
and when the invoices fall due for payment. The Company has 
suitably streamlined its processes to develop a more focused 
and aggressive receivables management systems to ensure 
timely collections as a result of the global liquidity crunch.
11.	 Foreign Currency Rate Fluctuations
	
Managing an equilibrium state in the light of the unfavourable 
movements in exchange rates involved in earnings and 
expenditure in foreign currency continues to be one of the 
challenges when exposed to global markets. A significantly 
large percentage of R Systems consolidated revenues 
are either foreign currency denominated or derived from 
export earnings. Whereas a major portion of the R Systems 
expenses in India are incurred in Indian Rupees. As a result, 
operating profits will be highly impacted by foreign currency 
rate fluctuations. While depreciation of the Indian Rupee 
would have a favourable bottom-line impact, an appreciation 
would affect R Systems profitability adversely.
	
INITIATIVES: R Systems cannot directly influence exchange 
rates, it is incumbent upon management to follow a well 
thought out policy to hedge the risk associated with foreign 
currency without taking speculative positions. R Systems 
attempts to minimize currency fluctuation risks on export 
earnings by taking forward covers on Rupee - USD/EURO 
exchange rate based on anticipated revenues and debtors 
at periodic intervals. R Systems has laid down appropriate 
policies and processes for the use of financial derivative 
instruments consistent with its risk management strategy. 
The Company does not use the foreign exchange forward 
contracts for trading or speculation purposes.

12.	 Inflation and Cost Structure
	
R Systems’ cost structure consists of salary and other 
compensation expenses, overseas travel, and other 
general selling and administrative costs. Rapid economic 
development in India and increasing demand for global 
delivery may have a significant impact on these costs and 
the rate of inflation as relevant to the IT & ITES services 
industry. This is compounded by the fact that overseas 
competitors may treat their India strategy as a cost centre 
and develop the same regardless of the cost incurred and its 
impact on their profitability.
	
INITIATIVES: R Systems’ major costs are salary and benefit 
cost that it incurs on employees. These costs may have a 
tendency to escalate faster than the rate of inflation because 
of the demand for skilled and experienced professionals. 
R Systems attempts to mitigate the risks associated with 
wage inflation by obtaining increased price from clients, 
increasing bench mark prices for new business, enhancing 
productivity, increasing utilisation and inducting fresh 
graduates and training them. Further, R Systems has 
implemented robust processes and information systems 
to enable personnel to make the right decisions for revenue 
realisation and cost optimisation to minimise the risks of 
changes in salary cost structure.
13.	 Intellectual Property Rights
	
As a part of R Systems’ business, there are risks associated 
with intellectual property of the Company, intellectual 
property of R Systems’ customers who may be end users or 
even the intellectual property of the end user.
	
INITIATIVES: R Systems’ information security arrangements 
are managed under international standard ISO 27001 : 2013 
series and are being audited by both internal and experts 
from third parties assessors who periodically audit and 
certify R Systems compliance.
	
We have registered the following marks and their 
corresponding words as R Systems’ trademarks:
14.	 Information Security Management
	
R Systems being an IT and Software service provider company focusses on maintaining the confidentiality, integrity and availability 
of business data and information to the exclusive but optimum use for the accomplishment of organizational objective. The task 
of maintaining the confidentiality of business data and information not only faces threat from outside the organization but also 
within the organization where the business data and information are put to use.
	
INITIATIVES: For ensuring the effectiveness of Information security, it is important that information security can be effective only 
if it is addressed at people, process and technology levels and is integrated in the way an organization operates. R Systems has 
established, documented and implemented Information Security Management Systems (ISMS) and shall continually improve its 
effectiveness in accordance with requirements of ISO 27001:2013, SOC2 Type 2 and HIPAA. The approach applied to the ISMS is 
given in Figure below:
	
The Company has registered the word “R SYSTEMS” 
and logo 
 and 
 under relevant classes with the 
Registrar in India. The Company has also registered the

Risk Management Report
 	
R Systems security policy provides a framework for 
protecting confidentiality, integrity and ensuring availability 
of organization’s Information assets to the authorized 
persons. This is to safeguard the interest of customer, 
business continuity and continual improvement of ISMS 
at R Systems. The security policy of R Systems has been 
designed to safeguard the risk associated with information 
security management.	
15.	  Contractual Risk
	
The primary contractual risks that R Systems faces pertain 
to obligations of R Systems to provide services with full 
adherence to contracted terms of quality, time deadlines, 
output per hour, protection of confidential information, 
protection of intellectual property rights, patents and 
copyrights. R Systems has a rigorous process to evaluate 
the legal risks involved in a contract, ascertains its legal 
responsibilities under the applicable law of the contract and 
tries to restrict its liabilities to the maximum extent possible.
	
INITIATIVES: R Systems attempts to protect itself with 
“no consequential losses” and “maximum liability” clauses. 
R Systems also ensures that risks are protected through 
various insurances like professional liability, workers 
compensation, directors’ and officers’ liability, cyber & 
crime insurance. The Company’s past record in this regard 
has been good and there has been no significant damages 
awarded against the Company that has resulted in material 
adverse impact on our financial position. 
	
R Systems also has an escalation process to immediately 
involve senior management personnel in case R Systems 
customers 
or 
contractors 
make 
any 
assertion 
of 
breach of contract.
	
R Systems has employed professionals with adequate legal 
expertise who plays handy role in finalizing the various terms 
under written contracts on behalf of the Company. The 
experience gained from past contracts and transaction entered 
into by the Company are also analysed and implemented for 
the new contracts envisaged by the Company. As a matter 
of practice depending upon the criticality of the transactions, 
contractual agreements are well discussed within the 
organization in coordination with technical team as well legal 
professionals and are also negotiated with the advice of legal 
counsel to protect Company’s interests.
16.	 Execution Risk
	
R Systems clients are Tech and Independent Software 
Vendors and companies from Healthcare, Manufacturing 
and  Logistics, Telecom, Media, and Entertainment, Banking 
and Financial Services and Retail and Hospitality Sectors. 
These clients need high quality and timely delivery of services 
with very stringent services level agreements. Any failure in 
delivery, quality, meeting service level bench agreements, 
product features and functionalities could adversely affect 
R Systems relationship with its clients, which could 
potentially impact R Systems revenues and profitability.
	
INITIATIVES: R Systems has continuously invested in 
processes, people, training, information systems, quality 
standards, frameworks, tools and methodologies to mitigate 
the risks associated with execution of projects. Adoption 
of quality models and practices such as ISO and Capability 
Maturity Model (CMM) have ensured that risks are identified 
and mitigated at various levels in the planning and execution 
process. Further, senior management personnel, project 
managers and process leaders are entrusted with the 
responsibility to meet the project and service level expectations 
on various engagements. Planned intervention and escalation 
systems are further deployed to minimise risks.
17.	 Directors’ and Officers’ Liability Risks
	
The directors and officers of R Systems are required to 
take material decisions in the best interest of the Company. 
Such decisions might result in errors and omissions and 
R Systems might be sued by the other counterpart.
	
INITIATIVES: To mitigate this risk, the directors and officers 
take legal and expert advice when required and have 
taken various insurance policies outlined earlier including 
professional liability and directors’ and officers’ liability 
insurance. The Company attempts to limit its contractual 
liability for damages arising from negligent acts, errors, 
mistakes or omissions by directors and officers in rendering 
services, there can be no assurance that the limitations of 
liability set forth in its service contracts will be enforceable 
in all instances or will otherwise protect the Company from 
liability for damages. Though the Company maintains general 
liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors or 
omissions, going forward, there can be no assurance that 
such coverage will be available on reasonable terms and in 
sufficient amount to cover one or more large claims, or that 
the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim. 
The successful assertion of one or more large claims against 
the Company could adversely affect the Company’s results of 
operations and financial condition.
18.	 Visa Regulations / Restrictions 
	
Several overseas employees of R Systems are Indian 
nationals. The ability of R Systems to render its services in 
the US, Europe and other countries depends on the ability to 
obtain visas and work permits. Immigration to US, Europe 
and other countries are subject to legislative changes as well 
as variations in standards of application and enforcement 
due to political forces and economic conditions for example, 
any major change in immigration policy of USA may put the 
challenge to Indian IT Companies. It is difficult to predict the 
political and economic events that could affect immigrations 
laws or the restrictive impact they could have on obtaining 
or monitoring work visas. The reliance on visas makes 
R Systems vulnerable to such changes and variations as 
it affects the ability of the Company to staff projects with 
employees who are not citizens of the country where the 
work is to be performed. As a result,  R Systems may not 
R Systems International Limited 
Annual Report 2023
130
be able to get a sufficient number of visas for employees or 
may encounter delays or additional costs all of which may 
affect profitability.
	
INITIATIVES: R Systems monitors the status of visa 
availability and requirements on a regular basis in 
consultation with external legal counsel. In house legal 
personnel are entrusted with the responsibility for 
compliance with the immigrations laws which is validated 
by periodic independent audit. R Systems may expand its 
business in other geographies to de-risk from US business 
meanwhile it may boost US hiring. R Systems may look 
forward to change its business models so that it can deliver 
from different locations globally through innovation.
19.	 Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Risks
	
ESG Risks are those concerns arising from Environmental, 
Social and Governance factors that are likely to affect the 
financial situation or operating performance of a company. 
	
The environmental aspect focuses on how the business 
minimises its impact on the environment. The social aspect 
focuses on how a business impacts wider society and 
workplace culture. Governance refers to business's ethical 
behaviour and its transparency with stakeholders about 
its activities.
	
These factors have a significant impact on a Company's 
long-term 
sustainability, 
profitability 
and 
reputation 
of the Company.
	
INITIATIVES: The Company is cautious of the impact of 
its operation on the environment and society as well. The 
Company is diligently integrating good environmental, social 
and governance practices into its policies and operations. 
	
Though your Company does not have energy intensive 
operation, every possible endeavour has been made for 
optimal usage of energy and resources. 
	
The Company promotes a safe and healthy working 
environment, 
ensuring 
equal 
opportunities, 
respects 
human rights and fair treatment for all employees. The 
Company also expects all its employees, consultants, 
independent contractors and suppliers to observe these 
practices. As a responsible Corporate Citizen, the Company 
engages with the Community through its Corporate Social 
Responsibility initiatives.
	
The Company ensures a transparent and effective 
communication 
with 
its 
stakeholders, 
fostering 
a 
diverse 
and 
balanced 
board 
structure, 
inculcating 
anti-corruption policies, and establishing fair and reasonable 
executive compensation.
	
R Systems has a compliance management system with 
qualified managers entrusted with compliance of various 
laws including the listing laws and regulations applicable to 
public companies in India. The Company uses independent 
legal counsel to advise the Company on compliance issues 
with respect to the laws of various countries in which the 
Company has its business activities and to ensure that it is 
not in violation of the laws applicable.
	
Details of policies and action taken to address the ESG Risk 
are covered in Business, Responsibility and sustainability 
Report as forms Part of Directors’ Report.
20.	 Political Risk
	
The Government of India has been favourably disposed 
towards the IT and BPO industry in India. Further, we operate 
in multiple countries of which the US is a major market. 
While most governments in the countries where we operate 
are in favor of free trade, we cannot be immune to changes 
in policies that may discourage off-shoring to protect 
local employment.

Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone

there are no key audit matters to communicate in our report.
Information Other than the Financial Statements and 
Auditor’s Report Thereon
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the other

Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with 
Governance for the Standalone Financial Statements
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters 
stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation 
of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair 
view of the financial position, financial performance including 
other comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity of 
the Company in accordance with the Ind AS and other accounting

includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in 
accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the 
assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds 
and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate 
accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that 
are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and 
maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were 
operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness 
of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and 
presentation of the standalone financial statements that give 
a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the standalone financial statements, management is 
responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless 
management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease 
operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The Company’s	 Board of Directors are also responsible for 
overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the Standalone 
Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the standalone financial statements as a whole are free from

material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to 
issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that 
an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise 
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or 
in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
standalone financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:
 
 
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of 
the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud 
or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive 
to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The 
risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting 
from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as 
fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
 
 
Obtain an understanding of internal financial control relevant to 
the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate 
in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are 
also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the 
Company has adequate internal financial controls system in 
place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
 
 
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used 
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and 
related disclosures made by the management.
 
 
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of 
the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the 
audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty 
exists related to events or conditions that may cast 
significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty 
exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s 
report to the related disclosures in the standalone financial 
statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify 
our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence 
obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, 
future events or conditions may cause the Company to 
cease to continue as a going concern.
 
 
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the 
standalone financial statements, including the disclosures, 
and whether the standalone financial statements represent 
the underlying transactions and events in a manner that 
achieves fair presentation.
Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the standalone 
financial statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes 
it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably 
knowledgeable user of the standalone financial statements may 
be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative 
factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating 
the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any 
identified misstatements in the standalone financial statements.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, 
among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the 
audit and significant audit findings, including any significant 
deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement 
that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding 
independence, and to communicate with them all relationships 
and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

Report on the Internal Financial Controls with reference to the standalone financial statements

We have audited the internal financial controls with reference to

with our audit of the standalone financial statements of the

Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial 
Controls
The Company’s management is responsible for establishing 
and maintaining internal financial controls with reference to 
the standalone financial statements based on the internal 
control with reference to the standalone financial statements 
criteria established by the Company considering the essential 
components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on 
Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting 
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) 
(the “Guidance Note”). These responsibilities include the design, 
implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial 
controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly 
and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the 
company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention 
and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness 
of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable 
financial information, as required under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's 
internal financial controls with reference to the standalone financial 
statements of the Company based on our audit. We conducted 
our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note issued by the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and the Standards on 
Auditing prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent 
applicable to an audit of internal financial controls with reference 
to the standalone financial statements. Those Standards and the 
Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and 
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to the 
standalone financial statements was established and maintained 
and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls 
with reference to the standalone financial statements and their 
operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls 
with reference to the standalone financial statements included 
obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with 
reference to the standalone financial statements, assessing the 
risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating 
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based 
on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the 
auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of 
material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due 
to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the 
Company’s internal financial controls with reference to the 
standalone financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference 
to standalone financial statements
A company's internal financial control with reference to standalone 
financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable 
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and 
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A 
company's internal financial control with reference to standalone 
financial statements includes those policies and procedures that 
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, 
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of 
the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that 
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation 
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures 
of the company are being made only in accordance with 
authorisations of management and directors of the company; 
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or 
timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition 
of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the 
financial statements.

with reference to standalone financial statements

Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls 
with reference to standalone financial statements to future periods 
are subject to the risk that the internal financial control with reference

Nature of operations
	
R 
Systems 
International 
Limited 
(the 
‘Company’ 
or 
‘R 
Systems’) 
(Corporate 
Identification 
Number: 
L74899DL1993PLC053579) is a public company domiciled

i.e. Independent Software Vendor (ISV), Healthcare,

2.	
Significant Accounting Policies
	
(a)	 Statement of compliance
	
	
These standalone financial statements (the 'financial 
statements') are prepared in accordance with the 
Indian Accounting Standards (‘Ind AS’) prescribed 
under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 
(‘the Act’) read with Companies (Indian Accounting 
Standard) Rules as amended from time to time.
	
	
Accounting policies have been consistently applied except 
where a newly issued accounting standard is initially 
adopted or a revision to an existing accounting standard 
requires a change in the accounting policy hitherto in use.
	
(b)	 Functional and presentation currency 
	
	
These financial statements are presented in Indian 
Rupee (INR), which is also the Company’s functional 
currency. All amounts have been presented in million 
and rounded off upto two decimal places, unless 
otherwise indicated. 
	
(c)	 Basis of preparation and presentation
	
	
The financial statements of the Company have been 
prepared under the historical cost convention on an 
accrual basis except for certain financial instruments, 
net defined benefit obligations and other long-term 
employee benefits which have been measured at 
fair value. Historical cost is generally based on the 
fair value of consideration given in exchange of 
goods and services.
	
	
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell 
an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly 
transaction between market participants at the 
measurement date, regardless of whether that price 
is directly observable or estimated using another 
valuation technique. In estimating the fair value of an 
asset or a liability, the Company takes into account 
the characteristics of the asset or liability if market 
participants would take those characteristics into 
account when pricing the asset or liability at the 
measurement date. 
	
	
In addition, for financial reporting purposes, fair value 
measurements are categorised into Level 1, 2, or 3 
based on the degree to which the inputs to the fair value 
measurements are observable and the significance of 
the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety, 
which are described as follows:
	
	
Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active 
markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity 
can access at the measurement date;
	
	
Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices 
included within Level 1, that are observable for the 
asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and
	
	
Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the 
asset or liability.
	
	
Based on the nature of services rendered to customers 
and the time elapsed between deployment of resources 
and the realisation in cash and cash equivalents of the 
consideration of the services rendered, the Company 
has determined its operating cycle as 12 months for 
the purpose of classification of its assets and liabilities 
as current and non-current.
	
(d)	 Property, plant and equipment
	
	
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, 
less accumulated depreciation and accumulated 
impairment losses, if any. The cost comprises the 
purchase price and directly attributable costs of 
bringing the asset to its working condition for its 
intended use. Any trade discounts and rebates are 
deducted in arriving at the purchase price. 
	
	
When part of an item of property, plant and equipment 
has different useful lives, they are accounted for as 
separate items (major component) of property, plant 
and equipment. Subsequent expenditure related to an 
item of property, plant and equipment is added to its 
book value only if it is probable that future economic 
benefits associated with the item will flow to the 
Company. All other expenses on existing property, 
plant and equipment, including day-to-day repair and 
maintenance expenditure and cost of replacing parts, 
are charged to the statement of profit and loss for the 
year during which such expenses are incurred.
	
	
An item of property, plant and equipment is 
derecognised upon disposal or when no future 
economic benefits are expected to arise from the 
Notes
to Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 
149
CORPORATE OVERVIEW
STATUTORY REPORTS
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTICE
continued use of the asset. Gains or losses arising 
from disposal or retirement of property, plant and 
equipment are measured as the difference between 
the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of 
the asset and are recognised in the statement of profit 
and loss when the asset is disposed.
	
	
Amounts paid towards the acquisition of property, 
plant and equipment not received till the reporting date 
and the cost of property, plant and equipment received 
but not ready for intended use before such date are 
disclosed under capital advances and capital work-in-
progress (CWIP), respectively.
	
(e)	 Depreciation 
	
	
Depreciation is calculated on cost of items of property, 
plant and equipment and Investment Property, less their 
estimated residual values using the straight line method 
over the useful lives of the assets estimated by the 
management. The assets residual values and useful lives 
are reviewed at each financial year end or whenever there 
are indicators for review, and adjusted prospectively.
	
	
The management believes that depreciation rates 
currently used fairly reflect its estimate of the useful 
lives and residual values are in align with Part C of 
Schedule II of the Companies Act 2013. 
	
	
The management estimates the useful lives are 
as follows:
Category
Useful life up to
Buildings
30 years
Leasehold land
Lease period
Leasehold improvements
Lower of lease 
period or useful life
Plant and equipment - other 
than air conditioners
15 years
Air conditioners
5 years
Office Equipment (other than 
end user devices)
5 years
Computer hardware and 
network installations (other 
than end user devices)
6 years
End-user devices such as 
desktop, laptop, mobile 
phones etc.
3 years
Furniture and fittings
10 years
Vehicles
8 years
Electrical installation
10 years
	
(f)	
Intangible assets
	
	
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on 
initial recognition at cost. Following initial recognition, 
intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. 
	
	
Amortisation is recognised on a straight-line basis 
over their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful 
life is reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with 
the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted 
for on a prospective basis.
	
	
The management estimates the useful life as follows:
Category
Useful life up to
Computer software
Lower of license 
period or 3 years
	
(g)	 Investment property 
	
	
Investment properties are properties held to earn rentals 
and/or for capital appreciation (including property 
under construction for such purposes). Investment 
properties are measured initially at cost, including 
transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, 
investment properties are measured in accordance with 
requirements of Ind AS 16 for cost model.
	
	
An investment property is derecognised upon disposal 
or when the investment property is permanently 
withdrawn from use and no future economic benefits 
are expected from the disposal. Any gain or loss arising 
on de-recognition of the property, calculated as the 
difference between the net disposal proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset, is included in profit or loss 
in the period in which the property is derecognised.
	
(h)	 Government grants
	
	
Grants and subsidies from the government are 
recognised when there is reasonable assurance that 
the grant / subsidy will be received and all attaching 
conditions will be complied with.
	
	
When the grant or subsidy relates to an expense item, 
it is deducted in reporting the related expenses over 
the periods necessary to match them on a systematic 
basis to the costs, which it is intended to compensate. 
Grant or subsidy relating to expenses already incurred 
in previous years is recognised under other income.
	
(i)	
Financial instruments
	
	
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised 
when the Company becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instruments. 
	
	
Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured 
at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable 
to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial 
liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities 
at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted 
from the fair value of the financial assets or financial 
liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction 
costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial 
Notes
to Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 
R Systems International Limited 
Annual Report 2023
150
assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or 
loss are recognised immediately in profit or loss.
	
	
Offsetting of financial instruments
	
	
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the 
net amounts are presented in the standalone balance 
sheet when, and only when, the Company currently has 
a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it 
intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realize 
the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
	
(j)	
Financial assets
	
	
All regular way purchases or sales of financial assets 
are recognised and derecognised on a trade date 
basis. Regular way purchases or sales are purchases 
or sales of financial assets that require delivery of 
assets within the time frame established by regulation 
or convention in the marketplace.
	
	
All recognised financial assets are subsequently measured 
in their entirety at either amortised cost or fair value, 
depending on the classification of the financial assets.
	
	
Classification of financial assets
	
	
(i)	
Debt instruments that meet the following 
conditions are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost (except for debt instruments that 
are designated as at fair value through profit or 
loss on initial recognition):
	
	
	
-	
the asset is held within a business model 
whose objective is to hold assets in order to 
collect contractual cash flows; and
	
	
	
-	
the contractual terms of the instrument give 
rise on specified dates to cash flows that 
are solely payments of principal and interest 
on the principal amount outstanding.
	
	
(ii)	
Debt instruments that meet the following 
conditions are subsequently measured at fair 
value through other comprehensive income 
(FVTOCI) (except for debt instruments that are 
designated as at fair value through profit or loss 
on initial recognition):
	
	
	
-	
the asset is held within a business model 
whose objective is achieved both by 
collecting contractual cash flows and 
selling financial assets; and
	
	
	
-	
the contractual terms of the instrument give 
rise on specified dates to cash flows that 
are solely payments of principal and interest 
on the principal amount outstanding.
	
	
Interest income is recognised in profit or loss for FVTOCI 
debt instruments. For the purposes of recognising 
foreign exchange gains and losses, FVTOCI debt 
instruments are treated as financial assets measured 
at amortised cost. Thus, the exchange differences on 
the amortised cost are recognised in profit or loss and 
other changes in the fair value of FVTOCI financial 
assets are recognised in other comprehensive income 
and accumulated under the heading of ‘Reserve 
for debt instruments through other comprehensive 
income’. When the investment is disposed of, the 
cumulative gain or loss previously accumulated in this 
reserve is reclassified to profit or loss.
	
	
All other financial assets are subsequently measured 
at fair value.
	
	
Effective interest method
	
	
The effective interest method is a method of calculating 
the amortised cost of a debt instrument and of 
allocating interest income over the relevant period. The 
effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts 
estimated future cash receipts (including all fees and 
points paid or received that form an integral part of 
the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other 
premiums or discounts) through the expected life of 
the debt instrument or where appropriate, a shorter 
period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.
	
	
Income is recognised on an effective interest basis for 
debt instruments other than those financial assets 
classified as at FVTPL. Interest income is recognised in 
profit or loss and is included in the “Other income” line item.
	
	
(iii)	 Investments in equity instruments at FVTOCI
	
	
	
On initial recognition, the Company can make an 
irrevocable election (on an instrument-by-instrument 
basis) to present the subsequent changes in fair 
value in other comprehensive income pertaining 
to investments in equity instruments. This election 
is not permitted if the equity investment is held 
for trading. These elected investments are initially 
measured at fair value plus transaction costs. 
Subsequently, they are measured at fair value with 
gains and losses arising from changes in fair value 
recognised in other comprehensive income and 
accumulated in the ‘Reserve for equity instruments 
through 
other 
comprehensive 
income’. 
The 
cumulative gain or loss is not reclassified to profit or 
loss on disposal of the investments.
	
	
	
A financial asset is held for trading if:
	
	
	
-	
it has been acquired principally for the 
purpose of selling it in the near term; or

-	
on initial recognition it is part of a portfolio 
of identified financial instruments that the 
Company manages together and has a recent 
actual pattern of short-term profit-taking; or
	
	
	
-	
it is a derivative that is not designated and 
effective as a hedging instrument or a 
financial guarantee.
	
	
(iv)	 Financial assets at fair value through profit 
or loss (FVTPL)
	
	
	
Investments in equity instruments, other than 
investment in subsidiary, are classified as at FVTPL, 
unless the Company irrevocably elects on initial 
recognition to present subsequent changes in fair 
value in other comprehensive income for investments 
in equity instruments which are not held for trading.
	
	
	
Debt instruments that do not meet the amortised 
cost criteria or FVTOCI criteria (see above) are 
measured at FVTPL. In addition, debt instruments 
that meet the amortised cost criteria or the 
FVTOCI criteria but are designated as at FVTPL 
are measured at FVTPL.
	
	
	
A financial asset that meets the amortised cost 
criteria or debt instruments that meet the FVTOCI 
criteria may be designated as at FVTPL upon 
initial recognition if such designation eliminates 
or significantly reduces a measurement or 
recognition inconsistency that would arise from 
measuring assets or liabilities or recognising the 
gains and losses on them on different bases. 
	
	
	
Financial assets at FVTPL are measured at fair 
value at the end of each reporting period, with 
any gains or losses arising on re-measurement 
recognised in profit or loss. The net gain or loss 
recognised in profit or loss incorporates any 
dividend or interest earned on the financial asset 
and is included in the ‘Other income’ line item. 
Dividend on financial assets at FVTPL is recognised 
when the Company’s right to receive the dividends 
is established, it is probable that the economic 
benefits associated with the dividend will flow to 
the Company, the dividend does not represent a 
recovery of part of cost of the investment and the 
amount of dividend can be measured reliably.
	
	
(v)	
Investment in subsidiary companies
	
	
	
Investment 
in 
subsidiary 
companies 
is 
measured at cost.
	
	
De-recognition of financial assets
	
	
The Company derecognises a financial asset when the 
contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, 
or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially 
all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to 
another party. If the Company neither transfers nor retains 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership 
and continues to control the transferred asset, the 
Company recognises its retained interest in the asset 
and an associated liability for amounts it may have to 
pay. If the Company retains substantially all the risks and 
rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, 
the Company continues to recognise the financial asset 
and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the 
proceeds received.
	
	
On de-recognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the 
difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the 
sum of the consideration received and receivable and 
the cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised 
in other comprehensive income and accumulated in 
equity is recognised in profit or loss if such gain or loss 
would have otherwise been recognised in profit or loss 
on disposal of that financial asset.
	
	
Foreign exchange gains and losses
	
	
The fair value of financial assets denominated in a 
foreign currency is determined in that foreign currency 
and translated at the spot rate at the end of each 
reporting period.
	
	
(i)	
For foreign currency denominated financial 
assets measured at amortised cost and FVTPL, 
the exchange differences are recognised in profit 
or loss except for those which are designated as 
hedging instruments in a hedging relationship.
	
	
(ii)	
Changes in the carrying amount of investments 
in equity instruments at FVTOCI relating to 
changes in foreign currency rates are recognised 
in other comprehensive income.
	
	
(iii)	 For the purposes of recognising foreign exchange 
gains and losses, FVTOCI debt instruments 
are treated as financial assets measured at 
amortised cost. Thus, the exchange differences 
on the amortised cost are recognised in profit 
or loss and other changes in the fair value of 
FVTOCI financial assets are recognised in other 
comprehensive income.
	
(k)	 Financial liabilities 
	
	
For the purpose of subsequent measurement, financial 
liabilities are classified as:
	
	
-	
Financial liabilities at amortised cost
	
	
	
Financial liabilities are subsequently measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest 
rate method. The change in measurements is 
Notes

R Systems International Limited

152
recognised as finance costs in the statement of 
profit and loss.
	
	
-	
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit 
or loss (FVTPL)
	
	
	
Financial liabilities at FVTPL represented by 
contingent consideration are measured at fair 
value with all change recognised in the statement 
of profit and loss.
	
	
De-recognition of financial liabilities
	
	
The 
Company 
derecognises 
financial 
liabilities 
when, and only when, the Company’s obligations are 
discharged, cancelled or have expired. 
	
(l)	
Impairment
	
	
i.	
Financial assets
	
	
	
The Company applies Expected Credit Loss 
(ECL) model for measurement and recognition 
of impairment loss on financial assets measured 
at amortised cost and financial assets that are 
debts instruments and are measured at fair value 
through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI). 
ECL is the difference between contractual cash 
flows that are due and the cash flows that the 
Company expects to receive, discounted at the 
original effective interest rate.
	
	
	
For trade receivables, the Company recognises 
impairment loss allowance based on lifetime 
ECL at each reporting date, right from its initial 
recognition. For other financial assets, the 
Company determines whether there has been 
a significant increase in the credit risk since 
initial recognition. If credit risk has not increased 
significantly, 12 month ECL is used to provide 
for impairment loss. However, if credit risk has 
increased significantly, lifetime ECL is used.
	
	
ii.	
Impairment of investment in subsidiaries:
	
	
	
The 
Company 
assesses 
investments 
in 
subsidiaries for impairment whenever events 
or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying amount of the investment may not be 
recoverable. If any such indication exists, the 
Company estimates the recoverable amount of 
the investment in subsidiary. The recoverable 
amount of such investment is the higher of its 
fair value less cost of disposal and its value-
in-use (VIU). The VIU of the investment is 
calculated using projected future cash flows. If 
the recoverable amount of the investment is less 
than its carrying amount, the carrying amount is 
reduced to its recoverable amount. The reduction 
is treated as an impairment loss and is recognised 
in the statement of profit and loss.
	
	
iii.	
Non-financial assets
	
	
	
The Company’s non-financial assets, excluding 
deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each balance 
sheet date or whenever there is any indication of 
impairment based on internal/external factors. If 
any indications exist, the Company estimates the 
asset’s recoverable amount.
	
	
	
An impairment loss is recognised wherever 
the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its 
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is 
the greater of the asset’s fair value and its value 
in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash flows are discounted to their present 
value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of 
money and risks specific to the asset. 
	
(m)	 Derivative financial instruments
	
	
The Company enters into foreign exchange forward 
contracts to manage its exposure to foreign 
exchange rate risks. 
	
	
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the 
date the derivative contracts are entered into and are 
subsequently re-measured to their fair value at the end 
of each reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is 
recognised in profit or loss immediately unless the 
derivative is designated and effective as a hedging 
instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition 
in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedging 
relationship and the nature of the hedged item.
	
	
Hedge accounting
	
	
The Company designates certain hedging instruments, 
which include derivatives, embedded derivatives and 
non-derivatives in respect of foreign currency risk, as 
either fair value hedges or cash flow hedges. Hedges 
of foreign exchange risk on firm commitments are 
accounted for as cash flow hedges.
	
	
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the entity 
documents the relationship between the hedging 
instrument and the hedged item, along with its 
risk management objectives and its strategy for 
undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, 
at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing 
basis, the Company documents whether the hedging 
instrument is highly effective in offsetting changes in 
fair values or cash flows of the hedged item attributable 
to the hedged risk.

Fair value hedges
	
	
Changes in fair value of the designated portion of 
derivatives that qualify as fair value hedges are 
recognised in profit or loss immediately, together with 
any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or 
liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. The 
change in the fair value of the designated portion of 
hedging instrument and the change in the hedged item 
attributable to the hedged risk are recognised in profit 
or loss in the line item relating to the hedged item.
	
	
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging 
instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, 
or when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. 
The fair value adjustment to the carrying amount of the 
hedged item arising from the hedged risk is amortised 
to profit or loss from that date.
	
	
Cash flow hedges
	
	
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of 
derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash 
flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive 
income and accumulated under the heading of cash 
flow hedging reserve. The gain or loss relating to 
the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in 
profit or loss.
	
	
Amounts 
previously 
recognised 
in 
other 
comprehensive income and accumulated in equity 
relating to (effective portion as described above) are 
reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the 
hedged item affects profit or loss, in the same line 
as the recognised hedged item. However, when the 
hedged forecast transaction results in the recognition 
of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, such 
gains and losses are transferred from equity (but not 
as a reclassification adjustment) and included in the 
initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial 
asset or non-financial liability.
	
	
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging 
instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or 
when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any gain 
or loss recognised in other comprehensive income and 
accumulated in equity at that time remains in equity and 
is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately 
recognised in profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is 
no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated 
in equity is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
	
(n)	 Borrowing costs
	
	
Borrowing costs are interest and other costs incurred in 
connection with the borrowing of funds and interest on 
lease liabilities. Borrowing costs directly attributable to the 
acquisition, construction or development of an asset that 
necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready 
for its intended use are capitalised as part of the cost of 
that asset. All other borrowing costs are recognised as an 
expense in the period in which they are incurred.
	
(o)	 Leases
	
	
Where the Company is a lessee
	
	
The Company’s lease asset classes primarily consist 
of leases for land, buildings and furniture. The 
Company, at the inception of a contract, assesses 
whether the contract is a lease or not lease. A contract 
is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right 
to control the use of an identified asset for a time in 
exchange for a consideration. To assess whether 
a contract conveys the right to control the use of an 
identified asset, the Company assesses whether: (i) 
the contract involves the use of an identified asset (ii) 
the Company has substantially all of the economic 
benefits from use of the asset through the period of 
the lease and (iii) the Company has the right to direct 
the use of the asset.
	
	
The Company recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease 
liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-
use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises 
the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any 
lease payments made at or before the commencement 
date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate 
of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or 
to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is 
located, less any lease incentives received. 
	
	
The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated 
from the commencement date on a straight-line basis 
over the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the 
underlying asset. The estimated useful lives of right-
of-use assets are determined on the same basis as 
those of property, plant and equipment.
	
	
The lease liability is initially measured at the present 
value of the future lease payments. The lease payments 
are discounted using the rate implicit in the lease or, if not 
readily determinable, using the incremental borrowing 
rate. It is remeasured when there is a change in future 
lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate 
or if the Company changes its assessment of whether 
it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination 
option. When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, 
a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying 
amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in profit 
or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset 
has been reduced to zero. 
	
	
The Company has opted for the practical expedient 
under Ind AS 116 Para 46A read with Para 46B which 
provides lessee an option not to assess COVID-19-
related rent concession as a lease modification. Basis 
Notes
to Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 
R Systems International Limited 
Annual Report 2023
154
the practical expedient the Company has recorded lease 
rent concession under other income. The expedient 
initially allowed for COVID-19-related rent concessions 
to payments originally due on or before June 30, 
2021 has been extended to June 30, 2022. Any lease 
concession received subsequent to June 30, 2022 
has been accounted for as a lease modification and 
a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying 
amount of the related right-of-use asset and lease liability.
	
	
The Company has elected not to recognise right-of-
use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases 
that have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases 
of low-value assets. The Company recognises the 
lease payments associated with these leases as an 
expense over the lease term. 
	
	
Lease liability and ROU asset have been separately 
presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments 
have been classified as financing activity under cash 
flows statements.
	
	
Where the Company is a lessor
	
	
Leases in which the Company does not transfer 
substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership 
of the asset are classified as operating leases. Assets 
comprising land and building which are subject to 
operating leases are included under non-current 
assets as investment property and are carried at cost 
less accumulated depreciation. Lease income on an 
operating lease is recognised in the statement of profit 
and loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
Costs, including depreciation, are recognised as an 
expense in the statement of profit and loss.
	
(p)	 Revenue 
	
	
The Company derives revenue primarily from 
software development and related services and 
business process outsourcing services. The Company 
recognises revenue when the performance obligations 
as promised have been satisfies with a transaction 
price and when where there is no uncertainty as to 
measurement or collectability of the consideration. 
	
	
The Company has applied the guidance in Ind AS 
115, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”, by 
applying the revenue recognition criteria for each 
distinct performance obligation. The arrangements with 
customers generally meet the criteria for considering 
these services as distinct performance obligations. 
For allocating the transaction price, the Company has 
measured the revenue in respect of each performance 
obligation of a contract at its relative standalone selling 
price. The Company accounts for volume discounts 
and pricing incentives to customers as a reduction of 
revenue based on the ratable allocation of the discounts 
/ incentives to each of the underlying performance 
obligation that corresponds to the progress by the 
customer towards earning the discount/ incentive.
	
	
Contract modifications are accounted for when 
additions, deletions or changes are approved either to 
the contract scope or contract price. The accounting for 
modifications of contracts involves assessing whether 
the services added to an existing contract are distinct 
and whether the pricing is at the standalone selling price. 
Services added that are not distinct are accounted for 
on a cumulative catch up basis, while those that are 
distinct are accounted for prospectively, either as a 
separate contract, if the additional services are priced at 
the standalone selling price, or as a termination of the 
existing contract and creation of a new contract if not 
priced at the standalone selling price.
	
	
The Company collects Goods and Service Tax on 
behalf of the government and, therefore, these are not 
economic benefits flowing to the Company. Hence, 
they are excluded from revenue.
	
	
Arrangements with customers for services are either on a 
fixed-price, fixed-timeframe or on a time-and-material basis.
	
	
Revenue 
on 
time-and-material 
contracts 
are 
recognised as the related services are performed 
and revenue from the end of the last invoicing to the 
reporting date is recognised as unbilled revenue.
	
	
Revenue from fixed-price and fixed-timeframe contracts, 
where the performance obligations are satisfied over time 
and where there is no uncertainty as to measurement 
or collectability of consideration, is recognised as per 
the percentage-of-completion method. When there is 
uncertainty as to measurement or ultimate collectability, 
revenue recognition is postponed until such uncertainty 
is resolved. Efforts or costs expended have been used to 
measure progress towards completion as there is a direct 
relationship between input and productivity. Maintenance 
revenue is recognised ratably over the term of the 
underlying maintenance arrangement.
	
	
Revenue from licenses where the customer obtains a 
right to use are recognised at the time the licenses is 
made available to the customers.
	
	
Revenues in excess of invoicing are classified as 
contract assets (referred as unbilled revenue) while 
invoicing in excess of revenues are classified as 
contract liabilities (referred as unearned revenues).
	
	
Unbilled revenue for fixed price contracts are 
classified as non-financial asset if the contractual 
right to consideration is dependent on completion of 
contractual milestones. Unbilled revenue on contracts 
other than above is classified as a financial asset.

(q)	 Other income
	
	
Other income is comprised primarily of interest 
income, dividend income, net gain on foreign exchange 
fluctuations, rental income and gain on investments. 
Interest income is recognised on a time proportion basis 
taking into account the carrying amount and the effective 
interest rate. Dividend income is recognised when the 
Company’s right to receive dividend is established.
	
(r)	
Foreign currency transactions and balances 
	
	
Foreign currency transactions are recorded in the 
functional currency of the Company, by applying to the 
foreign currency amount the exchange rate between 
the functional currency and the foreign currency at the 
date of the transaction.
	
	
Conversion
	
	
Foreign currency monetary items are reported using 
the exchange rate prevailing at the reporting date. 
Non- monetary items, which are measured in terms of 
historical cost denominated in a foreign currency are 
reported using the exchange rate at the date of the 
transaction. Non-monetary items which are carried at 
fair value or other similar valuation denominated in a 
foreign currency are reported using the exchange rates 
at the date when the values were determined.
	
	
Exchange differences
	
	
Exchange differences arising on conversion / 
settlement of foreign currency monetary items 
and exchange gain / loss on forward contracts are 
recognised as income or expenses in the statement of 
profit and loss in the period in which they arise.
	
(s)	 Employee benefits
	
	
The Company participates in various employee benefit 
plans. Post-employment benefits are classified as either 
defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans. 
Under a defined contribution plan, the Company’s only 
obligation is to pay a fixed amount with no obligation 
to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold 
sufficient assets to pay all related employee benefits. 
The related risks fall on the employee. The expenditure 
for defined contribution plans is recognised as expense 
during the period when the employee provides service. 
Under a defined benefit plan, it is the Company’s 
obligation to provide agreed benefits to the employees. 
The related actuarial risks fall on the Company. The 
present value of the defined benefit obligations is 
calculated using the projected unit credit method.
	
	
(i)	
The Company’s contribution to social security 
plans such as provident fund, employee state 
insurance scheme, 401K etc. are considered as 
defined contribution plans and are charged as 
an expense based on the amount of contribution 
required to be made and when services are 
rendered by the employees.
	
	
(ii)	
Gratuity is a defined benefit obligation plan operated 
by the Company for its employees covered under 
Company Gratuity Scheme. The cost of providing 
benefit under gratuity plan is determined on the 
basis of actuarial valuation using the projected 
unit credit method at the reporting date and are 
charged to the statement of profit and loss except 
for the re-measurements comprising of actuarial 
gains and losses which are recognised in full in 
the statement of other comprehensive income 
in the reporting period in which they occur. Re-
measurements are not reclassified to statement 
of profit and loss subsequently. 
	
	
	
The provision for gratuity recognised in the 
balance sheet represents the present value of 
the defined benefit obligations reduced by the 
fair value of scheme assets. 
	
	
(iii)	 Compensated absences
	
	
	
The employees of the Company are entitled 
to compensated absences. The employees 
can carry forward a portion of the unutilised 
accumulating compensated absences and utilise 
it in future periods or receive cash at retirement 
or termination of employment. The Company 
records an obligation for compensated absences 
in the period in which the employee renders 
the services that increases this entitlement. 
The Company measures the expected cost of 
compensated absences as the additional amount 
that the Company expects to pay as a result of 
the unused entitlement that has accumulated 
at the end of the reporting period. The Company 
recognises accumulated compensated absences 
based on actuarial valuation. The actuarial gains 
and losses are recognised in the statement of 
profit and loss. Non-accumulating compensated 
absences are recognised in the period in which 
the absences occur.
	
	
	
The Company presents the entire Compensated 
absences liability as a current liability in the 
balance sheet, since it does not have an 
unconditional right to defer its settlement for 
twelve months after the reporting date.
	
(t)	
Income taxes
	
	
Tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. It is 
recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it 
relates to a business combination or to an item recognised 
directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.

Current tax
	
	
Current income tax is measured at the amount 
expected to be paid to the tax authorities in accordance 
with the Income Tax Act, 1961 enacted in India and tax 
laws prevailing in the respective tax jurisdictions where 
the Company operates. The tax rates and tax laws used 
to compute the amount are those that are enacted or 
substantively enacted, at the reporting date. 
	
	
Current tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset 
only if there is a legally enforceable right to set off the 
recognised amounts, and it is intended to realise the asset 
and settle the liability on a net basis or simultaneously.
	
	
Deferred tax
	
	
Deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary 
differences between tax base of assets and liabilities 
and their carrying amounts. Deferred tax is measured 
based on the tax rates and the tax laws enacted or 
substantively enacted at the reporting date.
	
	
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences, except deferred tax liability arising 
from initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability 
in a transaction that is not a business combination and, 
affects neither accounting nor taxable profit/ loss at the 
time of transaction. Deferred tax assets are recognised 
for all deductible temporary differences, the carry forward 
of unused tax credits and any unused tax losses, except 
deferred tax assets arising from initial recognition of 
goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not 
a business combination and, affects neither accounting 
nor taxable profit/ loss at the time of transaction. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that 
sufficient future taxable income will be available against 
which such deferred tax assets can be realised.
	
	
In the situations where the Company is entitled to a tax 
holiday under the Income-tax Act, 1961 enacted in India 
or tax laws prevailing in the respective tax jurisdictions 
where it operates, no deferred tax (asset or liability) is 
recognised in respect of temporary differences which 
reverse during the tax holiday period, to the extent the 
Company’s gross total income is subject to the deduction 
during the tax holiday period. Deferred tax in respect of 
temporary differences which reverse after the tax holiday 
period is recognised in the year in which the temporary 
differences originate.
	
	
The carrying amount of deferred tax asset is reviewed at 
each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available 
against which such deferred tax assets can be realised.
	
	
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset, 
if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax 
assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred 
tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to the same 
taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
	
	
Minimum alternate tax (MAT) paid in a year is charged 
to the statement of profit and loss as current tax. 
MAT credit available is recognised as an asset only to 
the extent that there is convincing evidence that the 
Company will pay normal income tax during the period, 
i.e., the period for which MAT credit is allowed to be 
carried forward. MAT credit asset is created by way of 
credit to the statement of profit and loss and shown as 
“MAT Credit Entitlement” under deferred tax assets. 
	
(u)	 Segment reporting
	
	
The Company determines reportable segment based 
on information reported to the Chief Operating 
Decision Maker (CODM) for the purposes of resource 
allocation and assessment of segmental performance. 
The CODM evaluates the Company's performance and 
allocates resources based on an analysis of various 
performance indicators by business segments. The 
accounting principles used in the preparation of the 
financial statements are consistently applied to record 
revenue and expenditure in individual segments.
	
	
Each segment item reported is measured at the 
measure used to report to the CODM for the purposes 
of making decisions about allocating resources to the 
segment and assessing its performance.
	
	
Inter segment transfers:
	
	
The Company generally accounts for inter segment 
sales and transfers as if the sales or transfers were to 
third parties at current market prices.
	
	
Allocation of common costs:
	
	
Common allocable costs are allocated to each 
segment according to the relative contribution of each 
segment to the total common costs.
	
	
Unallocated items:
	
	
The corporate and other segment includes general 
corporate income and expense items which are not 
allocated to any business segment.
	
(v)	 Earnings per share (EPS)
	
	
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing 
the net profit for the year attributable to equity 
shareholders by the weighted average number of 
equity shares outstanding during the year. 
	
	
The weighted average number of equity shares 
outstanding during the reporting period is adjusted for 
events such as bonus issue, bonus element in a rights 
issue, share split, and reverse share split (consolidation 
of shares), if any occurred during the reporting

NOTICE
period, that have changed the number of equity 
shares outstanding, without a corresponding change 
in resources. The number of shares and potential 
dilutive equity shares are adjusted retrospectively for 
all periods presented for any bonus shares issues 
including for changes effected prior to the approval of 
the financial statements by the Board of Directors.
	
	
For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per 
share, the net profit for the year attributable to the equity 
shareholders and the weighted average number of 
equity shares outstanding during the year, are adjusted 
for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares.
	
(w)	 Share based payments
	
	
In accordance with Ind AS 102 – “Share Based Payments”, 
the cost of equity-settled transaction is determined by 
the fair value of the options at the date of the grant and 
recognised as employee compensation cost over the 
vesting period. The cumulative expense recognised for 
equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the 
vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period 
has expired and the Group’s best estimate of the number 
of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
	
	
The expense recognised in the statement of profit and 
loss for a year represents the movement in cumulative 
expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that 
year and is recognised in employee benefits expense. 
In case of the employee stock option schemes having 
a graded vesting schedule, each vesting tranche 
having different vesting period has been considered as 
a separate option grant and accounted for accordingly.
	
	
Where the terms of an equity-settled transaction 
award are modified, the minimum expense recognised 
is the expense as if the terms had not been modified, if 
the original terms of the award are met. An additional 
expense is recognised for any modification that 
increases the total fair value of the share-based 
payment transaction, or is otherwise beneficial to the 
employee as measured at the date of modification.
	
(x)	 Provisions
	
	
A provision is recognised when the Company has a present 
obligation as a result of past event; it is probable that an 
outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will 
be required to settle the obligation, in respect of which a 
reliable estimate can be made. Provisions are determined 
based on the best estimate required to settle the obligation 
at the reporting date. If the effect of time value of money 
is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-
tax rate that reflects the risks specific to the liability. These 
estimates are reviewed at each balance sheet date and 
adjusted to reflect the current best estimates.
	
(y)	 Contingent liabilities
	
	
A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises 
from past events whose existence will be confirmed 
by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more 
uncertain future events beyond the control of the 
Company or a present obligation that is not recognised 
because it is not probable that an outflow of resources 
will be required to settle the obligation. A contingent 
liability also arises in extremely rare cases where 
there is a liability that cannot be recognised because it 
cannot be measured reliably.
	
(z)	 Business combinations
	
	
Business combinations arising from transfers of 
interest in entities that are under the control of 
the shareholder that controls the Company are 
accounted for using pooling of interest method as if 
the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of the 
earliest comparative period presented. The assets 
and liabilities acquired are recognised at their carrying 
amounts. The identity of the reserves is preserved 
and they appear in the financial statements of the 
Company in the same form in which they appeared in 
the financial statements of the transferor company. 
The difference, if any, between the share capital issued 
plus any additional consideration in the form of cash 
or other assets and the amount of share capital of 
the transferor shall be recorded as capital reserve 
and presented separately as capital reserve under 
common control.
	
(aa)	 Cash and cash equivalents
	
	
Cash and cash equivalents in the cash flow statement 
comprises of cash at bank, cash in hand and short 
term deposits with an original maturity period of three 
months or less.
	
(ab)	 Use of estimates and judgement
	
	
The preparation of the financial statements in 
conformity with Ind AS requires the management to 
make judgments, estimates and assumptions that 
affect the reported amounts of revenue, expenses, 
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent 
liabilities at the end of year. These estimates are 
based on the management’s best knowledge of 
current events, historical experience, actions that the 
Company may undertake in the future and on various 
other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable 
under the circumstances. Actual results could differ 
from those estimates. 
	
	
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed 
on a periodic basis. Revisions to accounting estimates 
are recognised in the period in which the estimates are 
revised and in any future periods affected.

Annual Report 2023

Critical accounting estimates
	
	
i.	
Revenue recognition
	
	
	
The Company uses the percentage-of-completion 
method in accounting for its fixed-price contracts. 
Use of the percentage-of-completion method 
requires the Company to estimate the efforts or 
costs expended to date as a proportion of the total 
efforts or costs to be expended. Efforts or costs 
expended have been used to measure progress 
towards completion. Provisions for estimated 
losses, if any, on uncompleted contracts are 
recorded in the period in which such losses 
become probable based on the expected contract 
estimates at the reporting date.
	
	
ii.	
Income taxes 
	
	
	
The Company’s major tax jurisdictions is India, 
though the Company also files tax returns in other 
overseas jurisdictions. Significant judgements 
are involved in determining the provision for 
income taxes.
	
	
	
The Company reviews carrying amount of deferred 
tax assets at the end of each reporting period. 
	
	
iii.	
Property, plant and equipment
	
	
	
Property, plant and equipment represent a 
significant proportion of the asset base of the 
Company. The charge in respect of depreciation 
is derived after determining an estimate of an 
asset’s expected useful life and the expected 
residual value at the end of its life. The useful 
lives and residual values of Company’s assets are 
determined by management at the time the asset 
is acquired and reviewed periodically. The lives are 
based on historical experience with similar assets 
as well as anticipation of future events, which may 
impact their life, such as changes in technology.
	
	
iv.	
Leases
	
	
	
The 
Company 
considers 
extension-options 
under the commercial contract for determining 
the lease-term which forms the basis for the 
measurement of right-of-use asset and the 
corresponding lease-liability.
	
	
v.	
Impairment of investments
	
	
	
The Company reviews its carrying value of 
investments at each Balance Sheet date, or more 
frequently when there is an indication of impairment. 
If the recoverable amount is less than its carrying 
amount, the impairment loss is accounted for.
	
	
vi.	
Employee benefit plans
	
	
	
The present value of provision for gratuity and 
compensated absence is based on actuarial 
valuation using the projected unit credit method. An 
actuarial valuation involves various assumptions 
that may differ from actual developments in 
the future. These include the determination of 
the discount rate, future salary increases and 
mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved 
in the valuation and its long-term nature, provision 
for gratuity and compensated absence is highly 
sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All 
assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.
	
	
Recent accounting pronouncements
	
	
Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new 
standard or amendments to the existing standards 
under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 
Rules as issued from time to time. On March 31, 2023, 
MCA amended the Companies (Indian Accounting 
Standards) Rules, 2015 by issuing the Companies 
(Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2023. 
These amendments are applicable to the Company 
for the financial year starting January 01, 2024. The 
Company does not expect these amendments to have 
any significant impact in its financial statements.
	
	
a.	
Ind AS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements
	
	
	
The amendments require companies to disclose 
their material accounting policies rather than their 
significant accounting policies. Accounting policy 
information, together with other information, is 
material when it can reasonably be expected to 
influence decisions of primary users of general 
purpose financial statements. 
	
	
b.	
Ind AS 12 – Income Taxes
	
	
	
The 
amendments 
clarify 
how 
companies 
account for deferred tax on transactions such 
as leases and decommissioning obligations. 
The amendments narrowed the scope of the 
recognition exemption in paragraphs 15 and 
24 of Ind AS 12 (recognition exemption) so 
that it no longer applies to transactions that, on 
initial recognition, give rise to equal taxable and 
deductible temporary differences. 
	
	
c.	
Ind AS 8 – Accounting Policies, Changes in 
Accounting Estimates and Errors
	
	
	
The amendments will help entities to distinguish 
between accounting policies and accounting 
estimates. The definition of a change in 
accounting estimates has been replaced with 
a definition of accounting estimates. Under 
the new definition, accounting estimates are 
“monetary amounts in financial statements 
that are subject to measurement uncertainty”. 
Entities 
develop 
accounting 
estimates 
if 
accounting policies require items in financial 
statements to be measured in a way that involves 
measurement uncertainty.

Notes:
	
1.	
The Company had granted loans aggregating to H 152.00 million (SGD 3.80 million) to R Systems Consulting Services 
Limited (formerly known as ECnet Limited) a subsidiary of the Company. These loans were disbursed over the period 2004 
to 2010. R Systems Consulting Services Limited had accumulated losses which were in excess of its share capital as at 31

During the year ended 31 December, 2010, the Board of Directors had approved a scheme for corporate restructuring of its 
two subsidiaries based in Singapore viz R Systems Consulting Services Limited (formerly known as ECnet Limited) and R 
Systems (Singapore) Pte Limited. The proposed corporate restructuring involves conversion of loan by the Company to R 
Systems Consulting Services Limited (formerly known as ECnet Limited) into equity investment and thereafter amalgamation 
of both these subsidiaries.
	
	
During the year ended December 31, 2011, the loan of H 152.00 million (SGD 3.80 million) given by the Company to R Systems 
Consulting Services Limited (formerly known as ECnet Limited) was converted into equity share of R Systems Consulting 
Services Limited at the fair value of H Nil. Further, in subsequent years the proposed amalgamation was called off.
	
	
The Company had prepared its first financial statements as per India Accounting Standards (Ind AS) for the year ended 31 
December, 2018. In accordance with Ind AS 101, the Company had availed exemption in respect of investments in subsidiaries 
whereby the Company had opted to value its investments in subsidiaries as per previous GAAP and use the cost as per previous 
GAAP at the date of transition as deemed cost. The Company had valued the above-mentioned investments as at 01 January, 
2017 at H Nil and was consequently not included in the value of investments made in R Systems Consulting Services Limited.

(“Velotio”) at a consideration of H 2,693.74 million. Out of this, H 2,637.07 million has been paid and balance H 56.67 million is 
payable as at December 31, 2023. Further, the previous shareholders of Velotio hold 123,850 outstanding optionally convertible 
redeemable preference shares (“OCRPS”) which are valued at H 2,407.00 million based on terms and conditions stated in

of Velotio. The Company may at a later stage, as may be approved by its board of directors, acquire such OCRPS, subject 
to the terms and conditions set out in the SHA. Velotio holds 40% equity shares in Scaleworx Technologies Private Limited 
("ScaleWorx").

22.	 Revenue from operations (Contd.)
	
Trade receivables and contract balances
	
The company classifies the right to consideration in exchange for deliverables as either receivable or as unbilled revenue.
	
A rec	eivable is right to consideration that is unconditional upon passage of time. Revenue for time and material contracts are 
recognised as related service are performed. Revenue for fixed price maintenance contracts is recognised on a straight line basis 
over the period of contract. Revenue in excess of billing is recorded as unbilled revenue and is classified as a financial asset for 
these cases as right to consideration is unconditional upon passage of time.
	
Revenue recognition for fixed price development contracts is based on percentage of completion method. Invoicing to clients 
is based on milestones as defined in the contract. This would result in timing of revenue recognition being different from the 
timing of billing the customers. Unbilled revenue for fixed price development contracts is classified as non financial assets as the 
contractual right to consideration is dependent on completion of contractual milestones.
	
Invoicing in excess of earnings is classified as unearned revenue.
	
Trade receivables and unbilled revenues are presented net of impairment in Balance Sheet.
	
Performance obligations and remaining performance obligations
	
The remaining performance obligation disclosures provide the aggregate amount of transaction price yet to be recognised as 
of the end of the reporting period and an explanation as to when the Company expects to recognise these amounts as revenue. 
Applying the practical expedients as given in IND AS 115, the Company has not disclosed the remaining performance obligations 
related disclosures where the revenue recognised corresponds directly with the value to customer of the entity’s performance 
completed to date, typically those contracts where invoicing is on the basis of time-and-material basis. Remaining performance 
obligation estimates are subject to change and are affected by several factors, including terminations, changes in the scope of 
contracts, periodic revalidations, adjustment of revenue that has not materialised and adjustments for currency.
	
Disclosure relating to remaining performance obligation relating to fixed bid price contracts require the aggregate amounts of 
transaction price yet to be recognised as revenue at the reporting date and expected timelines to recognise these amounts. 
In view of the fact that all outstanding contracts have an original expected duration for completion of less than a year no 
disclosure is warranted.

Fair value hierarchy:
	
The fair value hierarchy is based on inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value that are either observable or 
unobservable and consists of the following three levels:
	
Level 1   -  Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
	
Level 2   -  Inputs are other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. 
as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
	
Level 3   -  Inputs are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Fair values are determined in whole or in part 
using a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices from observable current market transactions 
in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data.
	
There have been no transfers among Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 during the year.
31.	 Financial risk management
	
Financial risk factors and risk management objectives
	
The Company’s activities expose it to market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company’s primary focus is to foresee the 
unpredictability of financial markets and seek to minimise potential adverse effects on its financial performance.
	
The Board of Directors reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below:
	
Market risk
	
The primary market risk to the Company is foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk. The Company uses derivative financial 
instruments to mitigate foreign exchange related risk exposures. All derivative activities for risk management purposes are carried 
out by team that has the appropriate skills, experience coupled with appropriate supervision. It is the Company’s policy that no 
trading in derivative for speculative purposes shall be undertaken.
	
Foreign currency risk
	
The Company’s exchange risk arises from its foreign currency revenues (primarily in U.S. Dollars). A significant portion of the 
Company’s revenues are in foreign currencies, while a significant portion of its costs are in Indian Rupees. As a result, if the 
value of the Indian Rupee appreciates relative to these foreign currencies, the Company’s revenues measured in Rupees may 
decrease or vice versa.
	
Derivative financial instruments
	
The Company holds foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency 
exposures. These derivative financial instruments are valued based on quoted prices for similar assets in active markets or inputs 
that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace. The Company has not applied hedge accounting as these forward 
contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting. As at December 31, 2023, the Company has recognised mark-to-market asset of 
H 9.86 million (previous year: mark-to-market liability of H 98.06 million) relating to aforesaid foreign currency forward contracts

Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
	
For the year ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, every percentage point depreciation / appreciation in the 
exchange rate between the Indian rupee and foreign currencies, would decrease / increase Company’s profit before tax margin by 
approximately 1.00% and 1.74%, respectively.
	
Interest rate risk	
	 	
	
	
	
	
Interest rate risk is measured by using the cash flow sensitivity for changes in variable interest rates. Any movement in the reference 
rates could have an impact on the Company cash flows as well as costs. The Company has availed floating rate borrowings in 
the form of working capital demand loan and cash credit facility. For the year ended December 31, 2023, every one percentage 
increase / decrease in interest rates, would result in decrease / increase Company’s profit before tax margin by approximately 
0.25%. There were no floating rate borrowings in the previous year.
	
Credit risk
	
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its 
contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Company’s receivables from customers and investment securities. Credit 
risk arises from deposits held with banks, investments with financial institutions, as well as credit exposure to clients. The maximum 
exposure to credit risk is equal to the carrying value of the financial assets. The objective of managing counterparty credit risk 
is to prevent losses in financial assets. The Company assesses the credit quality of the counterparties, taking into account their 
financial position, past experience and other factors.

31.	 Financial risk management (Contd.)
	
Trade receivables
	
The Company’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The demographics 
of the customer, including the default risk of the industry and country in which the customer operates, also has an influence on 
credit risk assessment.
	
The following table gives details in respect of revenues generated from top customer and top 5 customers:

No customer accounted for more than 10% of the revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Further, 
no customer accounted for more than 10% of the receivable as at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.
	
Investments including bank deposits
	
Credit risk on bank balances is limited as the Company generally invests in deposits with banks. The Company does not expect any 
losses from non-performance by the counterparties.
	
Liquidity risk
	
Liquidity risk refers to the risk that the Company cannot meet its financial obligations. The objective of liquidity risk management 
is to maintain sufficient liquidity and ensure that funds are available for use as per requirements. The Company’s principal sources 
of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents and the cash flow that is generated from operations. The Company believes that the 
working capital is sufficient to meet its current requirements.
	
As at December 31, 2023, the Company had a working capital of H 608.86 million including cash and cash equivalents and current 
fixed deposits of H 440.72 million. As at December 31, 2022, the Company had a working capital of H 2,210.52 million including cash 
and cash equivalents and current fixed deposits of H 1,059.92 million and current investments of H 138.65 million. Accordingly, no 
liquidity risk is perceived.

Independent Auditors’ Report
To The Members of R Systems International Limited
Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial 
statements of R Systems International Limited (”the Parent”) and 
its subsidiaries (the  Parent and its subsidiaries together referred 
to as “the Group”) which includes the Group’s share of loss in its 
associate, which comprise the Consolidated Balance Sheet as 
at 31 December, 2023, the Consolidated Statement of Profit and 
Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Consolidated 
Statement of Cash Flows and the Consolidated Statement of 
Changes in Equity for the year then ended, and a summary of 
significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according 
to the explanations given to us and based on the consideration 
of reports of the other auditors on separate financial statements 
of the subsidiaries and associate referred to in the Other Matters 
section below the aforesaid consolidated financial statements 
give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (“the 
Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in 
conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed 
under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian 
Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended (‘Ind AS’), and 
other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the 
consolidated state of affairs of the Group as at 31 December, 
2023, and their consolidated profit, their consolidated total 
comprehensive income, their consolidated cash flows and their 
consolidated changes in equity for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under 
section 143 (10) of the Act (SAs). Our responsibilities under those 
Standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibility 
for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of 
our report. We are independent of the Group and of its associate 
in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of 
Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) together with the ethical 
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated 
financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the 
Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the 
ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence obtained 
by us and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in 
terms of their reports referred to in the Other Matters section 
below is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinion on the consolidated financial statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated 
financial statements of the current period. These matters were 
addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we 
do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Key Audit Matter
Auditor’s Response
1
The Company has completed a business combination 
during the year.
Ind AS 103 – Business Combinations, requires that 
consideration be given to the existence and measurement 
of separable identifiable intangible assets that have 
been acquired as part of each business combination. 
A significant proportion of the purchase price has been 
attributed to goodwill and other identified intangible assets, 
the valuation of which is dependent on cash flow forecasts 
including future business growth and the application of an 
appropriate discount rate, which are inherently subjective 
and therefore an area of focus for audit.
Our audit procedures on accounting for business combinations 
include the following:
 
 
Evaluated the design and implementation of the processes 
and internal controls relating to accounting for the 
business combination;
 
 
Obtained the cash flow forecasts supporting the valuation 
of the intangible assets identified and assessed if these 
are reasonable;
 
 
We along with our valuation specialists evaluated the 
reasonableness of methodology and key assumptions 
used by management along with their external valuers 
to value each intangible asset.  We also evaluated the

Information Other than the Financial Statements and 
Auditor’s Report Thereon
The Parent’s Board of Directors is responsible for the other 
information. The other information comprises the information 
included in the Parent’s annual report but does not include the 
consolidated financial statements, the standalone financial 
statements and our auditor’s report thereon. The Company’s 
annual report is expected to be made available to us after the 
date of this auditor's report.
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not 
cover the other information and we do not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read the other information 
when it becomes available and, , compare with the financial 
statements of the subsidiaries and associate, audited by the 
other auditors, to the extent it relates to these entities and, in 
doing so, place reliance on the work of the other auditors and 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent 
with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge 
obtained during the course of our audit or otherwise appears to 
be materially misstated.
When we read the annual report, if we conclude that there is a 
material misstatement therein, we shall communicate the matter 
to those charged with governance as required under SA 720 ‘The 
Auditor’s responsibilities Relating to Other Information.
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged 
with Governance for the Consolidated Financial 
Statements
The Parent’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters 
stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation 
of these consolidated financial statements that give a true and 
fair view of the consolidated financial position, consolidated 
financial performance including other comprehensive income, 
consolidated cash flows and consolidated changes in equity 
of the Group including its associate in accordance with the Ind 
AS and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. 
The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in 
the Group and its associate are responsible for maintenance of 
adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of 
the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Group and its associate 
and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; 
selection and application of appropriate accounting  policies; 
making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal 
financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the 
accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to 
the preparation and presentation of the financial statements that 
give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, which have been used for the 
purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial statements by 
the Directors of the Parent, as aforesaid.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the respective 
Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and 
of its associate are responsible for assessing the ability of the 
respective entities to continue as a going concern, disclosing, 
as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the 
going concern basis of accounting unless the respective Board 
of Directors either intends to liquidate their respective entities or 
to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in 
the Group and of its associate are also responsible for overseeing 
the financial reporting process of the Group and of its associate.
Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to 
issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that 
an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise 
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or 
in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
consolidated financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:
 
 
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of 
the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud 
or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive 
to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The 
risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting 
from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as 
fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
 
 
Obtain an understanding of internal financial control relevant to 
the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate 
in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are 
also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the 
Parent has adequate internal financial controls system in place 
and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
 
 
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used 
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and 
related disclosures made by the management.
 
 
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of 
the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the 
audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists 
related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt 
on the ability of the Group to continue as a going concern. If we 
conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to 
draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures 
in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures 
are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are 
based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our 
auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may 
cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.

Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content 
of the consolidated financial statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial 
statements represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
 
 
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the 
financial information of the branch and entities within the 
Group and of its associate to express an opinion on the 
consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for 
the direction, supervision and performance of the audit 
of the financial statements of such branch and entities 
included in the consolidated financial statements of which 
we are the independent auditors. For the other entities 
included in the consolidated financial statements, which 
have been audited by the other auditors, such other auditors 
remain responsible for the direction, supervision and 
performance of the audits carried out by them. We remain 
solely responsible for our audit opinion.
Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the consolidated 
financial statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes 
it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably 
knowledgeable user of the consolidated financial statements may 
be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative 
factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating 
the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified 
misstatements in the consolidated financial statements.
We communicate with those charged with governance of the 
Parent and other entities included in the consolidated financial 
statements of which we are the independent auditors regarding, 
among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the 
audit and significant audit findings, including any significant 
deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement 
that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding 
independence, and to communicate with them all relationships 
and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements 
of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. 
We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or 
regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, 
in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter 
should not be communicated in our report because the adverse 
consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to 
outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
Other Matters
We did not audit the financial statements of 25 subsidiaries whose 
financial statements reflect total assets of H 2,788.81 million as at 
31 December, 2023, total revenues of H 5,182.52 million, total net 
profit after tax of H 191.74 million, total comprehensive income 
of H 204.83 million and net cash inflows of H 208.8 million for 
the year ended on that date, as considered in the consolidated 
financial statements. The consolidated financial statements also 
include the Group’s share of net loss after tax of H 5.04 million 
for the year ended 31 December 2023, as considered in the 
consolidated financial statements, in respect of 1 associate, whose 
financial statements have not been audited by us. These financial 
statements have been audited by the other auditors whose reports 
have been furnished to us by the Management and our opinion on 
the consolidated financial statements, in so far as it relates to the 
amounts and disclosures included in respect of these subsidiaries 
and our report in terms of subsection (3) of Section 143 of the Act, 
in so far as it relates to the aforesaid subsidiaries is based solely on 
the reports of the other auditors.

NOTICE
Annexure “A” to the Independent Auditor’s Report 
(Referred to in paragraph 1(f) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ 
section of our report of even date) 
Report on the Internal Financial Controls with reference to consolidated financial statements 
under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)
In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements of the Parent as of and for the year ended 31 
December, 2023, we have audited the internal financial controls 
with reference to consolidated financial statements of the Parent 
and its subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated 
in India, as of that date.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial 
Controls
The respective Board of Directors of the Parent and its subsidiary 
companies, which are companies incorporated in India, are 
responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial 
controls with reference to consolidated financial statements based 
on “the internal control with reference to consolidated financial 
statements  criteria established by the respective Companies 
considering the essential components of internal control stated 
in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls 
Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India (ICAI)”. These responsibilities include the 
design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal 
financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the 
orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence 
to the respective company’s policies, the safeguarding of its 
assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the 
accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the 
timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required 
under the Companies Act, 2013.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal financial 
controls with reference to consolidated financial statements of 
the Parent and its subsidiary companies, which are companies 
incorporated in India, based on our audit. We conducted our 
audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal 
Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) 
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and 
the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under Section 143(10) of 
the Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an audit of 
internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial 
statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that 
we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the 
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate 
internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial 
statements was established and maintained and if such controls 
operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls 
with reference to consolidated financial statements and their 
operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls 
with reference to consolidated financial statements included 
obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with 
reference to consolidated financial statements, assessing the 
risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating 
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based 
on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the 
auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of 
material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due 
to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the 
audit evidence obtained by the other auditors of the subsidiary 
company, which is company incorporated in India, in terms of 
their reports referred to in the Other Matters paragraph below, is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion 
on the  internal financial controls with reference to consolidated 
financial statements  of the Parent and its subsidiary companies, 
which are companies incorporated in India.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference 
to consolidated financial statements
A company's internal financial control with reference to 
consolidated financial statements is a process designed to 
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial 
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external 
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles. A company's internal financial control with reference 
to consolidated financial statements includes those policies and 
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in 
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and 
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable 
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to 
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and 
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance 
with authorisations of management and directors of the company; 
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or 
timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition 
of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the 
financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls 
with reference to consolidated financial statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls 
with reference to consolidated financial statements, including 
the possibility of collusion or improper management override of 
controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur 
and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the 
internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial 
statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the 
R Systems International Limited 
Annual Report 2023
196
internal financial control with reference to consolidated financial 
statements may become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or 
procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In  our opinion to the best of our information and according to 
the explanations given to us and based on the consideration of 
the reports of the other auditors referred to in the Other Matters 
paragraph below, the Parent and its subsidiary companies, 
which are companies incorporated in India, have, in all material 
respects, an adequate internal financial controls with reference 
to consolidated financial statements  and such internal financial 
controls with reference to consolidated financial statements 
were operating effectively as at 31 December, 2023, based on the 
criteria for internal financial control with reference to consolidated 
financial statements established by the respective companies 
considering the essential components of internal control stated 
in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls 
Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India.
Other Matters
Our aforesaid report under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on the 
adequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal financial 
controls with reference to consolidated financial statements in 
so far as it relates to 1 subsidiary company, which is company 
incorporated in India, is based solely on the corresponding report 
of the auditors of such company incorporated in India.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of the above matters.

Significant Accounting Policies
2.1	 Basis of preparation and presentation
	
(a)	
Statement of compliance
	
	
The consolidated financial statements of the Group 
have been prepared in accordance with Indian 
Accounting Standards (Ind AS) prescribed under 
Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (‘the Act’) 
read with Companies (Indian Accounting Standard) 
Rules as amended from time to time.
	
	
The Group has consistently applied accounting 
policies to all periods except where a newly issued 
accounting standard is initially adopted or a revision to 
an existing accounting standard requires a change in 
the accounting policy hitherto in use.
	
(b)	
Functional and presentation currency
	
	
Items 
included 
in 
the 
consolidated 
financial 
statements of each of the Company’s subsidiaries are 
measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which these entities operate (i.e. the 
“functional currency”). The Group uses the Indian Rupee 
(INR) as its reporting currency, which is the functional 
currency of the Parent Company. All amounts have 
been presented in nearest million and rounded off upto 
two decimal places, unless otherwise indicated.
	
(c)	
Basis of preparation and presentation
	
	
The consolidated financial statements of the Group 
have been prepared under the historical cost convention 
on an accrual basis except for certain financial 
R Systems International Limited 
Annual Report 2023
204
Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2023
instruments, contingent consideration, net defined 
benefit obligations and other long term employee 
benefits, which have been measured at fair value. 
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of 
consideration given in exchange of goods and services. 
	
	
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell 
an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly 
transaction between market participants at the 
measurement date, regardless of whether that price is 
directly observable or estimated using another valuation 
technique. In estimating the fair value of an asset or a 
liability, the Group takes into account the characteristics 
of the asset or liability if market participants would take 
those characteristics into account when pricing the 
asset or liability at the measurement date. 
	
	
In addition, for financial reporting purposes, fair value 
measurements are categorised into Level 1, 2, or 3 
based on the degree to which the inputs to the fair value 
measurements are observable and the significance of 
the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety, 
which are described as follows:
	
	
Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active 
markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity 
can access at the measurement date;
	
	
Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices 
included within Level 1, that are observable for the 
asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and
	
	
Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the 
asset or liability.
	
	
Based on the nature of services rendered to customers 
and the time elapsed between deployment of resources 
and the realisation in cash and cash equivalents of the 
consideration of the services rendered, the Group has 
determined its operating cycle as 12 months for the 
purpose of classification of its assets and liabilities as 
current and non-current.
2.2	 Principles of consolidation
	
The consolidated financial statements are prepared in 
accordance with the principles and procedures for the 
preparation and presentation of consolidated financial 
statements as laid down under Indian Accounting Standard 
(Ind AS) 110 Consolidated Financial Statements.
	
The consolidated financial statements include the financial 
statements of R Systems International Limited and its 
subsidiaries (as explained in note 1 above).
	
The consolidated financial statements are prepared using 
uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other 
events in similar circumstances and are presented, to the 
extent possible, in the same manner as the Company's 
standalone financial statements. The Group follows uniform 
accounting year i.e. January to December.
	
The financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries 
have been consolidated on a line-by-line basis by adding together 
the book values of like items of assets, liabilities, income and 
expenses after eliminating intra-group balances / transactions.
	
Minority interest's share in the net comprehensive income of 
consolidated subsidiaries for the year is identified and adjusted 
against the income of the group in order to arrive at the net 
income attributable to shareholders of the Company. In case 
the losses applicable to consolidated minority are in excess 
of minority interest in the equity of the subsidiary, the excess, 
and any further losses applicable to the minority are adjusted 
against majority interest except to the extent minority has a 
binding obligation to, and is able to, make good losses. If the 
subsidiary subsequently reports profit, all such profits are 
allocated to the majority interest until the minority's share of 
losses previously absorbed by the majority has been recovered.
2.3	 Summary of significant accounting policies
	
(a)	
Property, plant and equipment
	
	
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, 
less accumulated depreciation and accumulated 
impairment losses, if any. The cost comprises the 
purchase price and directly attributable costs of 
bringing the asset to its working condition for its 
intended use. Any trade discounts and rebates are 
deducted in arriving at the purchase price. 
	
	
When part of an item of property, plant and equipment 
has different useful lives, they are accounted for as 
separate items (major component) of property, plant 
and equipment. Subsequent expenditure related to 
an item of property, plant and equipment is added 
to its book value only if it is probable that future 
economic benefits associated with the item will flow 
to the Group. All other expenses on existing property, 
plant and equipment, including day-to-day repair and 
maintenance expenditure and cost of replacing parts, 
are charged to the statement of profit and loss for the 
year during which such expenses are incurred.
	
	
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised 
upon disposal or when no future economic benefits 
are expected to arise from the continued use of 
the asset. Gains or losses arising from disposal 
or retirement of property, plant and equipment are 
measured as the difference between the net disposal 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are 
recognised in the statement of profit and loss when 
the asset is disposed.
	
	
Amounts paid towards the acquisition of property, plant 
and equipment not received till the reporting date and 
the cost of property, plant and equipment received

disclosed under capital advances and capital work-in-
progress (CWIP) respectively.
	
(b)	
Depreciation 
	
	
Depreciation is calculated on cost of items of property, 
plant and equipment and investment property less 
their estimated residual values using the straight line 
method over the useful lives of the assets estimated 
by the management. The assets residual values 
and useful lives are reviewed at each financial year 
end or whenever there are indicators for review, and 
adjusted prospectively.
	
	
The management believes that depreciation rates 
currently used fairly reflect its estimate of the useful 
lives and residual values are in align with Part C of 
Schedule II of the Companies Act 2013. 
	
	
The management estimates the useful lives are 
as follows:
Category

(c)	
Intangible assets
	
	
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on 
initial recognition at cost. Following initial recognition, 
intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, 
if any. 
	
	
Amortisation is recognised on a straight-line basis 
over their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful 
life is reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with 
the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted 
for on a prospective basis.
	
	
The management estimates the useful lives are 
as follows:
Category
Useful life upto
Computer software
Lower of license 
period or 3 to 5 years
Customer Contract
Over the 
period of contract

(d)	
Investment property 
	
	
Investment properties are properties held to earn 
rentals and/or for capital appreciation (including 
property under construction for such purposes). 
Investment properties are measured initially at cost, 
including transaction costs. Subsequent to initial 
recognition, investment properties are measured 
in accordance with requirements of Ind AS 16 
for cost model.
	
	
An investment property is derecognised upon disposal 
or when the investment property is permanently 
withdrawn from use and no future economic benefits 
are expected from the disposal. Any gain or loss 
arising on de-recognition of the property (calculated 
as the difference between the net disposal proceeds 
and the carrying amount of the asset) is included 
in profit or loss in the period in which the property 
is derecognised.
	
(e)	
Business combination, Goodwill and Intangible 
assets
	
	
Business combinations are accounted for using 
the purchase (acquisition) method. The cost of 
an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the 
assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities 
incurred or assumed at the date of exchange. The 
cost of acquisition also includes the fair value of any 
contingent consideration. Identifiable assets acquired 
and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a 
business combination are measured initially at their 
fair value on the date of acquisition.
	
	
Transaction costs incurred in connection with a 
business combination are expensed as incurred.
	
	
a.	
Goodwill
	
	
	
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the 
Group’s share in the fair value of the acquiree’s 
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities is recognised as goodwill. If the excess 
is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised 
in capital reserve.

Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2023
	
	
b.	
Intangible assets
	
	
	
Ind AS 103 requires the identifiable intangible 
assets and contingent consideration to be fair 
valued in order to ascertain the net fair value 
of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities of the acquiree. Significant estimates 
are required to be made in determining the 
value of contingent consideration and intangible 
assets. These valuations are conducted by 
independent valuation experts.
	
	
Business combinations arising from transfers of 
interest in entities that are under the control of 
the shareholder that controls the Company are 
accounted for using pooling of interest method as if 
the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of the 
earliest comparative period presented. The assets 
and liabilities acquired are recognised at their carrying 
amounts. The identity of the reserves is preserved and 
they appear in the financial statements of the Company 
in the same form in which they appeared in the financial 
statements of the transferor company. The difference, 
if any, between the amounts recorded as share capital 
issued plus any additional consideration in the form of 
cash or other assets and the amount of share capital 
of the transferor shall be transferred to capital reserve 
and should be presented separately as Capital reserve 
under common control.
	
(f)	
Financial instruments
	
	
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised 
when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instruments. 
	
	
Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially 
measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are 
directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of 
financial assets and financial liabilities (other than 
financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value 
through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the 
fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, 
as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction 
costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial 
assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit 
or loss are recognised immediately in profit or loss.
	
	
Offsetting of financial instruments
	
	
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the 
net amounts are presented in the standalone balance 
sheet when, and only when, the Company currently has 
a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it 
intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realize 
the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
	
(g)	
Financial assets
	
	
All regular way purchases or sales of financial assets 
are recognised and derecognised on a trade date 
basis. Regular way purchases or sales are purchases 
or sales of financial assets that require delivery of 
assets within the time frame established by regulation 
or convention in the marketplace.
	
	
All recognised financial assets are subsequently 
measured in their entirety at either amortised cost 
or fair value, depending on the classification of the 
financial assets.
	
	
Classification of financial assets
	
	
(i)	
Debt instruments that meet the following 
conditions are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost (except for debt instruments that 
are designated as at fair value through profit or 
loss on initial recognition):
	
	
	
-	
the asset is held within a business model 
whose objective is to hold assets in order to 
collect contractual cash flows; and
	
	
	
-	
the contractual terms of the instrument give 
rise on specified dates to cash flows that 
are solely payments of principal and interest 
on the principal amount outstanding.
	
	
(ii)	
Debt instruments that meet the following 
conditions are subsequently measured at fair 
value through other comprehensive income 
(FVTOCI) (except for debt instruments that are 
designated as at fair value through profit or loss 
on initial recognition):
	
	
	
-	
the asset is held within a business model 
whose objective is achieved both by 
collecting contractual cash flows and 
selling financial assets; and
	
	
	
-	
the contractual terms of the instrument give 
rise on specified dates to cash flows that 
are solely payments of principal and interest 
on the principal amount outstanding.
	
	
Interest income is recognised in profit or loss for FVTOCI 
debt instruments. For the purposes of recognising 
foreign exchange gains and losses, FVTOCI debt 
instruments are treated as financial assets measured 
at amortised cost. Thus, the exchange differences on 
the amortised cost are recognised in profit or loss and 
other changes in the fair value of FVTOCI financial 
assets are recognised in other comprehensive income 
and accumulated under the heading of ‘Reserve 
for debt instruments through other comprehensive 
income’. When the investment is disposed of, the

cumulative gain or loss previously accumulated in this 
reserve is reclassified to profit or loss.
	
	
All 
other 
financial 
assets 
are 
subsequently 
measured at fair value.
	
	
Effective interest method
	
	
The effective interest method is a method of calculating 
the amortised cost of a debt instrument and of 
allocating interest income over the relevant period. The 
effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts 
estimated future cash receipts (including all fees and 
points paid or received that form an integral part of 
the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other 
premiums or discounts) through the expected life of 
the debt instrument or where appropriate, a shorter 
period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.
	
	
Income is recognised on an effective interest basis 
for debt instruments other than those financial 
assets classified as at FVTPL. Interest income is 
recognised in profit or loss and is included in the “Other 
income” line item.
	
	
(iii)	 Investments in equity instruments at FVTOCI
	
	
	
On initial recognition, the Group can make 
an irrevocable election (on an instrument-by-
instrument basis) to present the subsequent 
changes in fair value in other comprehensive 
income pertaining to investments in equity 
instruments. This election is not permitted if 
the equity investment is held for trading. These 
elected investments are initially measured at fair 
value plus transaction costs. Subsequently, they 
are measured at fair value with gains and losses 
arising from changes in fair value recognised in 
other comprehensive income and accumulated 
in the ‘Reserve for equity instruments through 
other comprehensive income’. The cumulative 
gain or loss is not reclassified to profit or loss on 
disposal of the investments.
	
	
	
A financial asset is held for trading if:
	
	
	
-	
it has been acquired principally for the 
purpose of selling it in the near term; or
	
	
	
-	
on initial recognition it is part of a portfolio 
of identified financial instruments that the 
Group manages together and has a recent 
actual pattern of short-term profit-taking; or
	
	
	
-	
it is a derivative that is not designated and 
effective as a hedging instrument or a 
financial guarantee.
	
	
(iv)	 Financial assets at fair value through profit 
or loss (FVTPL)
	
	
	
Investments in equity instruments are classified 
as at FVTPL, unless the Group irrevocably elects 
on initial recognition to present subsequent 
changes in fair value in other comprehensive 
income for investments in equity instruments 
which are not held for trading.
	
	
	
Debt instruments that do not meet the amortised 
cost criteria or FVTOCI criteria (see above) are 
measured at FVTPL. In addition, debt instruments 
that meet the amortised cost criteria or the 
FVTOCI criteria but are designated as at FVTPL 
are measured at FVTPL.
	
	
	
A financial asset that meets the amortised cost 
criteria or debt instruments that meet the FVTOCI 
criteria may be designated as at FVTPL upon 
initial recognition if such designation eliminates 
or significantly reduces a measurement or 
recognition inconsistency that would arise from 
measuring assets or liabilities or recognising the 
gains and losses on them on different bases.
	
	
	
Financial assets at FVTPL are measured at fair value 
at the end of each reporting period, with any gains 
or losses arising on re-measurement recognised 
in profit or loss. The net gain or loss recognised in 
profit or loss incorporates any dividend or interest 
earned on the financial asset and is included in 
the ‘Other income’ line item. Dividend on financial 
assets at FVTPL is recognised when the Group’s 
right to receive the dividends is established, it is 
probable that the economic benefits associated 
with the dividend will flow to the Group, the 
dividend does not represent a recovery of part of 
cost of the investment and the amount of dividend 
can be measured reliably.
	
	
De-recognition of financial assets
	
	
The Group derecognises a financial asset when the 
contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset 
expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of 
the asset to another party. If the Group neither transfers 
nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership and continues to control the transferred 
asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in 
the asset and an associated liability for amounts it 
may have to pay. If the Group retains substantially all 
the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred 
financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the 
financial asset and also recognises a collateralised 
borrowing for the proceeds received.

On de-recognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the 
difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the 
sum of the consideration received and receivable and 
the cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised 
in other comprehensive income and accumulated in 
equity is recognised in profit or loss if such gain or loss 
would have otherwise been recognised in profit or loss 
on disposal of that financial asset.
	
	
Foreign exchange gains and losses
	
	
The fair value of financial assets denominated in a 
foreign currency is determined in that foreign currency 
and translated at the spot rate at the end of each 
reporting period.
	
	
(i)	
For foreign currency denominated financial 
assets measured at amortised cost and FVTPL, 
the exchange differences are recognised in profit 
or loss except for those which are designated as 
hedging instruments in a hedging relationship.
	
	
(ii)	
Changes in the carrying amount of investments 
in equity instruments at FVTOCI relating to 
changes in foreign currency rates are recognised 
in other comprehensive income.
	
	
(iii)	 For the purposes of recognising foreign exchange 
gains and losses, FVTOCI debt instruments 
are treated as financial assets measured at 
amortised cost. Thus, the exchange differences 
on the amortised cost are recognised in profit 
or loss and other changes in the fair value of 
FVTOCI financial assets are recognised in other 
comprehensive income.
	
(h)	
Financial liabilities 
	
	
For the purpose of subsequent measurement, financial 
liabilities are classified as:
	
	
-	
Financial liabilities at amortised cost
	
	
	
Financial liabilities are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest rate 
method. The change in measurements is recognised 
as finance costs in the statement of profit and loss.
	
	
-	
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit 
or loss (FVTPL)
	
	
	
Financial liabilities at FVTPL represented by 
contingent consideration are measured at fair 
value with all change recognised in the statement 
of profit and loss.
	
	
De-recognition of financial liabilities
	
	
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and 
only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, 
cancelled or have expired. 
	
(i)	
Impairment
	
	
i.	
Financial assets
	
	
	
The Group applies Expected Credit Loss (ECL) 
model for measurement and recognition of 
impairment loss on financial assets measured 
at amortised cost and financial assets that are 
debts instruments and are measured at fair value 
through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI). 
ECL is the difference between contractual cash 
flows that are due and the cash flows that the 
Group expects to receive, discounted at the 
original effective interest rate.
	
	
	
For trade receivables, the Group recognises 
impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ECL at 
each reporting date, right from its initial recognition. 
For other financial assets, the Group determines 
whether there has been a significant increase in the 
credit risk since initial recognition. If credit risk has 
not increased significantly, 12 month ECL is used to 
provide for impairment loss. However, if credit risk 
has increased significantly, lifetime ECL is used.
	
	
ii.	
Non-financial assets
	
	
	
The Group’s non-financial assets, excluding 
deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each balance 
sheet date or whenever there is any indication of 
impairment based on internal/external factors. 
If any indications exist, the Group estimates the 
asset’s recoverable amount.
	
	
	
An impairment loss is recognised wherever 
the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its 
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is 
the greater of the asset’s fair value and its value 
in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash flows are discounted to their present 
value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of 
money and risks specific to the asset.
	
(j)	
Derivative financial instruments
	
	
The Group enters into foreign exchange forward 
contracts to manage its exposure to foreign 
exchange rate risks. 
	
	
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the 
date the derivative contracts are entered into and are 
subsequently re-measured to their fair value at the end 
of each reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is 
recognised in profit or loss immediately unless the 
derivative is designated and effective as a hedging 
instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition 
in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedging 
relationship and the nature of the hedged item.

Hedge accounting
	
	
The Group designates certain hedging instruments, 
which include derivatives, embedded derivatives and 
non-derivatives in respect of foreign currency risk, as 
either fair value hedges or cash flow hedges. Hedges 
of foreign exchange risk on firm commitments are 
accounted for as cash flow hedges.
	
	
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the entity 
documents the relationship between the hedging 
instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk 
management objectives and its strategy for undertaking 
various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception 
of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group 
documents whether the hedging instrument is highly 
effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows 
of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.
	
	
Fair value hedges
	
	
Changes in fair value of the designated portion of 
derivatives that qualify as fair value hedges are 
recognised in profit or loss immediately, together with 
any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or 
liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. The 
change in the fair value of the designated portion of 
hedging instrument and the change in the hedged item 
attributable to the hedged risk are recognised in profit 
or loss in the line item relating to the hedged item.
	
	
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging 
instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, 
or when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. 
The fair value adjustment to the carrying amount of the 
hedged item arising from the hedged risk is amortised 
to profit or loss from that date.
	
	
Cash flow hedges
	
	
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of 
derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow 
hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income 
and accumulated under the heading of cash flow hedging 
reserve. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion 
is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
	
	
Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive 
income and accumulated in equity relating to (effective 
portion as described above) are reclassified to profit or 
loss in the periods when the hedged item affects profit 
or loss, in the same line as the recognised hedged item. 
However, when the hedged forecast transaction results 
in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-
financial liability, such gains and losses are transferred 
from equity (but not as a reclassification adjustment) 
and included in the initial measurement of the cost of 
the non-financial asset or non-financial liability.
	
	
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging 
instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, 
or when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. 
Any gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive 
income and accumulated in equity at that time 
remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast 
transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss. 
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected 
to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is 
recognised immediately in profit or loss.
	
(k)	
Borrowing costs
	
	
Borrowing costs are interest and other costs incurred 
in connection with the borrowing of funds and interest 
on lease liabilities. Borrowing costs directly attributable 
to the acquisition, construction or development of 
an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period 
of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are 
capitalised as part of the cost of that asset. All other 
borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the 
period in which they are incurred.
	
(l)	
Leases
	
	
Where the Group is a lessee
	
	
The Group lease asset classes primarily consist of 
leases for land, buildings, computer hardware and 
furniture. The Group, at the inception of a contract, 
assesses whether the contract is a lease or not lease. A 
contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys 
the right to control the use of an identified asset for a 
time in exchange for a consideration. 
	
	
To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control 
the use of an identified asset, the Group assesses whether: 
(i) the contract involves the use of an identified asset (ii) 
the Group has substantially all of the economic benefits 
from use of the asset through the period of the lease and 
(iii) the Group has the right to direct the use of the asset.
	
	
The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a 
lease liability at the lease commencement date. The 
right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which 
comprises the initial amount of the lease liability 
adjusted for any lease payments made at or before 
the commencement date, plus any initial direct 
costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle 
and remove the underlying asset or to restore the 
underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less 
any lease incentives received. 
	
	
The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated 
from the commencement date on a straight-line basis 
over the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the 
underlying asset. The estimated useful lives of right-of-
use assets are determined on the same basis as those 
of property, plant and equipment.
R Systems International Limited 
Annual Report 2023
210
Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2023
	
	
The lease liability is initially measured at the present 
value of the future lease payments. The lease 
payments are discounted using the rate implicit in 
the lease or, if not readily determinable, using the 
incremental borrowing rate. It is remeasured when 
there is a change in future lease payments arising from 
a change in an index or rate or if the Group changes 
its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, 
extension or termination option. When the lease 
liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding 
adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the 
right-of-use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the 
carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been 
reduced to zero. 
	
	
The Group has opted for the practical expedient under 
Ind AS 116 Para 46A read with Para 46B which provides 
lessee an option not to assess COVID-19-related rent 
concession as a lease modification. Basis the practical 
expedient the Group has recorded lease rent concession 
under other income. The expedient initially allowed 
for COVID-19-related rent concessions to payments 
originally due on or before June 30, 2021 has been 
extended to June 30, 2022. Any lease concession received 
subsequent to June 30, 2022 has been accounted for as 
a lease modification and a corresponding adjustment is 
made to the carrying amount of the related right-of-use 
asset and lease liability.
	
	
The Group has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets 
and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have a lease 
term of 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets. 
The Group recognises the lease payments associated 
with these leases as an expense over the lease term. 
	
	
Lease liability and ROU asset have been separately 
presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments 
have been classified as financing activity under cash 
flows statements.
	
	
Where the Group is a lessor
	
	
Leases in which the Group does not transfer 
substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership 
of the asset are classified as operating leases. Assets 
comprising land and building which are subject to 
operating leases are included under non-current 
assets as investment property and are carried at cost 
less accumulated depreciation. Lease income on an 
operating lease is recognised in the statement of profit 
and loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
Costs, including depreciation, are recognised as an 
expense in the statement of profit and loss.
	
(m)	 Revenue 
	
	
The Group derives revenue primarily from software 
development and related services and business 
process outsourcing services. The Group recognises 
revenue when the performance obligations as 
promised have been satisfies with a transaction 
price and when where there is no uncertainty as to 
measurement or collectability of the consideration. 
	
	
The Group has applied the guidance in Ind AS 115, 
“Revenue from Contracts with Customers”, by applying 
the revenue recognition criteria for each distinct 
performance obligation. The arrangements with 
customers generally meet the criteria for considering 
these services as distinct performance obligations. 
For allocating the transaction price, the Group has 
measured the revenue in respect of each performance 
obligation of a contract at its relative standalone selling 
price. The Group accounts for volume discounts and 
pricing incentives to customers as a reduction of 
revenue based on the ratable allocation of the discounts 
/ incentives to each of the underlying performance 
obligation that corresponds to the progress by the 
customer towards earning the discount/ incentive.
	
	
Contract modifications are accounted for when 
additions, deletions or changes are approved either to 
the contract scope or contract price. The accounting for 
modifications of contracts involves assessing whether 
the services added to an existing contract are distinct 
and whether the pricing is at the standalone selling 
price. Services added that are not distinct are accounted 
for on a cumulative catch up basis, while those that are 
distinct are accounted for prospectively, either as a 
separate contract, if the additional services are priced 
at the standalone selling price, or as a termination of the 
existing contract and creation of a new contract if not 
priced at the standalone selling price.
	
	
The Group collects indirect taxes like Goods and Service Tax, 
value added taxes (VAT) etc. on behalf of the government 
and, therefore, these are not economic benefits flowing to 
the Group. Hence, they are excluded from revenue.
	
	
Arrangements with customers for services are 
either on a fixed-price, fixed-timeframe or on a time-
and-material basis.
	
	
Revenue 
on 
time-and-material 
contracts 
are 
recognised as the related services are performed 
and revenue from the end of the last invoicing to the 
reporting date is recognised as unbilled revenue.
	
	
Revenue 
from 
fixed-price 
and 
fixed-timeframe 
contracts, where the performance obligations are 
satisfied over time and where there is no uncertainty 
as to measurement or collectability of consideration, 
is recognised as per the percentage-of-completion 
method. When there is uncertainty as to measurement 
or ultimate collectability, revenue recognition is

postponed until such uncertainty is resolved. Efforts or 
costs expended have been used to measure progress 
towards completion as there is a direct relationship 
between input and productivity. Maintenance revenue 
is recognised ratably over the term of the underlying 
maintenance arrangement.
	
	
Revenue from licenses where the customer obtain a 
right to use are recognised at the time the licenses is 
made available to the customers.
	
	
Revenues in excess of invoicing are classified as 
contract assets (referred as unbilled revenue) while 
invoicing in excess of revenues are classified as 
contract liabilities (referred as unearned revenues).
	
	
Unbilled revenue for fixed price contracts are 
classified as non-financial asset if the contractual 
right to consideration is dependent on completion of 
contractual milestones. Unbilled revenue on contracts 
other than above is classified as a financial asset.
	
(n)	
Other Income
	
	
Other income is comprised primarily of interest income, 
net gain on foreign exchange fluctuations, rental 
income and gain on investments. Interest income 
is recognised on a time proportion basis taking into 
account the carrying amount and the effective interest 
rate. Dividend income is recognised when the Group’s 
right to receive dividend is established.
	
(o)	
Foreign currency transactions and balances 
	
	
Transactions in foreign currency are translated into the 
respective functional currencies using the exchange 
rates prevailing at the dates of the respective 
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses 
resulting from the settlement of such transactions and 
from the translation at the exchange rates prevailing 
at reporting date of monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are recognised 
in the consolidated statement of profit and loss and 
reported within foreign exchange gains/ (losses).
	
	
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a 
foreign currency and measured at historical cost are 
translated at the exchange rate prevalent at the date 
of transaction.
	
	
For the purposes of presenting the consolidated 
financial statements assets and liabilities of Group’s 
foreign operations with functional currency different 
from the Company are translated into Company’s 
functional currency i.e. INR using exchange rates 
prevailing at the end of each reporting period. Income 
and expense items are translated at the average 
exchange rates for the period. Exchange differences 
arising if any are recognised in other comprehensive 
income and accumulated in equity.
	
	
On the disposal of foreign operation, all of the exchange 
differences accumulated in equity in respect of that 
operation attributable to the owners of the Company 
are reclassified to the statement of profit and loss.
	
	
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the 
acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets 
and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the 
exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date.
	
	
For translating income, expense and cash flows items, 
during the year ended December 31, 2023, the rates 
used were US $ 1= H 82.57, Euro 1= H 89.29, Singapore 
$ 1 = H 61.47 and Canadian $ 1 = H 61.19. For translating 
assets and liabilities at the year-end, the rates used 
were US $ 1= H 83.21, Euro 1= H 91.95, Singapore $ 1 = 
H 63.00 and Canadian $ 1 = H 62.79.
	
	
For translating income, expense and cash flows items, 
during the year ended December 31, 2022, the rates 
used were US $ 1= H 78.47, Euro 1= H 82.56, Singapore 
$ 1 = H 56.91 and Canadian $ 1 = H 60.27. For translating 
assets and liabilities at the year-end, the rates used 
were US $ 1= H 82.73, Euro 1= H 88.14, Singapore $ 1 = 
H 61.66 and Canadian $ 1 = H 61.05. 
	
(p)	
Employee benefits
	
	
The Group participates in various employee benefit 
plans. Post-employment benefits are classified as either 
defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans. 
Under a defined contribution plan, the Group’s only 
obligation is to pay a fixed amount with no obligation 
to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold 
sufficient assets to pay all related employee benefits. 
The related risks fall on the employee. The expenditure 
for defined contribution plans is recognised as expense 
during the period when the employee provides service. 
Under a defined benefit plan, it is the Group’s obligation 
to provide agreed benefits to the employees. The related 
actuarial risks fall on the Group. The present value of 
the defined benefit obligations is calculated using the 
projected unit credit method.
	
	
(i)	
The Group's contribution to social security 
plans such as provident fund, employee state 
insurance scheme, 401K etc. are considered as 
defined contribution plans and are charged as 
an expense based on the amount of contribution 
required to be made and when services are 
rendered by the employees.
	
	
(ii)	
Gratuity is a defined benefit obligation plan 
operated by the Company and its Indian 
subsidiaries for its employees covered under 
R Systems International Limited 
Annual Report 2023
212
Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2023
Gratuity Scheme. The cost of providing benefit 
under gratuity plan is determined on the basis of 
actuarial valuation using the projected unit credit 
method at the reporting date and are charged 
to the statement of profit and loss except for 
the re-measurements comprising of actuarial 
gains and losses which are recognised in full in 
the statement of other comprehensive income 
in the reporting period in which they occur. Re-
measurements are not reclassified to statement 
of profit and loss subsequently. 
	
	
	
The provision for gratuity recognised in the 
balance sheet represents the present value of 
the defined benefit obligations reduced by the 
fair value of scheme assets, if any. 
	
	
(iii)	 Compensated absences
	
	
	
The employees of the Group are entitled to 
compensated 
absences. 
The 
employees 
of the Group can carry forward a portion of 
the 
unutilised 
accumulating 
compensated 
absences and utilise it in the future periods or 
receive cash at the retirement or termination of 
employment. The Group records an obligation for 
compensated absences in the period in which the 
employee renders the service that increases this 
entitlement. The Group measures the expected 
cost of compensated absences as the additional 
amount that the Group expects to pay as a result 
of the unused entitlement that has accumulated 
at the end of the reporting period.
	
	
	
Accumulated compensated absences which 
are expected to be availed or encashed within 
12 months from the end of the year are treated 
as short term employee benefits. The obligation 
towards the same is measured at the expected 
cost of accumulating compensated absences as 
the additional amount expected to be paid as a 
result of the unused entitlement as at the year end. 
	
	
	
Accumulating compensated absences which are 
expected to be availed or encashed beyond 12 
months from the end of the year are treated as other 
long term employee benefits. The Group’s liability 
is actuarially determined (using the Projected Unit 
Credit method) at the end of each year. Actuarial 
losses/ gains are recognised in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss in the year in which they arise. 
	
	
	
Non-accumulating 
compensated 
absences 
are recognised in the period in which the 
absences occur.
	
	
	
The Group presents the entire leave encashment 
liability as a current liability in the balance sheet, 
since it does not have an unconditional right to 
defer its settlement for twelve months after the 
reporting date.
	
(q)	
Income taxes
	
	
Tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. 
It is recognised in profit or loss except to the extent 
that it relates to a business combination or to 
an item recognised directly in equity or in other 
comprehensive income.
	
	
Current tax
	
	
Current income tax is measured at the amount 
expected to be paid to the tax authorities in accordance 
with the Income Tax Act, 1961 enacted in India and tax 
laws prevailing in the respective tax jurisdictions where 
the Group operates. The tax rates and tax laws used 
to compute the amount are those that are enacted or 
substantively enacted, at the reporting date. 
	
	
The Group off sets current tax assets and current tax 
liabilities only if there is a legally enforceable right to 
set off the recognised amounts, and it is intended to 
realise the asset and settle the liability on a net basis 
or simultaneously.
	
	
Deferred tax
	
	
Deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary 
differences between tax base of assets and liabilities 
and their carrying amounts. Deferred tax is measured 
based on the tax rates and the tax laws enacted or 
substantively enacted at the reporting date.
	
	
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences, except deferred tax liability 
arising from initial recognition of goodwill or an asset 
or liability in a transaction that is not a business 
combination and, affects neither accounting nor taxable 
profit/ loss at the time of transaction. Deferred tax assets 
are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, 
the carry forward of unused tax credits and any unused 
tax losses, except deferred tax assets arising from 
initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in 
a transaction that is not a business combination and, 
affects neither accounting nor taxable profit/ loss at the 
time of transaction. Deferred tax assets are recognised 
only to the extent that sufficient future taxable income 
will be available against which such deferred tax assets 
can be realised.
	
	
In the situations where the Group is entitled to a tax 
holiday under the Income-tax Act, 1961 enacted in India 
or tax laws prevailing in the respective tax jurisdictions 
where it operates, no deferred tax (asset or liability) is 
recognised in respect of temporary differences which 
reverse during the tax holiday period, to the extent the 
213
CORPORATE OVERVIEW
STATUTORY REPORTS
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTICE
Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2023
Group’s gross total income is subject to the deduction 
during the tax holiday period. Deferred tax in respect 
of temporary differences which reverse after the tax 
holiday period is recognised in the year in which the 
temporary differences originate.
	
	
The carrying amount of deferred tax asset is reviewed at 
each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available 
against which such deferred tax assets can be realised.
	
	
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset, 
if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax 
assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred 
tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to the same 
taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
	
	
Minimum alternate tax (MAT) paid in a year is charged 
to the statement of profit and loss as current tax. 
MAT credit available is recognised as an asset only to 
the extent that there is convincing evidence that the 
Company will pay normal income tax during the period, 
i.e., the period for which MAT credit is allowed to be 
carried forward. MAT credit asset is created by way of 
credit to the statement of profit and loss and shown as 
“MAT Credit Entitlement” under deferred tax assets.
	
(r)	
Government grants
	
	
Grants and subsidies from the government are 
recognised when there is reasonable assurance that 
the grant / subsidy will be received and all attaching 
conditions will be complied with.
	
	
When the grant or subsidy relates to an expense item, 
it is deducted in reporting the related expenses over 
the periods necessary to match them on a systematic 
basis to the costs, which it is intended to compensate. 
Grant or subsidy relating to expenses already incurred 
in previous years is recognised under other income.
	
(s)	
Segment reporting
	
	
The Group determines reportable segment based on 
information reported to the Chief Operating Decision 
Maker (CODM) for the purposes of resource allocation 
and assessment of segmental performance. The 
CODM evaluates the Group's performance and 
allocates resources based on an analysis of various 
performance indicators by business segments. The 
accounting principles used in the preparation of the 
financial statements are consistently applied to record 
revenue and expenditure in individual segments.
	
	
Each segment item reported is measured at the 
measure used to report to the CODM for the purposes 
of making decisions about allocating resources to the 
segment and assessing its performance.
	
	
Inter segment transfers:
	
	
The Group generally accounts for inter segment sales 
and transfers as if the sales or transfers were to third 
parties at current market prices.
	
	
Allocation of common costs:
	
	
Common allocable costs are allocated to each 
segment according to the relative contribution of each 
segment to the total common costs.
	
	
Unallocated items:
	
	
The corporate and other segment includes general 
corporate income and expense items which are not 
allocated to any business segment.
	
(t)	
Earnings per share (EPS)
	
	
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing 
the net profit for the year attributable to equity 
shareholders by the weighted average number of 
equity shares outstanding during the year. 
	
	
The weighted average number of equity shares 
outstanding during the reporting period is adjusted for 
events such as bonus issue, bonus element in a rights 
issue, share split, and reverse share split (consolidation 
of shares), if any occurred during the reporting 
period, that have changed the number of equity 
shares outstanding, without a corresponding change 
in resources. The number of shares and potential 
dilutive equity shares are adjusted retrospectively for 
all periods presented for any bonus shares issues 
including for changes effected prior to the approval of 
the financial statements by the Board of Directors. 
	
	
For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per 
share, the net profit for the year attributable to the equity 
shareholders and the weighted average number of 
equity shares outstanding during the year, are adjusted 
for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares.
	
(u)	
Share based payments
	
	
In accordance with Ind AS 102 – “Share Based Payments”, 
the cost of equity-settled transaction is determined by 
the fair value of the options at the date of the grant and 
recognised as employee compensation cost over the 
vesting period. The cumulative expense recognised for 
equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until 
the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting 
period has expired and the Group’s best estimate of the 
number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
	
	
The expense recognised in the statement of profit and 
loss for a year represents the movement in cumulative 
expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that 
year and is recognised in employee benefits expense. 
R Systems International Limited 
Annual Report 2023
214
Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2023
In case of the employee stock option schemes having 
a graded vesting schedule, each vesting tranche 
having different vesting period has been considered as 
a separate option grant and accounted for accordingly.
	
	
Where the terms of an equity-settled transaction 
award are modified, the minimum expense recognised 
is the expense as if the terms had not been modified, if 
the original terms of the award are met. An additional 
expense is recognised for any modification that 
increases the total fair value of the share-based 
payment transaction, or is otherwise beneficial to the 
employee as measured at the date of modification.
	
(v)	
Provisions
	
	
A provision is recognised when the Group has a present 
obligation as a result of past event; it is probable that 
an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits 
will be required to settle the obligation, in respect of 
which a reliable estimate can be made. Provisions are 
determined based on the best estimate required to 
settle the obligation at the reporting date. If the effect 
of time value of money is material, provisions are 
discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects 
the risks specific to the liability. These estimates are 
reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to 
reflect the current best estimates.
	
(w)	 Contingent liabilities
	
	
A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises 
from past events whose existence will be confirmed 
by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more 
uncertain future events beyond the control of the 
Group or a present obligation that is not recognised 
because it is not probable that an outflow of resources 
will be required to settle the obligation. A contingent 
liability also arises in extremely rare cases where 
there is a liability that cannot be recognised because it 
cannot be measured reliably.
	
(x)	
Cash and cash equivalents
	
	
Cash and cash equivalents in the cash flow statement 
comprises of cash at bank, cash in hand and short 
term deposits with an original maturity period of three 
months or less.
	
(y)	
Use of estimates and judgement
	
	
The preparation of the financial statements in 
conformity with Ind AS requires the management to 
make judgments, estimates and assumptions that 
affect the reported amounts of revenue, expenses, 
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent 
liabilities at the end of year. These estimates are based 
on the management’s best knowledge of current 
events, historical experience, actions that the Group 
may undertake in the future and on various other 
assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under 
the circumstances. Actual results could differ from 
those estimates. 
	
	
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed 
on a periodic basis. Revisions to accounting estimates 
are recognised in the period in which the estimates are 
revised and in any future periods affected.
	
	
Critical accounting estimates
	
	
i.	
Revenue recognition
	
	
	
The Group uses the percentage-of-completion 
method in accounting for its fixed-price contracts. 
Use of the percentage-of-completion method 
requires the Group to estimate the efforts or 
costs expended to date as a proportion of the 
total efforts or costs to be expended. Efforts 
or costs expended have been used to measure 
progress 
towards 
completion. 
Provisions 
for estimated losses, if any, on uncompleted 
contracts are recorded in the period in which such 
losses become probable based on the expected 
contract estimates at the reporting date.
	
	
ii.	
Income taxes 
	
	
	
The Group’s major tax jurisdiction is India, though 
the Group also files tax returns in other overseas 
jurisdictions. Significant judgements are involved 
in determining the provision for income taxes.
	
	
	
The Group reviews carrying amount of deferred 
tax assets / liabilities at the end of each 
reporting period. 
	
	
iii.	
Property, plant and equipment
	
	
	
Property, plant and equipment represent a 
significant proportion of the asset base of the 
Group. The charge in respect of depreciation is 
derived after determining an estimate of an asset’s 
expected useful life and the expected residual 
value at the end of its life. The useful lives and 
residual values of Group’s assets are determined 
by management at the time the asset is acquired 
and reviewed periodically. The lives are based on 
historical experience with similar assets as well as 
anticipation of future events, which may impact 
their life, such as changes in technology.
	
	
iv.	
Leases
	
	
	
The Group considers the extension-options 
under the commercial contract for determining 
the lease-term which forms the basis for the 
measurement of right-of-use asset and the 
corresponding lease-liability.

v.	
Impairment of goodwill
	
	
	
Goodwill recognised on business combination 
is tested for impairment annually or when 
events occur or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the recoverable amount of cash 
generating unit to which it pertains, is less than 
the carrying value. The recoverable amount of 
cash generating unit is higher of value-in-use and 
fair value less cost of disposal. The calculation of 
value-in-use of cash generating unit involves use 
of significant estimates and assumptions, which 
include turnover, growth rates and net margins 
used to calculate projected future cash flows, 
risk-adjusted discount rate, future economic and 
market conditions.
	
	
vi.	
Business Combination and Intangible Assets
	
	
	
Business combinations are accounted for 
using Ind AS 103, Business Combinations, 
which requires the acquirer to recognise the 
identifiable intangible assets and consideration 
at fair value. Estimates are required to be made 
in determining the value of consideration, value 
of option arrangements and intangible assets. 
These valuations are conducted by external 
valuation experts. These measurements are 
based on information available at the acquisition 
date and are based on expectations and 
assumptions that have been deemed reasonable 
by the Management.
	
	
vii.	
Employee benefit plans
	
	
	
The present value of provision for gratuity and 
other long-term employee benefit is based on 
actuarial valuation using the projected unit 
credit method. An actuarial valuation involved 
various assumptions that may differ from actual 
developments in the future. These include 
the determination of the discount rate, future 
salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the 
complexities involved in the valuation and its 
long-term nature, provision for gratuity and other 
long-term employee benefit is highly sensitive to 
changes in these assumptions. All assumptions 
are reviewed at each reporting date.
	
	
Recent accounting pronouncements
	
	
Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new 
standard or amendments to the existing standards 
under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 
Rules as issued from time to time. On March 31, 2023, 
MCA amended the Companies (Indian Accounting 
Standards) Rules, 2015 by issuing the Companies 
(Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 
2023. These amendments are applicable to the Group 
for the financial year starting January 01, 2024. The 
Group does not expect these amendments to have any 
significant impact in its financial statements.
	
	
a.	
Ind AS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements
	
	
	
The amendments require companies to disclose 
their material accounting policies rather than their 
significant accounting policies. Accounting policy 
information, together with other information, is 
material when it can reasonably be expected to 
influence decisions of primary users of general 
purpose financial statements. 
	
	
b.	
Ind AS 12 – Income Taxes
	
	
	
The 
amendments 
clarify 
how 
companies 
account for deferred tax on transactions such 
as leases and decommissioning obligations. 
The amendments narrowed the scope of the 
recognition exemption in paragraphs 15 and 
24 of Ind AS 12 (recognition exemption) so 
that it no longer applies to transactions that, on 
initial recognition, give rise to equal taxable and 
deductible temporary differences. 
	
	
c.	
Ind AS 8 – Accounting Policies, Changes in 
Accounting Estimates and Errors
	
	
	
The amendments will help entities to distinguish 
between accounting policies and accounting 
estimates. The definition of a change in 
accounting estimates has been replaced with a 
definition of accounting estimates. Under the new 
definition, accounting estimates are “monetary 
amounts in financial statements that are subject 
to measurement uncertainty”. Entities develop 
accounting estimates if accounting policies require 
items in financial statements to be measured in a 
way that involves measurement uncertainty.

on its historically observed default rates over the expected life of the trade receivable and is adjusted for forward-looking  estimates. 
At every reporting date, the historically observed default rates are updated and changes in forward-looking estimates are analysed. 
The Group estimates the following matrix at the reporting date.

Revenue by geography:
	
Revenue by customer’s industry type :
	
Trade receivables and contract balances
	
The Group classifies the right to consideration in exchange for deliverables as either receivable or as unbilled revenue.
	
A receivable is right to consideration that is unconditional upon passage of time. Revenue for time and material contracts are 
recognised as related service are performed. Revenue for fixed price maintenance contracts is recognised on a straight line basis 
over the period of contract. Revenue in excess of billing is recorded as unbilled revenue and is classified as a financial asset for 
these cases as right to consideration is unconditional upon passage of time.
	
Revenue recognition for fixed price development contracts is based on percentage of completion method. Invoicing to clients 
is based on milestones as defined in the contract. This would result in timing of revenue recognition being different from the 
timing of billing the customers. Unbilled revenue for fixed price development contracts is classified as non financial assets as the 
contractual right to consideration is dependent on completion of contractual milestones.
	
Invoicing in excess of earnings is classified as unearned revenue.
	
Trade receivables and unbilled revenues are presented net of impairment in Balance Sheet.
	
Performance obligations and remaining performance obligations
	
The remaining performance obligation disclosures provide the aggregate amount of transaction price yet to be recognised as of 
the end of the reporting period and an explanation as to when the Group expects to recognise these amounts as revenue. Applying 
the practical expedients as given in IND AS 115, the Group has not disclosed the remaining performance obligations related 
disclosures where the revenue recognised corresponds directly with the value to customer of the entity’s performance completed 
to date, typically those contracts where invoicing is on the basis of time-and-material basis. Remaining performance obligation 
estimates are subject to change and are affected by several factors, including terminations, changes in the scope of contracts, 
periodic revalidations, adjustment of revenue that has not materialised and adjustments for currency.
	
Disclosure relating to remaining performance obligation relating to fixed bid price contracts require the aggregate amounts of 
transaction price yet to be recognised as revenue at the reporting date and expected timelines to recognise these amounts. 
In view of the fact that all outstanding contracts have an original expected duration for completion of less than a year no 
disclosure is warranted.

Fair value hierarchy:
	
The fair value hierarchy is based on inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value that are either observable or 
unobservable and consists of the following three levels:
	
Level 1   -  Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
	
Level 2   -  Inputs are other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. 
as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
	
Level 3   -  Inputs are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Fair values are determined in whole or in part 
using a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices from observable current market transactions 
in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data.
	
There have been no transfers among Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 during the year.
31.	 Financial risk management
	
Financial risk factors and risk management objectives
	
The Group’s activities expose it to market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s primary focus is to foresee the unpredictability 
of financial markets and seek to minimise potential adverse effects on its financial performance.
	
The Board of Directors reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below:
	
Market risk
	
The primary market risk to the Group is foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk. The Group uses derivative financial instruments 
to mitigate foreign exchange related risk exposures. All derivative activities for risk management purposes are carried out by team 
that has the appropriate skills, experience coupled with appropriate supervision. It is the Group’s policy that no trading in derivative 
for speculative purposes shall be undertaken.
	
Foreign currency risk	
	
The Group’s exchange risk arises from its foreign currency revenues (primarily in U.S. Dollars). A significant portion of the Group’s 
revenues are in foreign currencies, while a significant portion of its costs are in Indian Rupees. As a result, if the value of the Indian 
Rupee appreciates relative to these foreign currencies, the Group’s revenues measured in Rupees may decrease or vice versa.

Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2023
	
Derivative financial instruments
	
The Group holds foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency exposures. 
These derivative financial instruments are valued based on quoted prices for similar assets in active markets or inputs that are 
directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace. The Group has not applied hedge accounting as these forward contracts do 
not qualify for hedge accounting. As at December 31, 2023, the Group has recognised mark-to-market assets (net) of H 9.40 million 
(previous year: mark-to-market liability of H 98.07 million) relating to aforesaid foreign currency forward contracts. Further, the 
group has acquired mark-to-market liability of H 1.63 million through Velotio acquisition (refer to Note 37). This resulted into mark-
to-market gain of H 109.10 million (previous year mark-to-market loss of H 149.87 million) for the year ended December 31, 2023 
recorded as foreign exchange fluctuation.

Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
	
For the year ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, every percentage point depreciation / appreciation in the exchange 
rate between the Indian rupee and foreign currencies, would decrease / increase Group’s profit before tax margin by approximately 
0.87% and 1.08%, respectively.
	
Interest rate risk
	
Interest rate risk is measured by using the cash flow sensitivity for changes in variable interest rates. Any movement in the reference 
rates could have an impact on the Group cash flows as well as costs. The Group has availed floating rate borrowings in the form 
working capital demand loan and cash credit facility. For the year ended December 31, 2023, every one percentage increase / 
decrease in interest rates, would result in decrease / increase Company’s profit before tax margin by approximately 0.28%. There 
were no floating rate borrowings in the previous year.

Credit risk
	
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its 
contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers and investment securities. Credit 
risk arises from deposits held with banks, investments with financial institutions, as well as credit exposure to clients, including 
outstanding accounts receivable. The maximum exposure to credit risk is equal to the carrying value of the financial assets. The 
objective of managing counterparty credit risk is to prevent losses in financial assets. The Group assesses the credit quality of the 
counterparties, taking into account their financial position, past experience and other factors.
	
Trade and other receivables
	
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The demographics of 
the customer, including the default risk of the industry and country in which the customer operates, also has an influence on credit 
risk assessment.
	
The following table gives details in respect of revenues generated from top customer and top 5 customers:

No customer accounted for more than 10% of the revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Further, 
there is one customer account for more than 10% of the receivable as at December 31, 2023 and one customer had more than 10% 
of the receivable as at December 31, 2022.
	
Investments including bank deposits
	
Credit risk on cash and bank balance is limited as the Group generally invests in deposits with banks. The Group does not expect 
any losses from non-performance by the counterparties.
	
Liquidity risk
	
Liquidity risk refers to the risk that the Group cannot meet its financial obligations. The objective of liquidity risk management is 
to maintain sufficient liquidity and ensure that funds are available for use as per requirements. The Group’s principal sources of 
liquidity are cash and cash equivalents and the cash flow that is generated from operations. The Group believes that the working 
capital is sufficient to meet its current requirements.
	
As at December 31, 2023, the Group had a working capital of H 2,578.80 million including cash and cash equivalents and current 
fixed deposits of H 1,822.94 million . As at December 31, 2022, the Group had a working capital of H 4,321.74 million including cash 
and cash equivalents and current fixed deposits of H 2,534.76 million and current investments of H 138.65 million. Accordingly, no 
liquidity risk is perceived.
