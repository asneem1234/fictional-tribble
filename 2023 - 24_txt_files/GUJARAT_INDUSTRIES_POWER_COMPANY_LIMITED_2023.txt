Risk 
Increase 
in 
temperature 
and 
prolonged heat waves 
may 
create 
unsafe 
environment 
and 
cause health & safety 
risks for the workforce 
The risk is minimised as most 
of the mining operations are 
mechanised 
with 
minimal 
human tasks in the open 
environment. 
All 
equipment/machinery 
are 
operated have air conditioned 
cabins. 
In case of power generation 
operations, 
the 
Company 
maintains 
infrastructure 
to 
reduce impact of extreme heat. 
Adequate 
sheds 
are 
also 
installed to provide places for 
workers 
to 
rest 
and 
for 
protection from outside heat.

Water scarcity
Risk
Water scarcity & less
rainfall/droughts might
impact the production
processes as water is 
one 
of 
the 
main 
resources 
consumed 
by the company 
The Company has access to
various water sources to enable

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your
company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted
to manage such wastes.
The Company follows a robust waste management practice with the aim of reducing, reusing or recycling the waste generated
from its operations. Electricity generation from solar power, wind mills and gas do not generate any specific waste to reclaim.
Fly ash is the key waste generated as part of the electricity generation from thermal sources. There are procedures in place
where the Company captures 100% of the fly ash generated which is then onward sold to the companies in real estate
sector for use in producing green cement/concrete mix. The Company does not generate any other hazardous or toxic waste
as part of its operations.
The Company continues to win awards at pan-India level for its fly ash management processes being implemented across
