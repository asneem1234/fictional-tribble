a)	
Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Yes/No). 
If yes, the coverage of such system?
	
	
Yes, an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity. We have established 
various internal committees, such as the Worker Welfare Committee (WWC), Health and Safety Committee (HSC), 
and Sexual Harassment Committee (SHC), which convene quarterly and maintain thorough records. Our system 
complies with the Indian Factories Act of 1948, the GDD Factory Rules of 1985, the Gujarat Factory Rules of 1963, 
and adheres to standards such as ISO 9001:2015 and the Social Accountability 8000 (SA8000®:2014) Standard.
	
b)	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis 
by the entity?
	
	
To identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis, we have implemented several 
key processes. We conduct regular inspections and document certifications for all internal vehicles, including 
forklifts, chain-pullies, small tempos used for local material transportation and lifts. To identify health hazards and 
exposures to excessive noise and air pollution, we perform tests and maintain certifications such as Noise, Lux, and 
water testing. Incident investigations are carried out for any workplace incidents, including injuries and illnesses, with 
two dedicated first aid rooms available to provide initial medical assistance before referring individuals to the Sharda 
Medical Health Care Centre. Hazard identification and risk assessment processes are followed to identify work-
related hazards and risks, including daily plant rounds to identify unsafe acts and conditions. We also hold quarterly 
safety committee meetings with workers and conduct third-party safety audits periodically.
	
c)	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such 
risks. (Y/N)
	
	
Yes, we have established processes for workers to report work-related hazards and to avoid such risks. Our code 
of conduct empowers employees to report any incidents that adversely affect the environment, health, or safety to 
management. Additionally, workers are encouraged to discuss work-related hazards directly with their respective 
Heads of Departments (HODs) and can request corrective actions to address these concerns.
	
d)	
Do the employees/worker of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services? 
(Yes/No)
	
	
Yes, employees and workers have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services. On-site medical 
facilities are available for minor health issues and emergencies. Additionally, through the organisation’s insurance 
coverage (such as Group Insurance and ESIC), employees and workers can access medical services at a network of 
hospitals nationwide.

Yes. The human resource department is responsible for addressing human rights impacts or issues caused or contributed

5.	
Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues.
	
Employees are encouraged to first address any issues or grievances with their immediate supervisor. If the concern 
is not resolved satisfactorily at this level, the employee has the option to escalate the matter further. This can involve 
bringing the issue to the attention of the Head of the Department (HOD) for additional oversight and potential resolution. 
Additionally, the employee can seek assistance from the Human Resources (HR) department, which can provide further 
support and facilitate a more comprehensive resolution process. This escalation process ensures that employees have 
multiple avenues to seek redress and ensures that their concerns are addressed in a structured and supportive manner.
