reporting, the collection and compilation of information and the making of appropriate assumptions or, where appropriate, 
the making of appropriate estimates. Furthermore, the legal representatives are responsible for necessary internal controls to 
enable the preparation of a sustainability report that is free of material - intentional or unintentional - erroneous information.
VERIFICATION METHODOLOGY AND PROCEDURES PERFORMED
The verification engagement has been planned and performed in accordance with the verification methodology developed 
by the TÜV SÜD Group which is based upon the ISO 17029 and ISAE 3000. The applied level of assurance was “limited 
assurance”. Because the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance, the engagement is lower than in a reasonable as- 
surance engagement, the procedures the verification team performs in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and 
timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. A limited assurance engagement consists of 
making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for the preparation of the Sustainability Report and applying analytical and 
other limited assurance procedures.
The verification was based on a systematic and evidence-based assurance process limited as stated above. The selection of 
assurance procedures is subject to the auditor’s own judgment.

GHG Emissions
Risk
The expansion of 
manufacturing capacity 
to meet rising demand 
could potentially 
lead to an increase 
in greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions.
We are dedicated to significantly reducing 
our GHG emissions by implementing cutting-
edge energy and water-efficient technologies, 
transitioning to renewable energy sources 
such as onsite solar projects, and procuring 
renewable energy through power purchase 
agreements (PPAs). Additionally, we are 
increasing 
our 
biofuel 
consumption, 
optimizing our network, switching to cleaner 
fuel alternatives in transportation, and phasing 
out coal usage in operations. Our key actions 
to address climate change include:
z
z
Achieving Net-Zero emissions by FY 2045.
z
z
Committing to near-term and Net-Zero 
Science-based targets.
z
z
Successfully eliminating coal from our 
operations by FY 2023-24.
z
z
Ensuring over 60% of our energy 
consumption comes from renewable 
sources by FY 2026.
Negative – While adopting new and 
efficient technologies will require significant 
financial investments and ongoing technical 
skill training, these measures will ultimately 
lead to cost savings, improved efficiency, 
and enhanced corporate reputation in the 
long term.

Packaging & 
Waste 
Risk 
Dabur faces significant 
risks related to 
packaging and waste 
management due to 
the extensive use of 
plastic, paper, metal, 
and glass in our 
products. Ineffective 
waste management and 
non-compliance with 
Extended Producer 
Responsibility (EPR) 
regulations could 
result in severe 
environmental, 
regulatory, and 
reputational 
consequences.
To address these risks, Dabur has implemented 
a comprehensive waste management strategy 
that treats waste as a valuable resource and 
strengthens circularity. Key initiatives include:
z
z
Plastic Waste Positive Achievement: 
By becoming a plastic waste positive 
company and maintaining this status 
annually, we ensure that the amount of 
plastic waste collected, recycled, sent 
to waste-to-energy recovery, and safely 
disposed of exceeds the amount of plastic 
packaging we utilize.
z
z
Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle (3R) 
Principle: We rigorously adhere to the 
3R principle, continuously minimizing 
waste through strategic initiatives and 
packaging innovation aimed at reducing, 
reusing, and recycling our packaging 
materials.
z
z
Collaboration for Effective Waste 
Management: Partnering with various 
agencies and NGOs, we have established 
robust systems for the mass collection, 
processing, and disposal of waste. 
Authorized waste processors manage 
our waste, ensuring compliance with 
regulatory standards.
z
z
Organic Waste Management: We 
convert food waste into organic manure, 
diverting it from landfills and supporting 
sustainable agricultural practices.
Negative- Implementing these initiatives 
involves 
significant 
increase 
in 
costs 
associated 
with 
packaging 
innovation, 
designing, 
developing, 
and 
sourcing 
sustainable packaging alternatives, along 
with the risk of fines and penalties for non-
compliance with statutory EPR regulations. 
However, these investments and initiatives 
will yield substantial long-term financial 
benefits 
by 
reducing 
plastic 
usage, 
incorporating 
recycled 
materials, 
and 
advancing alternative packaging solutions. 
The reduced environmental footprint and 
enhanced brand reputation will align us with 
global sustainability standards, attracting 
environmentally conscious consumers and 
investors.

Innovative Packaging Solutions: We are 
investing in the design and development of 
alternative packaging materials to reduce 
reliance on virgin and non-recyclable 
materials. Our goals include:
a)	 Achieving 
30%, 
10%, 
and 
5% 
recycled plastic content in Category I, 
Category II, and Category III plastics, 
respectively, by FY 2026.
b)	 Ensuring all packaging is recyclable,

Water Scarcity 
Risk
According to the 
IPCC, water will be 
the primary way 
people experience 
climate change. Rising 
water scarcity can 
significantly disrupt 
Dabur’s operations 
and business. Erratic 
weather conditions 
such as -uncertainty in 
the timing and severity 
of summer, winter, and 
monsoon may impact 
the business adversely.
To address the risks posed by rising water 
scarcity/stress, 
Dabur 
has 
implemented 
a robust water risk management strategy 
through 
following 
water 
conservation 
measures:
Rainwater 
Harvesting 
& 
Recharge: 
We are investing in rainwater harvesting 
and recharge structures to capture and 
utilize rainwater within our operating sites 
and in nearby communities. This initiative 
significantly 
reduces 
our 
reliance 
on 
external freshwater sources while enhancing 
groundwater recharge. 
Wastewater Recycle and Reuse: All 
manufacturing locations are equipped with 
advanced wastewater treatment systems such 
as sewage treatment plants (STP) and effluent 
treatment plants (ETP). Treated waste water is 
repurposed for various uses, reducing our 
dependence on freshwater sources.
Negative – Water scarcity/stress has a 
negative implication on raw material sourcing 
and operations, leading to adverse financial 
impacts on our business.
In addition to the above, in the short term, 
implementing 
these 
initiatives 
requires 
investments in water efficient and monitoring 
technologies, waste water treatment systems, 
rainwater 
harvesting 
infrastructure, 
and 
community-led programs.
Long-term Benefits: These investments will 
yield substantial long-term financial benefits by 
reducing operational costs for water procurement 
and treatment. Improved water resilience will 
minimize business disruptions from water scarcity 
risks. Enhanced sustainability practices will boost 
our brand reputation, attracting environmentally 
and socially conscious consumers and investors. 
Effective water management ensures business 
continuity, regulatory compliance, and potentially 
avoids fines and penalties.

Commitment to Water Positivity: We aim 
to be Water Positive by FY 2030, meaning we 
will replenish more water than we consume 
through various conservation and community 
projects.
Expanded Water Monitoring: In addition 
to manufacturing sites, we monitor water 
usage at non-production sites, including 
offices, warehouses, and nurseries, to identify 
and address water usage inefficiencies 
and minimise the losses throughout our 
operations.
Community Engagement and Capacity 
Building: 
We 
collaborate 
with 
local 
communities to promote water conservation 
practices and support initiatives that enhance 
local water resources and resilience against 
water scarcity.
Raw Material 
Sourcing
Risk
Climate-related 
challenges such as 
heatwaves, droughts, 
and water stress can 
significantly impact the 
availability and quality 
of our essential raw 
materials by causing 
lower yields and 
greater yield variability. 
Since raw materials 
are very critical to the 
kind of products we 
manufacture and are
z
z
We leverage our cutting-edge Research 
and Development to identify alternative 
raw 
materials 
whenever 
specific 
ones 
are 
unavailable. 
Additionally, 
our 
procurement 
team 
strategically 
reduces reliance on single suppliers by 
developing a network of multiple vendors 
across diverse geographies, ensuring a 
consistent supply of raw materials at all 
times. Our Biodiversity team collaborates 
closely with farmers and local communities 
to cultivate critically endangered herbs, 
guaranteeing their availability both now 
and in the future.
Positive – Our strategic long-term resource 
planning, combined with the dedicated 
efforts of our procurement and biodiversity 
teams, provides us with a significant 
competitive edge.

sourced from specific 
geographies, these 
changing climatic 
conditions pose a 
substantial risk to our 
raw materials and 
their availability. This 
risk can disrupt our 
production processes 
and have a profound 
impact on our overall 
business operations.

opportunity to 
optimize energy 
efficiency through 
robust processes and 
meticulously designed 
systems, demonstrating 
an unwavering 
commitment to 
enhancing our energy-
saving initiatives.

efficient technologies and embracing green 
energy, Dabur can significantly enhance its 
triple bottom line—benefiting People, Planet, 
and Profit. This strategic focus on energy 
management not only reduces operational 
costs but also strengthens our sustainability 
credentials, 
attracting 
environmentally 
conscious stakeholders.

from sourcing to point of sale. Any cost we 
incur to conduct the Life Cycle Assessment 
will yield positive results for us in the long 
run.
Climate change 
Risk
Climate Change can 
have adverse impact 
on our business and 
not having a correct 
strategy or its right 
implementation will 
severely affect the 
business continuity.
Having a specific, measurable and smart 
approach towards climate change shall 
ensure the long-term sustainability of our 
business. We have set out specific goals and 
targets to tackle climate change.
Negative – Investing in measures to mitigate 
the impact of climate change can impose 
substantial costs on the company.

Opportunity
Our business thrives 
and flourishes due to 
the rich biodiversity 
access we have. Dabur 
has been able to utilize 
this for creating the 
best blend of science 
and ayurveda.
We will continue fostering and bettering 
the biodiversity reserves from the regions 
wherein we operate.
Positive – Any cost we incur for the 
prevention and protection of the biodiversity 
will yield positive results for our business.

norms can lead to 
adverse financial 
and reputational 
implications.
We have a grievance redressal system 
and due diligence process in place to 
continuously evaluate and promptly address 
human rights issues. This approach enhances 
our responsiveness and ability to handle such 
matters timely and effectively.
Negative – Any human rights violation or 
non-compliance of statutory norms can lead

revenue during the FY 2023-24.
The LCA, conducted in accordance with ISO 14040/44 standards by an accredited external partner, serves as a pivotal tool 
in identifying opportunities to minimize the environmental footprint of our products across their entire life cycle. From the 
procurement of raw materials to manufacturing, distribution, consumer use, and safe disposal, we are committed to ensuring 
sustainability at every stage of our products’ journey.
This initiative aligns with our commitment to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) to achieve Net Zero Emissions. By 
conducting LCAs, we take proactive steps towards meeting our Net Zero targets, allowing us to analyse and address the key 
challenges involved in reducing emissions associated with our power brands, from sourcing to point of sale.

Dabur employs a systematic approach to identify and engage with key stakeholders, aiming to strengthen relationships 
and enhance mutual understanding. The process involves assessing and identifying individuals, groups, or institutions 
that contribute value to the corporation’s business chain as core stakeholders. This includes both internal stakeholders 
such as employees and leadership, and external stakeholders such as business associates, shareholders, investors, 
customers, suppliers, and the wider community. We prioritize open, honest, and transparent communication with 
stakeholders. 
Dabur conducts comprehensive materiality assessments, which include stakeholder engagement activities. These engagements

Leadership Indicators
1.	 Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and 
social topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board. 
We have conducted a comprehensive stakeholder engagement and materiality assessment exercise with the assistance of 
an external consultant in t FY 2021-22 and this will be undertaken every 3 years. This exercise involves gathering feedback 
and input from all groups of stakeholders to determine what aspects are significant to the business. The identified gaps and 
observations from this extensive evaluation process are then communicated to senior management to prompt appropriate 
remedial actions. Updates on these actions are then channelled to the Board of Directors through different committees, 
including CSR, ESG, and Risk Management committee. The committee meetings serve as platforms for discussing and 
addressing economic, environmental, and social topics, ensuring that the Board remains informed and engaged in key 
strategic areas. 
ESG Committee plays a vital role in assisting the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities across environmental, 
health and safety, sustainability, diversity, equity and inclusion, community issues, and corporate governance realms. By 
addressing these critical areas, the ESG Committee helps uphold Dabur’s commitment towards responsible and sustainable 
business practices.
Furthermore, senior management communicates any necessary changes and corporate social responsibility CSR 
activities and social initiatives during CSR Committee meetings, aligning with program objectives, challenges, and input 
received from stakeholder interactions. This ensures that our CSR efforts effectively address stakeholder expectations 
and societal needs.
2.	 a.	 Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, 
and social topics? (Yes / No). 
Yes. In our most recent materiality assessment, which was conducted in FY 2021-22, we ensured that a wide 
spectrum of sustainability issues was incorporated into the risks and opportunities considered across the company. 
The assessment was undertaken by an independent third party to ensure complete confidentiality and impartiality. 
Our assessment identifies 19 material issues which were subsequently grouped into 15 thematic material areas. 
Detailed material issues have been provided in the stakeholder engagement section and materiality section of our 
Annual Report and Page 15 to 22 of the BRSR.
b.	 If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these topics were 
incorporated into policies and activities of the entity. 
Stakeholder input received on the material topics has been integrated into Dabur’s policies and activities. These 
inputs have guided us in making strategic decisions that prioritize sustainability, accountability, and stakeholder 
engagement. Dabur has articulated a comprehensive commitment across key focus areas such as Climate Change 
& Biodiversity, Circular Economy, Sustainable Sourcing, Energy and Water, Social impact, and Corporate 
Governance. These commitment serves as a guiding framework to empower value chain partners in building 
resilient and sustainable business ventures. Furthermore, Dabur will incorporate people and planet-positive goals 
into its talent management and stakeholder engagement strategies, fostering an ESG-centric culture within its 
business ecosystem. 
3.	 Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/ 
marginalized stakeholder groups. 
Dabur has implemented several initiatives to engage with and address the concerns of vulnerable and marginalized 
stakeholder groups. Our approach involves having development executives stationed at various plant locations, 
supported by local volunteers, to ensure direct engagement with these communities. Additionally, unit heads and unit 
HR heads in other locations work closely with communities, facilitating daily interactions to promptly address queries 
and concerns.
Regular meetings with vulnerable and marginalized groups are conducted to gain insights into their needs, allowing us to 
tailor development programs accordingly. Through these engagements, specific concerns have been identified, leading to 
the development and rollout of targeted interventions during the year.

1.	 Malnutrition & Healthcare: We organized health and nutrition awareness programs, provided seeds for growing 
nutritious vegetables, and conducted health, menstrual hygiene and oral hygiene camps. Special programs were 
organized for educating children about personal safety. Targeting the young kids, particularly the girl child in these 
communities, we organized special activity based and interactive programs to educate them about ‘Good Touch’ 
and ‘Bad Touch’.
2.	 Access to Sanitation: We supported households in constructing toilets to address the lack of proper sanitation 
facilities. We also conduct regular surveys and audits to identify toilets that are not maintained properly. The 
households are then educated about proper maintenance and even supported in revamping them, wherever 
needed.
3.	 Quality of Education: Ensuring an intellectually stimulating and transformative learning atmosphere, extending 
beyond the scope of basic education, one of the biggest aspirations of the vulnerable community. To address this 
need, we proactively set up 16 remedial education centers in 5 states where we provided basic education to out-of-
school children and prepared them for formal schooling. In addition, we undertook a complete revamp and facelift 
of 21 schools in 7 states in 2023-24, benefiting 4,313 students. Under this, the entire school was refurbished with 
new classrooms, toilet blocks, boundary walls, potable water facility, kitchen area and hand wash area, etc. We 
ensured that the schools were made accessible and inclusive for individuals with disabilities, while also equipping 
select schools with well-equipped science labs and computer labs.
4.	 Access to Water: Several vulnerable communities cited access to water as a key concern. To meet this need, 
we rolled out community-level water conservation initiatives in Ghaziabad (Uttar Pradesh); Pithampur (Madhya 
Pradesh) and Baddi (Himachal Pradesh) in 2023-24, which ensured that communities had access to potable 
water and water for their irrigation purposes all through the year. We have created total Water Conservation 
capacity of 208,427 KL within the community through these interventions, which marks a 355% jump over the 
previous year.
5.	 Access to Street Lights: Absence of streetlights within villages was another big concern as darkness led to 
several crimes and limited access for the villagers. Together with the communities, we installed solar streetlights 
in these villages to enhance safety and security. In all, 82 Solar Street Lights/Equipment were set up in 6 villages 
and 3 schools in 2023-24.
6.	 Enhancing Farmer Income: Understanding the needs of several low-income farmer groups and tribals in the 
country, we engaged them in cultivation of medicinal plants and herbs. We provided quality plantation material to 
these farmers free of cost and trained them in sustainable cultivation techniques, which is helping them improve 
their income.
7.	 Women Empowerment: We operate 24 skill training centers across 5 states offering local women and girls 
training on income generation vocational skills like stitching, tailoring, beauty care, etc. These trainings go on to 
establish their own small ventures and earn livelihood. In FY2023-24, 1091 girls were trained at these centers. In 
addition, 15,374 farmers - largely women - were provided beekeeping training during the year, and another 31 
women were supported to undertake livestock rearing as an income-generating activity.
8.	 Sports Training: In response to specific demands in Assam, we hired local trainers and set up training camps for 
football and boxing, promoting sports talent in the region. We have hired local trainers and set up training camps 
to help youth and kids from the villages emerge as sporting talent for our country.
These actions reflect our commitment to addressing the concerns of vulnerable and marginalized groups, promoting 
their well-being, and fostering sustainable development.

Upon receiving a disclosure of violation, the Direct Touch team investigates to verify its authenticity and veracity. In addition, 
to ensure the fairness in the grievance redressal process, we have appointed an Independent Director in the Direct Touch 
Committee. Based on the outcome of such investigation, the Direct Touch team recommends corrective action to the 
management within 30 days of the receipt of the disclosure. The management takes appropriate action immediately based

Under our Prevention of Sexual Harassment Policy, we have constituted an “Internal Complaints Committee” for redressal of 
sexual harassment complaints (made by the victim) and for ensuring time bound treatment of such complaints. The policy 
outlines clauses on Protection to Complainant / Victim, wherein the company calls out its commitment to ensuring that 
no employee who brings forward a harassment concern is subject to any form of reprisal. Any reprisal will be subject to 
disciplinary action. We also ensure that the victim or witnesses are not victimized or discriminated against while dealing with 
complaints of sexual harassment. We are dedicated, to the greatest degree feasible, to safeguarding confidentiality.
As an equal opportunity employer, we evaluate all employees solely based on their performance, irrespective of their 
race, religion, caste, gender, sexual orientation, age, or disability ensuring that there is no discrimination in recruitment, 
remuneration, promotion processes, or career development.
Additionally, our Direct Touch initiative (whistleblower & protection policy) encourages stakeholders to report any malpractices 
within the organization. This policy has constituted a Direct Touch team to investigate complaints and recommend corrective 
actions. It ensures that disclosures of wrongful conduct are kept confidential and can be submitted anonymously. Such 
disclosures are confidential to the extent possible, convenient with the need to conduct an adequate investigation. No adverse 
action shall be taken against a stakeholder in “knowing retaliation” (defined as an adverse action taken by a supervisor or 
other authority against a stakeholder because of a prior disclosure of alleged wrongful conduct), who makes any good faith 
disclosure of suspect wrongful conduct to the Direct Touch team.

Yes. To ensure our commitment towards human rights, we have executed service agreements with our vendor partners and

All our suppliers are governed by the Supplier Code of Conduct. The supplier code of conduct document calls out that the 
organization expects all its suppliers to comply with all applicable laws in terms of labour and human rights, environment 
conservation, food safety and statutory compliance for business practices in true spirit & intent. The same also lays down the 
mechanism to report any illegal or unethical business practices at workplace without fear of reprisal.

Consumption & 
Conservation
Dabur is committed to implementing water conservation measures across its 
operations and value chain. As part of its ESG commitment, Dabur not only 
monitors water data at manufacturing sites but also at non-production sites like 
offices, warehouses, nurseries, and employee dormitories. This comprehensive 
approach has enabled the identification of opportunities for improving 
sustainability throughout the value chain.
Over the past five years, Dabur has successfully reduced its water intensity by 
27% across India, despite maintaining a focus on a large beverage portfolio. 
In FY 2023-24 alone, this led to a reduction in water intensity by approximately 
9%. Moreover, Dabur is actively engaged in reducing water consumption in its 
operations and surrounding communities, working towards a water-positive future.

Energy 
Consumption & 
Conservation
Dabur has always been at the forefront of conserving energy in its operations with the 
objective of reducing consumption of non-renewable fossil fuels, improving energy 
productivity, reducing operational costs which contribute towards mitigating the 
impact of Climate Change. Efficient energy management and conservation is, in 
fact, the foundation of its strategy towards managing its environmental footprint.
Dabur has been continuously implementing energy saving measures to improve 
its energy efficiency. In last few years, Dabur has invested heavily in expanding 
its Juices portfolio, which is reflected in its business saliency moving towards 
Foods & Beverages. Manufacturing of beverages is energy and water intensive. 
Despite this, Dabur has reduced its energy intensity by 16% in the last 4 years. 
Some of the key initiatives taken this year are:
z
z
Use of Energy efficient motors and process equipment in its operations
z

Plastic Waste 
Recycling and 
Management
Dabur embarked on its EPR journey in 2016 by engaging a competent waste 
management company to conduct a comprehensive waste management study across 
all its units. This study aimed to obtain authentic data for assessing EPR liability across 
various packaging categories through qualitative and quantitative analysis.
During the year, Dabur achieved significant milestones in plastic waste 
management, with approximately 73% of post-consumer plastic waste being 
recycled, and the remaining 27% safely disposed of through methods such 
as waste-to-energy and utilization in cement industries. Notably, Dabur’s 
commitment to Plastic Positivity led to the processing of 103% of post-consumer 
plastic waste in FY 2023-24, reflecting its dedication to sustainable practices.
Moreover, Dabur actively participates in events related to plastic neutrality, 
waste management, and EPR initiatives organized by the Government of India, 
Pollution Control Board, FAME, CII, FICCI, and other industry stakeholders. As 
a thought leader in this space, Dabur contributes to shaping discussions and 
driving positive change towards a more sustainable and responsible approach 
to plastic waste management.

Environment policy, EHS procedures, emergency response plan, incident & 
near miss reporting, work permit system, workplace hazard and control, risk 
assessment and hazard identification among others. 
To enhance employee engagement and reporting of unsafe acts & unsafe 
conditions, near misses, incidents, all of which form the cornerstone of a safety 
system, we have implemented a digital app. All employees are encouraged 
to install the app and utilize it for reporting of any such incidents which has 
resulted in enhanced reporting of safety-related incidents.
Each manufacturing site of Dabur has implemented formal systems and 
processes for risk assessment. All employees are encouraged to report the 
hazards which they observe. The system supports a process for handling all 
hazards adequately and following them up to completion. The factory managers 
at each location holds the responsibility to take measures for mitigating any 
associated risks.
To facilitate a deep dive into the safety issues, 574 Safety & Environment Kaizens 
were held across different locations on themes such as machine guarding, 
electrical safety, forklift & driving safety, winter safety, PTW & PPE compliance, 
and other such related topics.
Dabur have 
been a 
Zero fatality 
organisation for 
many years now.

unique complaint number is generated and also shared with the consumer for future reference. This is followed by a detailed

Our product labels provide detailed information, including instructions for safe usage and a list of key ingredients. 
Additionally, graphical representations are used on certain products to visually illustrate proper usage. We actively engage 
with consumers on social media platforms, sharing informative content about product safety and manufacturing processes. 
Through posts and videos, we educate consumers about the natural properties of products like Honey and Juices, as well as 
proper handling techniques.
Specialized educational videos are created to address common consumer queries and concerns, such as the crystallization of 
honey. These videos are distributed through platforms like WhatsApp and social media and are also promoted through media 
channels to reach a wider audience. By employing these strategies, we aim to empower consumers with the knowledge
