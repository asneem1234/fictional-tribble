Externally, we actively collaborate with communities near our operations. Together, we enhance livelihoods, improve access to education 
and healthcare, and promote sustainable rural value chains, all contributing to shared prosperity. This collaborative spirit extends to our 
environmental efforts. We focus on circularity, resource efficiency, and minimizing our environmental footprint. Our success in achieving an 
88.8% solvent recovery rate and procuring xx% of raw materials from renewable sources exemplifies the power of collaboration in driving 
sustainability.
We are also committed to building a diverse and inclusive workplace. Through collaborative initiatives, we aim to increase women in leader-
ship positions by 25%, recognizing the positive impact diversity has on innovation and business performance.
Strong governance is another pillar of our success. We operate with integrity and transparency, upholding a robust code of conduct aligned 
with international standards. We maintain continuous engagement with stakeholders to ensure our practices meet their expectations.
Looking ahead, we are committed to a continuous improvement journey towards becoming a more sustainable and responsible company. 
We will continue to remain actively engaged with stakeholders in reviewing our practices and setting ambitious and progressive targets. A 
key example is our collaborative approach to reducing our carbon footprint. By 2025, our goal is to accomplish a 25% decrease in specific 
CO2 emissions, reduce freshwater consumption by 25%, minimize landfill waste by 25%, elevate renewable energy usage to 20%, and lower 
LTIFR to 0.20. These objectives will be pursued through collaborative endeavors, including investments in renewable energy, enhancements 
in energy efficiency, and the encouragement of sustainable practices among our employees. Collaborative efforts will also focus on reducing 
waste and maximizing the utilization of sustainable materials, thereby aligning with our core sustainability objectives. We are also collaborat-
ing with experts to enhance sustainability capacity building of the organization and teams in  key roles.
Our key achievements in the ESG space include: Increase employees’ average training hours per FTE by 87%, Increase women’s participation 
in leadership positions by 50%, 25,300+ acres brought under sustainable agricultural practices by educating farmers about climate-resilient 
agricultural practices, 70% of enrolled youth placed through skill development initiatives, Reduced landfill waste by 14% from base year, 
Increased share of renewable usage in total electricity mix to 5.35 percent.
To cultivate a collaborative ESG culture and engage our employees towards sustainability efforts, we have commenced a comprehensive 
communication initiative. We communicate our sustainability goals, progress and inspire employees to take actions to reduce environmental 
impact and uphold collective and individual social responsibility.  Through these collaborative efforts, PI Industries reaffirms its commitment 
and is poised to drive positive and lasting impact on society and environment and, creating shared value for all stakeholders.

and regulations.
	
•	
Packaging: Ongoing initiatives on the packaging of both raw materials and finished products are being taken. Procurement of raw 
materials in bulk, tankers or jumbo bags is encouraged to reduce the handling of various types of packaging materials. The same leads 
to adherence to environmental and safety standards and helps in better utilization of container space resulting in a lower number of 
trips. Through our concentrated efforts, we continue to modify the packaging of our finished products to reduce the use of plastics 
and switch to recycled paper instead.
	
•	
Standardization of Packaging: Our new packaging is tamper-proof and adopts a customer-friendly design architecture.
	
•	
Product Stewardship: We have introduced processes to strengthen product stewardship reviews by ensuring the involvement of 
technical experts from key departments such as operations and supply chain.
	
•	
Material Handling: We are sourcing bulk products and storing them in tankers/ISO tankers instead of drums. The same has resulted in 
reduced drum handling and ensured adherence to key environmental and safety standards.
	
The company has engaged in dialogue with value chain partners regarding sustainable sourcing. The company is establishing guidelines 
to screen and assess suppliers, policies, implementing goal-setting and periodic reviews to ensure continuous improvement in the rate of 
sustainable sourcing. Further, the company is also working on developing criteria for the assessment of its suppliers.

Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity.
We recognize the significance of stakeholder engagement and value the inputs and perspectives of our stakeholders in shaping our business 
strategies and practices. We have established a robust process for identifying key stakeholder groups which involve the following steps:
Stakeholder Mapping: We conduct a thorough analysis to identify and categorize our stakeholders based on their level of influence and 
impact on our business. This mapping exercise helps us identify both internal and external stakeholders, including employees, customers, 
suppliers, investors, regulatory bodies, local communities, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and industry associations.
Dialogue and Feedback: At the heart of our corporate ethos lies a commitment to cultivating transparent and inclusive communication 
avenues with our stakeholders. Through an array of channels including surveys, focus groups, town hall meetings, and consultations, we 
actively foster dialogue. These engagements serve as invaluable platforms for comprehending the diverse concerns, expectations, and 
aspirations of our stakeholders regarding our operations, products, and sustainability initiatives.
Materiality Assessment: To prioritize our stakeholder engagement efforts, we conducted a comprehensive materiality assessment in FY 
22-23. This involved evaluating the significance of various issues raised by stakeholders based on their potential impact on our business 
and the broader social, environmental, and economic context. The materiality assessment helps us identify key areas where stakeholder 
expectations align with our business strategy and sustainability goals.
Continuous Monitoring: Over time stakeholder dynamics evolve, and it becomes essential for us to stay updated on their changing needs 
and expectations. We regularly monitor industry trends, conduct periodic reviews of stakeholder concerns and feedback, and stay informed 
about emerging social, environmental, and regulatory developments. This helps us adapt our stakeholder engagement processes and 
strategies to ensure ongoing relevance and effectiveness.
Collaboration and Partnerships: We actively seek opportunities for collaboration and partnerships with our stakeholders. By engaging in 
multi-stakeholder initiatives, industry associations, and platforms focused on sustainable development, we foster dialogue, share best 
practices, and collaborate on addressing shared challenges. These collaborations enable us to gain insights, build trust, and co-create 
innovative solutions that benefit both our business and our stakeholders. This year we have focused on strategic collaboration on issues 
that align with our long term business strategy.

Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues.
Vigilance Mechanism: Our company has established a robust mechanism for reporting compliance violations. A “vigil mechanism” is 
published on the company’s website, enabling individuals to file complaints, even anonymously if desired.
Monthly Meetings: Regular regional, territory, and zonal manager meetings with HR Business Partners serve as a platform to cultivate a 
positive work environment, fostering trust and mutual respect between employees and management.
Grievance Management Portal: Additionally, we have implemented a Grievance Management portal to monitor the status of grievances 
filed by employees. We intend to expand the usage of this portal to other functional areas in the future.

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases.
The Company has instituted a thorough process for receiving and addressing concerns and grievances pertaining to instances of 
discrimination and harassment. Within the framework of the POSH Policy, a dedicated section is designated to safeguard the confidentiality 
of the complainant’s identity, ensuring all matters are handled with utmost discretion. Similarly, under the Whistleblower Policy, significant 
emphasis is placed on preserving the anonymity of whistleblowers and preventing any form of reprisal for reporting protected disclosures.
Complementing these policies, the Company’s Code of Conduct and Human Rights Commitment policy underscore the imperative of 
treating each complaint with fairness and impartiality. Retaliation against individuals voicing legitimate concerns is strictly forbidden, with 
disciplinary measures imposed on any implicated parties. Regular training sessions on the Company’s code of conduct are conducted to 
promote exemplary workplace practices.
Employees are encouraged to engage in open dialogue with their line managers or HR representatives regarding instances of discrimination 
or harassment, without apprehension of retaliation. The Company’s policies prioritize the comprehensive protection of complainants and 
mandate the handling of all such matters with strict confidentiality. Furthermore, the Policy for Prevention of Sexual Harassment ensures 
the confidentiality of complaints is rigorously maintained.

*Water withdrawn is estimated based on the document by the Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA), which specifies that an office employee consumes 45 
litres per day per head. This amount is recorded as water withdrawn from third party source. Further the untreated water discharged is considered as 80% of 
the water withdrawn from source based on Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) database report dated December 24, 2009. Therefore, it is assumed that of 
the total water withdrawal, only 20% is consumed for certain locations.

10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your company to 
reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
At PI, we manage waste scientifically by segregation at source as per waste’s characteristics. The waste management philosophy of PI 
Industries is to reduce the amount of waste generated and effectively manage the waste generated. 
Low COD/Lows TDS wastewater is treated in Effluent Treatment Plant while High COD/High TDS wastewater is treated in in-house Multiple 
Effect Evaporator (MEE) first or disposed off  through Common approved MEE facilities outside as per Regulatory authorization. Incinerable 
waste (solid and liquid) is sent for disposal to common incinerator facilities (TSDF) and to cement industries for co processing or preprocessing 
facilities. MEE salt coming from inhouse MEE being disposed off as per regulatory authorization.
In line with the principles of Responsible Care, use of hazardous and toxic chemicals in products is discouraged. At PI, we believe “what gets 
measured gets managed”. A ‘Product Lifecycle Approach’ to assess impacts of products across all stages of development has been adopted. 
At R&D stage, waste generation-based E-factor calculation has been adopted which help us not only to measure the total waste generated 
from each stage of product but also STRIVE projects to reduce E- factor through Green chemistry approach.

Outcome of the initiative
1
Purchase of Hybrid power 
At our 02 manufacturing sites located in Panoli GIDC 
area, Gujarat, we have initiated the purchase of hybrid 
power to Increase the renewable energy mix in total 
electricity consumption
This initiative will enable us 
to procure 12605298 KWh of 
renewable power thus reducing 
reduce 8950 MT of CO2 yearly
2
Fuel switch i.e. Liquefied 
nitrogen gas (LNG) instead of 
Furnace oil /LDO in boiler
For steam generation in Boiler at one of our manufactur-
ing facility located at Jambusar the conventional fuel (FO/
LDO) has been replaced with a cleaner alternative  (LNG) 
This initiative  help to reduce 
consumption of 18603918 Kg of 
FO/LDO which will save 18832 
MT of CO2 yearly
3
Installation of 650 KLD capac-
ity RO plant at Jambusar site
To reduce freshwater consumption at one of our manu-
facturing facilities located in Jambusar , we have installed 
Reverse Osmosis (RO) plant with a capacity of 650 KLD
At current load and efficiency, 
the project will recycle the 
treated water which will help to 
reduce freshwater consumption 
approximately by 185 ML per 
year.

Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan? Give details in 100 words/ web link.
Certainly, an emergency plan is firmly in place for all manufacturing sites. Our Emergency Response plan meticulously categorizes events 
into three distinct classifications: crisis, emergency, and incidents. In every scenario, the primary protocol prioritizes the safety of individuals 
present at the site, achieved through either prompt evacuation or assembly at designated points, accompanied by provisions for medical 
assistance including first aid and emergency medical services.
The layout of our facilities is deliberately designed to ensure that all Manufacturing Production Processes (MPPs) and other departments 
have unhindered access to escape routes and assembly points.
Furthermore, the plan meticulously delineates the responsible parties for each action item, ensuring clear accountability. In the event of an 
unforeseen circumstance beyond control, our emergency escalation matrix provides a defined course of action.
Additionally, we conduct regular rehearsal drills and exercises to assess our preparedness, with outcomes meticulously documented and 
integrated into the plan for continual improvement.
