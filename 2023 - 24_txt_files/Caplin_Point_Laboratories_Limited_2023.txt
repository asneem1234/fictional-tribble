(Indicate Positive or

1
Developing a pipeline 
of talented workforce
Opportunity
Inability to meet employees’ 
skill upgradation, career growth 
and welfare expectations would 
result 
in 
higher 
employee 
turnover. This is particularly 
so since the manufacturing 
and R&D operations of the 
Company are located in areas 
where 
strong 
competition 
exists 
for 
relevant 
skilled 
manpower. 
Hence, the Company considers 
nurturing internal talent by 
way of upskilling the present 
employees and creating an 
active talent pool by partnering 
with educational institutions 
as the two key initiatives in 
developing a talented and 
robust work force.
--
Positive.
Upskilling the workforce will 
scale up the knowledge and 
awareness 
towards 
good 
manufacturing and business 
practices 
which 
ensures 
compliance with all applicable 
norms and increases quality 
consciousness.
Creating a talent pool which 
can be readily absorbed into 
operations will empower those 
who are entering the industry 
fresh after their education. 
It will also ensure that the 
company’s operations do not 
suffer due to lack of adequate 
talented manpower.
2
Promoting Diversity 
 Opportunity The company recognises the 
importance 
of 
workplace 
diversity 
in 
promoting 
organisational resilience and 
having a committed workforce. 
The Company also recognises 
the importance of empowering 
people from varied social and 
economic background as well 
as enhancing gender diversity.
--
Positive.
Promoting 
organisational 
resilience will enable the 
company 
to 
successfully 
navigate adverse events or 
circumstances.

Company’s business growth

requires 
increasing 
acceptance of the Company’s

in particular the community 
at large where the Company

Risk of Non

 Risk 
Pharmaceutical manufacturing 
processes falls under the ambit 
of Hazardous processes which 
requires 
strict 
compliances

caused due to any deviance.
The 
Company 
implements 
measures 
to 
both 
adapt 
and 
mitigate 
risks 
arising 
due 
to 
evolving 
Compliance 
requirements.
Adapting is done by evaluating 
the specific actions to be taken by 
the Company to comply with the 
requirements including change in 
business processes, upgrading/ 
modifying operating procedures 
to meet compliance requirements 
and evaluating Compliance risks 
as part of the Risk Management 
process of the Company.

Non-compliance may have 
detrimental 
effects,

as financial loss and loss of

Financial implications of

(Indicate Positive or

Mitigating involves a strategy of

utilising technology for managing 
and 
reporting 
compliances, 
obtaining 
assurance 
of 
compliance 
through 
internal 
sources like internal compliance 
audits/ verifications and external

Internal 
Audit 
verifications, drawing down an 
action plan for remedying non-

and 
escalating 
significant instances of non- 
compliances to appropriate levels 
for remedial action.
5
Risk of engagement 
with such value 
chain partners who 
do not share the 
vision of sustainable 
development and 
environmental goals
Risk
Due to the nature of business, 
Company needs to engage 
with diverse range of value 
chain partners. To ensure that 
those who form the part of the 
value chain are in line with 
the manufacturing standards, 
environmental 
goals 
and 
sustainability objectives of the 
company is a complex task. 
But, the risk of deviation in 
any part of the value chain will 
have significant impact on both 
the sustainability and business 
performance of the Company.
The Company follows a strategy 
of contractually enforcing key 
sustainability 
goals 
through 
its sourcing contracts with the 
value chain partners and also by 
way of reference to the code of 
business ethics in the purchase 
orders issued to vendors. The 
Company is also subject to 
similar covenants in contracts 
with its Customers in regulated 
markets which specify explicit 
measures to be taken to comply 
with the environmental goals 
and 
sustainability 
objectives. 
These covenants are tracked for 
performance to avoid breach.
Negative.
Risk of violation by value 
chain partners will have both 
sustainability and business 
impact. Breach of contractual 
terms with customers may 
lead to claims.

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets and achievements:
The Company is dedicated to conducting its operations and business affairs honestly, morally, and in compliance with all applicable laws and 
ethical principles. However, the Company is also well aware that ESG is not just about meeting the ethical standards and ensuring compliances 
but also about how we incorporate sustainability and social responsibility in to our strategy and decision making process so that the steps we take 
considers the holistic benefits to all the stakeholders.
Towards this, the Company will take further steps to strengthen ESG integration into its decision making process and we will also take steps to 
measure the impact of ESG initiatives for interventions wherever required.
As elsewhere specified in the report, the main challenge remains how we will also bring in the value chain partners into this ESG journey on which 
we had embarked upon. This will be addressed by a multi-pronged strategy like extending the Code of Conduct and Business Ethics, Whistle Blower 
mechanism etc. to value chain partners, imposing ESG obligations through contractual clauses etc.

5.	 Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its coverage and implementation.
Despite not having a ZLD mechanism the Company’s water management and treatment practices are meticulously organized across its various units, each 
employing tailored strategies to ensure efficient treatment and reuse of water, thus minimizing environmental impact and supporting sustainability goals.
Amaris (CRO)
Source and Collection: Trade effluent from the bio-analytical laboratory is collected in a designated solvent waste storage area. This area is routinely 
inspected to ensure safety and compliance.
Primary Treatment: Involves the removal of suspended solids and organic matter, followed by chemical treatment where lime is used for pH control. 
Chemical coagulants (Alum) and flocculants (polyelectrolytes) are added to facilitate the aggregation and settling of fine particles.
Secondary Treatment: The treated effluent undergoes solar evaporation using concrete solar beds, effectively reducing liquid waste through natural processes.
CPL R&D (Ticel Bio-Park)
The unit operates a common treatment plant, which includes a 2 KLD Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) and a 20 KLD Sewage Treatment Plant (STP).
ETP Process: The effluent undergoes collection, flocculation, primary and secondary settling, followed by biological treatment in an aeration tank. 
Post-treatment, the water is filtered through pressure sand and activated carbon filters.
STP Process: Sewage is collected, aerated, and settled through a Fluidised Bio Reactor system. The treated sewage is filtered, disinfected, and then 
reused for gardening, floor washing, and toilet flushing. The bio sludge generated is repurposed as manure.
CPL R&D (Hyderabad)
The unit is equipped with 10 KL tanks specifically for storing liquid waste. Pre-treatment processes are not conducted here; instead, once the 
tanks are full, the effluent’s pH is tested, and adjustments are made if necessary before contacting the agency collecting/treating the effluents. 
Wastewater Management: Domestic wastewater from the facility is discharged directly into drains after pH adjustment, ensuring the effluent 
complies with regulatory pH ranges.
Head Office, CPL R&D, CSL R&D – (Perungudi)
Like the Ticel Bio-Park, this location also utilizes a 2 KLD Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) and a 20 KLD Sewage Treatment Plant (STP).
ETP Process: The effluent is treated through collection, flocculation, settling, biological treatment, and filtration, with treated water being reused for 
gardening and flushing.
STP Process: The Fluidised Bio Reactor system treats sewage by aerating and settling it, followed by filtration and disinfection. The treated water is 
reused for non-potable purposes, and the bio sludge is used as manure.
CSL Manufacturing Unit (Gummidipoondi)
This unit employs a multi-stage Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) that includes primary (chemical), secondary (biological), and tertiary (filtration and 
disinfection) treatment processes. Sewage Treatment: The facility’s Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) also follows a biological treatment process. 
Reuse of Treated Water: The final treated effluent consistently meets Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) standards and is reused for 
gardening, helping to conserve water and enhance greenery within the facility.

ETP Mechanisms -The effluent from various production processes (e.g., OSD, suppositories, liquid orals) is collected in a 130 KL influent storage 
sump. It undergoes flocculation and pH stabilization, primary settling, bioreactor treatment, secondary settling, and final clarification and filtration. 
The treated water is then passed through a Reverse Osmosis (RO) system, with the permeate being used for utility purposes.
STP Mechanisms- Domestic effluent is screened, aerated, and settled before undergoing multiple filtration stages. The treated sewage is stored 
and repurposed for gardening, thus minimizing the discharge of untreated wastewater into the environment.

9.	 Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details.
Yes. The company has implemented a series of energy-saving initiatives aimed at reducing its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and enhancing 
sustainability. The introduction of solid fuel fired boilers, specifically 6 Ton and 3 Ton capacity briquettes fired boilers which are renewable and 
carbon-neutral energy source, not only saves ` 15 lakhs per month but also significantly reduces the carbon footprint.
The installation of water-cooled chillers, including an 800 Ton centrifugal and a 400 Ton screw type chiller, replaces the less efficient 185 Ton 
air-cooled chillers. This transition results in annual cost savings of ` 294.1 lakhs and energy savings of 3,676,320 kW, thereby lowering electricity 
consumption and associated GHG emissions. Furthermore, the reuse of 75 KL/day of reject water from the RO plant for cooling tower condensation 
and boiler feed water reduces the environmental impact of effluent disposal and conserves water.
Additionally, the decommissioning of 40 TR air-cooled chillers and re-connection to 800 TR water-cooled chillers saves ` 22.1 lakhs annually and 
276,480 kW of energy per annum, further reducing GHG emissions. The introduction of the Nitrogen Micro Bulk Cylinder (MBC) system optimizes 
the nitrogen supply process, saving ` 3.35 lakhs monthly and reducing logistical emissions.
Together, these initiatives showcase the company’s commitment to sustainability and its proactive approach to reducing GHG emissions through 
efficient energy use, water conservation, and optimized processes.

11.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your company to reduce 
usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
The company implements a comprehensive waste management strategy across all its units to ensure that hazardous waste is handled, stored, and 
disposed of in an environmentally responsible manner, in compliance with relevant regulations. A standardized procedure for managing both liquid 
and solid waste has been established, which includes proper waste segregation according to standard guidelines. The company has successfully 
diverted most of the waste generated at its facilities to authorized recyclers and vendors, ensuring that both hazardous and non-hazardous waste 
is managed efficiently. Hazardous waste, such as spent solvents, is provided to authorized recyclers; chemical solid waste and spent oil are sent 
to recycling facilities; used batteries are returned to manufacturers on a buy-back basis; e-waste is sent to recyclers or returned to manufacturers; 
and biomedical waste is sent to authorized recyclers. For non-hazardous waste, paper waste is sent to authorized vendors for recycling, and plastic 
waste is sent to recyclers. In FY23-24, the company is initiating the disposal of hazardous waste at an Alternate Fuel Resource Facility (AFRF) to 
reduce landfill use and incineration, thus minimizing land contamination and air pollution. In AFRF, hazardous waste is pre-processed and then 
used as fuel in cement factories, further enhancing the company’s commitment to sustainable waste management.
