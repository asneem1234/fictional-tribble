National Green Tribunal (NGT) on its own motion took cognizance of the matter of alleged pollution by six industries in 
North Chennai based on news item published. NGT recommended to create a corpus fund which shall consist of deposit 
of minimum 01% of the annual turnover from all the Companies located in the Manali industrial area for the restoration of 
any affected area after the order passed by the Tribunal. CPCL and other industries challenged the said recommendation 
before the Hon’ble  High Court of Madras on August 17, 2023. The Hon’ble of High Court vide its order dtd.  March 14, 
2024 quashed the order passed by the NGT on the ground of violation of principles of Natural Justice and hence arbitrary 
& unjust. 
	
In another matter, NGT on its own motion initiated proceeding regarding Oil leakage in Nagapattinam district based on the 
news item published. Albeit, report of all the Institutions including Joint  Committee reported of no adverse environmental 
impact stating that the oil leakage was only due to external impact and hence no  remedial measures is recommended, 
the NGT however levied a no-fault liability of ₹ 5 cr to be utilized for environment improvement and health of local 
people.
	
NGT in another matter, with respect to flooding caused by Michaung Cyclone, while issuing notice to Govt. of Tamil 
Nadu and TNPCB, also made CPCL a party. Based on the direction of the NGT, CPCL along with Govt. of TN has taken 
adequate measures for cleaning and rehabilitation of the affected areas. The matter is pending for further hearing.
