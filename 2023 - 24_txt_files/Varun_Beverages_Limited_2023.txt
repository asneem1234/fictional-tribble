Life Cycle Assessment Process
VBL is working continuously on screening our end-to-end production processes to deliver positive impact on 
environment. In alignment to this, we adopted Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and undertook an internal study to 
assess the environmental impacts and embed the principles of sustainability into various stages of product i.e, 
procurement of raw material, manufacturing of products, transportation of raw materials and supply of finished 
goods. In order to continuously reduce the environmental footprint, the Company is improving efficiencies, 
especially on critical resources such as water, fuel and energy, optimizing the resource consumption and 
minimizing wastages including plastic waste management, increasing green cover in manufacturing plants and 
also developing outside establishments.

and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.	
	
	
We do segregation of all type of waste at source and store wastes in designated areas only. Wastages are closely 
monitored on daily, weekly and monthly basis and are directly linked with plant KPIs. Approximately more than 90-98% 
waste (broken glass, plastic bottles, cartons, metal waste etc) goes for recycling. Unit has effective ETP operation 
combined with aeration and anaerobic system wherein effective operational controls ensures very limited quantity of 
ETP sludge generation as a hazardous waste. ETP sludge is safely collected in Hazardous waste storage area and finally 
disposal is done to pollution control board approved TSDF facility for landfill. Unit is not using any toxic chemicals.

VBL Consumer response programme is developed to promptly resolve consumer concerns & grievances, which 
ensures that consumer/customer is responded with courtesy and in timely manner. The Mechanism helps the 
organization to remain consumer centric, establish top down approach to build trust and strengthen transparency 
while addressing their queries and concerns:
	
The Complaints are lodged by consumer (via Toll Free no. available on label & crown), arranged and sorted by the 
PepsiCo Consumer Response System (CRS) representative who then, forwards the same to VBL after logging in 
on Wilke portal. VBL Plant team & Consumer Care/Complaint Management System (CCMS) coordinator review 
auto generated email containing relevant details of the Complaint which are then investigated by VBL Plant team, 
Regional Quality Coordinator (RQC) & CCMS coordinator and the complaint is attended by Customer Relationship 
Executive (CRE) to address the concern simultaneously. After detailed analysis of each reported complaints by all 
the plants root cause analysis is carried out and Corrective and Preventive Actions are taken by plant team.
	
Plants then, initiate an improvement plan to mitigate reoccurrence of concern and to pacify & satisfy the 
consumer.

Feedback is sent to PepsiCo CRS team by CCMS coordinator and Pepsi International (PI) Team connects & 
respond to consumer, subsequently on SOS basis.
