toward sexual harassment and discrimination, ensuring that any instances of such misconduct are met with severe

prohibiting, and punishing acts of sexual harassment. This strategy also focuses on educating employees and workers 
about behaviours that constitute harassment, promoting awareness and understanding throughout the organization.

ensuring they do not face any adverse consequences for their actions.

 Yes, human rights requirements form an integral part of the Companyos business agreements and contracts. It incorporates 
its Supplier Code of Conduct (SCoC) into all business agreements, purchase orders, and contracts with suppliers. The SCoC 
applies broadly to suppliers, service providers, vendors, traders, agents, consultants, contractors, dealers, distributors, 
business associates, joint venture partners, and third parties, including their agents, and representatives, who engage in 
business dealings with the Company or any of its subsidiaries, aƯliates, or divisions.
 
 The suppliers are expected to comply fully with applicable laws, rules, and regulations, while also adhering to internationally 
recognized environmental, social, and governance standards. These standards encompass the well-being of employees, 
anti-harassment and anti-discrimination measures, and the abolition of child and forced labour. SpeciƬcally, the Supplier 
Code of Conduct emphasizes adherence to all relevant local, state, and national human rights laws, respect for the right 
to freedom of association and collective bargaining, and the prohibition of forced, bonded, compulsory, indentured, 
or prison labour. Additionally, it mandates providing equal employment opportunities, compliance with laws regarding 
working hours, minimum wages, and beneƬts, and upholding laws related to slavery and human traƯcking.
 
 Through the integration of these rigorous standards into the Companyos contractual agreements, The Company ensures 
that human rights considerations are a fundamental aspect of its business operations and supplier relationships. 
This approach not only reinforces its commitment to ethical practices but also promotes a responsible and 
sustainable supply chain.

Outcome of the initiative
1
Installation of 
RTPFC
Installed a new Reactive Power Factor Correction 
(RTPFC) system to enhance power factor and 
reduce power losses.
This initiative led to a reduction in 
power consumption, which translated 
into cost savings and a decrease in 
energy-related emissions.
2
Application of AC 
Motors
Converted DC motors to more energy-eƯcient AC 
motors and installed Variable Frequency Drives 
(VFDs) on wire drawing machines and coolant 
pumps.
This resulted in signiƬcant energy 
savings during both operational 
and idle modes, leading to reduced 
electricity consumption and 
operational costs.
3
Installation of LED 
Lights and LDR 
Sensors
Replaced traditional lighting with 150 Watt LED 
lamps and installed Light Dependent Resistor 
(LDR) sensors for automatic control of lighting 
based on visibility.
The transition to LED lighting and the 
use of LDR sensors reduced energy 
consumption and maintenance costs, 
contributing to lower greenhouse gas 
emissions.
4
Upgradation of 
Energy EƯcient 
Chillers, Pumps, 
and Cooling 
Towers
Upgraded to energy-eƯcient chillers, pumps, 
and cooling towers and implemented Variable 
Frequency Drives (VFDs) for cooling tower pump 
motors.
This upgrade resulted in substantial 
energy savings and improved cooling 
eƯciency, reducing overall power 
consumption and environmental 
impact.

Outcome of the initiative
5
Overhauling MWD 
Lines and Other 
Machinery
Overhauled the MWD (Multi-Wire Drawing) lines 
and other machinery to improve overall machine 
eƯciency and reduce energy consumption.
This initiative led to enhanced machine 
performance, reduced energy use, and 
improved production eƯciency.
6
High-Speed 
Insulation Lines 
Installation
Installed high-speed insulation lines capable of 
production speeds up to 1200 meters per minute, 
enhancing power eƯciency and product quality.
The new insulation lines achieved 
better power savings and improved 
product quality, leading to increased 
productivity and reduced waste.
7
Coiling Machines 
Driven Payoƪs 
Upgradation
Upgraded coiling machines with motor-less conical 
payoƪs to replace traditional designs
This upgrade resulted in power 
savings, fewer breakdowns, and 
enhanced operational eƯciency.
8
800mm Dual Take-
up
Replaced the old 630mm dual take-up with a more 
eƯcient 800mm dual take-up system.
The new system increased 
productivity, reduced breakdowns 
and scrap generation, and improved 
energy eƯciency.
9
New S7 Series PLC
The Old Buncher PLC Panel retroƬtted with 
New S7 Series PLC for improved control and 
automation.
This retroƬtting enhanced system 
reliability, reduced downtime, and 
improved operational eƯciency.

 The Company has established a comprehensive mechanism to address community grievances through the Stakeholders 
Relationship Committee and the CSR Committee. The Stakeholders Relationship Committee manages the overall 
grievance process, while the CSR Committee speciƬcally handles concerns related to community issues, working 
closely with local residents and stakeholders involved in CSR projects. Local residents near the plant can raise their 
concerns directly with the plant HR, and those participating in CSR programs can report issues during those interactions. 
This integrated approach ensures that grievances are promptly and eƪectively resolved, reƮecting the Companyos 
commitment to strong community relations.
