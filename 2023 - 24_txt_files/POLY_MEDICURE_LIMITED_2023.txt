Water & 
effluent 
management 
Risk 
Water 
availability 
could become a 
concern. As a 
responsible 
corporation, 
must map and 
manage its 
water usage 
across 
operations, 
ensuring 
consumption is 
both socially 
equitable and 
environmentally 
sustainable. 
We have implemented 
measures to reduce and 
conserve water across our 
manufacturing plants. 
Wastewater treatment and 
recycling systems have 
been established to 
decrease freshwater 
consumption, and 
rainwater harvesting is 
practiced replenishing 
groundwater. Treated 
wastewater is used for 
HVAC purposes, and high-
efficiency fixtures and 
low-flow taps have been 
installed to further 
enhance water 
conservation. 
Negative: Water 
scarcity can disrupt 
our operations, 
leading to financial

7 .  Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG 
related challenges, targets and achievements 
 
As the Director responsible for the Business Responsibility Report, I am pleased to reaffirm our 
commitment to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles. Integrating ESG into our 
business strategy is vital for long-term success and sustainability. One of our key challenges is 
balancing growth with environmental stewardship, as we work to manage our carbon footprint, 
resource consumption, and waste production in alignment with the SDGs. 
Additionally, addressing social responsibility, including fair labor practices, fostering diversity, 
and upholding high corporate governance standards, is complex in a rapidly evolving global 
environment. To meet these challenges, we are in the process of reducing carbon emissions, 
increase renewable energy use, achieve zero waste to landfill in key operations, and enhance 
diversity and employee well-being. 
Despite these challenges, we have made progress in reducing our carbon footprint, increasing 
renewable energy usage, adopting digital initiatives to reduce paper consumption, and improving 
waste management. We are also strengthening employee welfare, increasing gender diversity in 
leadership, and enhancing governance practices with greater transparency and ethical conduct. 
Looking ahead, we remain committed to achieving our ESG targets, believing that prioritizing ESG 
safeguards our business while contributing positively to society and the environment.

We prioritize energy management through renewable energy adoption, such as solar power, and 
optimize energy use with efficient lighting and HVAC systems. By monitoring consumption and 
embracing emission-reducing technologies like CNC machines, CNG vehicles, and PNG gensets, 
we minimize environmental impact. Sustainable transportation practices, such as shipment 
consolidation, further reduce GHG emissions. Additionally, digital initiatives, including paperless 
processes and automation, align with SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) and SDG 15 (Life on 
Land), reducing approximately 45 tCO2e.

We have established a procedure for receiving, processing, recording, and acting upon written,

Customer complaints regarding product quality or dispatches are communicated to the relevant 
Marketing team, either directly by the customer or through dealers/agents, along with details such 
as batch numbers and invoices. These complaints are given top priority and are escalated to the 
appropriate team—either the QC team at the plant for product quality issues or the sales Logistics 
team for dispatch-related concerns. For quality-related complaints, QC team members may visit 
the customer site, depending on the severity of the issue, to suggest corrective actions, either 
directly on-site or by analyzing samples of the affected material in our lab.
