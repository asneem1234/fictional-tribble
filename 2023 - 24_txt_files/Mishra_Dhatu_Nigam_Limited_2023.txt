achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
	
In the rapidly changing realm of sustainability, businesses are observing emerging trends that turn sustainable philosophy 
into practical actions, influencing both companies and their stakeholders. The post-pandemic world has sparked a global shift 
towards greater sustainability. MIDHANI, a distinguished manufacturer of alloys and special metals with over fifty years of 
experience, has consistently demonstrated its commitment to sustainability by carefully managing resources. Given its focus 
on strategic and critical national needs rather than mass commercial production, MIDHANI maintains a minimal environmental 
footprint. Beyond environmental stewardship, MIDHANI has always recognized its social responsibility, even before it became 
a mandate under the Companies Act of 2013. The company’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) projects revolve around 
education, health, and wellness, with a sincere desire to upskill and educate communities. MIDHANI actively engages its 
employees in CSR volunteering activities, providing them with a platform to interact with local communities, fostering a sense of 
purpose and satisfaction. As a Government-owned company, MIDHANI’s operations undergo rigorous scrutiny from esteemed 
authorities such as the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, the Administrative Ministry i.e. Ministry of Defence, the Central 
Vigilance Commission etc. This ensures transparency and accountability and integrity, further reinforcing their commitment to 
good governance. MIDHANI’s aim is to be a harbinger of positive change and impact, building upon their past achievements. 
With a resolute dedication to sustainability, MIDHANI continues its journey towards making sustainable choice.
