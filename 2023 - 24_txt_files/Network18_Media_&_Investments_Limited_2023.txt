1
Content 
veracity
Opportunity
Lapses in quality and 
veracity of news content 
has a negative impact 
on the society at large. 
Weaponisation of fake news 
perversely impacts mass 
psychology and can also 
threaten democratic values.
Against this backdrop, 
we as a media company 
are deeply invested in 
delivering correct and 
comprehensive news to our 
customers. We see this as 
not only an opportunity but 
also an obligation towards 
the society.
NA
Our viewers are 
increasingly 
appreciating our 
attempt to be the source 
of truth in an otherwise 
noisy environment. 
This fortifies our brand 
perception and ensures 
strong audience metrics. 
We see a positive 
financial implications of 
this over the long term.
2
Social impact
Opportunity
The Company believes in 
respect for all, justice for all. 
The starting point of good 
journalism is respect, for 
individuals and institutions. 
The Company stands up for 
what is right and demands 
justice for all citizens, 
especially the weakest 
among us.
NA
Strong editorial 
standards and practices 
help us establish a 
distinct brand identity 
and a leadership 
position in the market.

3
Talent 
Management
Risk
Talent is the key 
differentiator in the success 
of any organisation, 
however, for a media 
organisation, dependence 
on people for success is 
disproportionately high. 
Also, with technology 
driving rapid evolution of 
the content production 
and consumption patterns, 
the need for continuous 
upskilling is paramount for 
success.
The Company is executing 
multiple initiatives to attract 
and retain talent. The 
Company is taking several 
initiatives for building 
‘Employee Brand’ to attract 
good talent.
The Company is cognizant 
of the need for upgrading 
the skills of employees and 
organises various in-house 
and external training sessions. 
The Company partners with 
various online learning 
platforms like LinkedIn 
learning, Coursera, etc. and 
provides unlimited
access to more than 16k+ 
online tutorials to its 
employees.
Availability of top talent 
remains scarce and if the 
Company is unable to 
attract people who are 
domain experts, it might 
hamper the chances of 
success. Further, pace of 
technological evolution 
makes it challenging to 
continuously upgrade 
skills of employees and 
might lead to gaps in the 
organisation skill matrix.
4
Diversity and 
Inclusion
Opportunity
A diverse workforce has a 
direct and disproportionate 
impact on improving 
productivity and business 
performance.
NA
A workplace, teeming 
with people from diverse 
backgrounds, genders, 
sexual orientations and 
geographies allows for 
improved flow of ideas, 
innovation, awareness 
and creativity. This 
diversity contributes to 
more balanced decision 
making, higher output 
and an enhanced 
reputation.

Data 
Protection
Risk
Protection of user data is 
crucial to earning consumer 
trust and preventing misuse 
of data by unscrupulous 
elements.
The Company has a robust 
mechanism to safeguard 
user data. Also, the Company 
sensitises its employees on 
regular basis on various cyber 
security issues.
Any incident of data 
breach or cyber security 
attack can harm 
Company’s competitive 
advantage and can make 
the Company vulnerable 
to legal action.
6
Business 
Ethics, 
Integrity and 
Transparency
Risk
Ethics and integrity have 
always been the key values 
to acquire stakeholder 
trust and establish a strong 
reputation. These elements 
are essential for the 
Company in order to sustain 
in long term. Any deviation 
from ethical standards can 
cause business instability.
The Company has requisite 
policies and it imparts training 
to equip employees with 
the required understanding 
and knowledge to conduct 
business ethically and prevent, 
identify, and respond to 
violations. The Company has 
rolled out Whistleblower 
policy and Anti-Bribery & 
Anti-Corruption Policy under 
which complaint can be made 
to Ethics and Compliance 
Task Force without any fear of 
retaliation.
Non-adherence might 
lead to difficulties in 
dealing with concerns of 
ethics, non-compliance, 
and violations of 
company's principles. 
The same may cause 
damage to corporate 
reputation.
7
Regulatory 
issues and 
compliance
Risk
It is crucial for the Company 
to maintain regulatory 
compliance to foster 
confidence among its 
stakeholder groups and to 
ensure that its operations 
are compliant with 
applicable laws in order to 
prevent legal violations.
The risk of non-compliance 
within the Company is 
mitigated by a robust 
compliance management 
framework. The Company has 
adopted a digitally enabled 
comprehensive compliance
management framework. 
Effective control and efficient 
oversight by the senior 
management is ensured by 
cascading the responsibility 
matrix till the last performer of 
the activity.
Non-adherence to 
regulatory requirements 
can undermine 
stakeholder trust, 
damage reputation and 
disrupt business.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details.
	
Due to the nature of its operations, the Company doesn’t have any significant Green House Gas(GHG) emission. However, the 
Company is continuously evaluating ways to reduce electricity consumption. Few initiatives have been taken by the Company for 
reducing GHG emissions as below –
	
Project1: Shift from Halogen lights to LED for facility including studios.
	
Outcome: Under this Initiative, the Company has shifted to LED lights in last 1 year for energy efficiency and environmental 
impact. LED lights use 20-25% less energy and last 17 times longer than incandescent bulbs reducing GHG emissions both by 
energy saving and reduced electronic waste.
	
Project2: Facility consolidation for news operations of Hindi Speaking Market channels.
	
Outcome: This consolidation has resulted in benefits, such as synergy between the teams, power conservation, and savings on 
travel cost. In terms of power saving alone, there is an average monthly reduction in power consumption by 125 kW, reducing 
carbon footprint and GHG emission.
