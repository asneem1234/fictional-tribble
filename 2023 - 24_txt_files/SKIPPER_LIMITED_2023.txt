GHG 
emissions 
management
Risk &
Opportunity
Risk:
Skipper’s 
engineering 
products 
require multiple energy sources in 
their manufacturing process. The 
fossil fuels used in fabrication and 
galvanizing 
processes 
produce 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. 
The 
Company 
has 
a 
strong 
presence 
in 
both 
Indian 
and 
international markets, where there 
is a heightened focus on managing 
GHG emissions. Therefore, failing 
to address emissions could lead to 
higher costs of doing business.
Opportunity:
Implementing proactive measures 
to reduce the carbon footprint 
of our products would align with 
customer preferences, open new 
markets, and reinforce Skipper’s 
commitment 
as 
a 
responsible 
global player.
The 
Company 
is 
taking 
a 
comprehensive 
approach 
to understanding its carbon 
footprint at the facility and 
product levels. It has initiated 
a phased replacement of CO2 
gas with an 80:20 Argon-CO2 
mixture, which helps reduce 
emissions.
The Company has initiated a 
Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) for 
its two product lines towers and 
poles. This initiative is driven by 
the need to align with emerging 
regulations 
and 
compliance 
requirements, 
particularly 
in 
international markets where the 
company exports its products.

2
Energy 
Management
Risk &
Opportunity
Risk:
Skipper’s manufacturing process 
requires various sources of energy 
with electricity contributing to a 
quarter of its energy mix.  Therefore, 
the company recognizes the need 
to adopt technology to maximize 
energy 
efficiency. 
Inefficient 
energy management could result 
in increased production costs for 
the Company.
Opportunity:
Initiatives 
focusing 
on 
energy-
efficient practices offer a distinct 
opportunity for cost reduction 
and 
competitive 
advantage. 
Implementing such technologies 
can 
lower 
operational 
costs, 
improve 
margins, 
and 
help 
mitigate climate change impacts. 
Transitioning to renewable energy 
sources provides access to cleaner 
and more efficient energy, thereby 
enhancing 
our 
sustainability 
efforts and market position.
The 
Company 
is 
equipped 
with 3 MW solar plants across 
all 
three 
units, 
generating 
20,56,280 kWh.
Initiatives 
like 
daylight 
harvesting 
systems, 
installing 
LED lights, and VFD installations 
reduce the Company’s reliance 
on fossil fuel-generated energy.
As 
part 
of 
its 
energy 
management 
initiatives, 
the 
Company is proud to announce 
its recognition as a winner in the 
Encon Awards 2023, organized 
by CII, for Excellence in Energy 
Conservation. This achievement 
highlights 
the 
Company’s 
ongoing 
commitment 
to 
sustainable 
practices 
and 
environmental stewardship.
Positive and
Negative
3
Water and 
Effluent 
Management
Risk
Risk:
Water is integral to the Company’s 
operations, 
particularly 
in 
the 
rolling mills. These mills require 
water for cooling hot metals, 
a process that leads to water 
evaporation upon contact with 
heated 
surfaces. 
Additionally, 
water is consumed in galvanized 
iron (GI) operations for rinsing 
and chemical dilution purposes. 
Moreover, 
during 
quenching 
activities, 
products 
undergo 
immersion 
in 
water 
tubs 
for 
cooling.
Inefficient use of water may lead 
to depletion of natural resources. 
Further, if the effluents are not 
managed well, it will adversely 
impact health, the environment 
and ecology and can also lead to 
regulatory sanctions.
The 
Company 
acknowledges 
the 
significance 
of 
water 
management 
and 
has 
implemented 
several 
water-
saving initiatives that reduce the 
withdrawal of fresh water.
The 
Company 
has 
installed 
sewage treatment plants (STPs) 
and effluent treatment plants 
(ETPs) to ensure that the water 
discharged from its operations 
undergoes 
proper 
treatment 
before being released or reused 
in the operations.

Waste 
Management
Risk
Opportunity
Risk:
Given the nature of the sector, the 
manufacturing process generates 
both 
hazardous 
and 
non-
hazardous waste. Improper waste 
management may lead to negative 
health 
impacts 
on 
employees, 
workers, 
and 
surrounding 
community members. Additionally, 
it can result in regulatory sanctions 
and 
damage 
the 
Company’s 
reputation.
Opportunity:
By implementing comprehensive 
waste management, the company 
demonstrates 
its 
environmental 
and social consciousness, positively 
impacting 
the 
environment. 
Additionally, 
reducing 
waste 
generation during the process has 
a positive financial impact.
The 
Company’s 
waste 
management practices adhere 
to statutory regulations and 
industry benchmarks, ensuring 
compliance at every stage.
The 
Company’s 
tower 
and 
polymer 
units 
promote 
the 
efficient 
utilization 
of 
raw 
materials, fostering responsible 
resource usage throughout the 
operations.
Positive and Negative
5
Occupational
Health and
Safety
Risk and
Opportunity
Risk:
The 
manufacturing 
process 
involves handling chemicals and 
working with heavy machinery. 
Ineffective 
management 
of 
occupational 
health 
and 
safety 
practices can expose employees 
to various risks, including physical 
and ergonomic hazards, potentially 
resulting in fatalities.
Inadequate safety measures can 
increase employee turnover rates, 
leading to a loss of productivity 
and a negative reputational impact 
on the Company.
Opportunities:
Implementing 
a 
culture 
that 
prioritizes 
health 
and 
safety 
initiatives, 
including 
ongoing 
training, equipment upkeep and 
hazard identification, along with 
routine 
evaluations 
and 
safety 
certifications, enhances the safety 
and well-being of employees and 
workers. This proactive approach 
not 
only 
ensures 
increased 
productivity but also underscores 
the 
company’s 
commitment 
to fostering a secure working 
environment.
The Company has implemented 
ISO 
45001:2018 
across 
all 
operational and project sites, 
ensuring stringent adherence to 
international standards.
The 
Company’s 
commitment 
to safety is demonstrated by 
the establishment of a Safety 
Apex Committee, chaired by 
the Managing Director and with 
active involvement from all the top 
management 
members. 
Apex 
Committees are safety Policy-
making 
committees 
whereas 
Divisional 
Implementation 
Committees (DIC) are the policy 
implementation 
committees. 
This 
governance 
framework 
highlights a steadfast dedication 
to 
upholding 
a 
safe 
and 
sustainable work environment.
The Company conducts routine 
internal safety assessments led 
by dedicated safety teams at 
each facility. Regular training 
sessions 
for 
employees 
emphasize the importance of 
maintaining 
a 
safe 
working 
environment.

Effectively 
managing

in 
the Company not only aligns 
with ethical principles but also 
brings tangible benefits in terms 
of innovation, talent acquisition, 
employee engagement, reputation 
management, and compliance.
The 
Company 
has 
achieved 
“Great Place to Work” certification 
for the third consecutive time. This 
achievement underscores the firm 
belief that success goes beyond 
project accomplishments, it’s also 
about fostering a strong team and

Risk
Adhering to human rights principles 
is a fundamental obligation for the 
company. 
Ensuring 
compliance 
with 
human 
rights 
laws 
and 
regulations 
is 
paramount. 
Any 
lapses in this regard can result in 
legal ramifications and adversely 
impact the company’s reputation 
and brand image.
The 
Company 
is 
firmly 
dedicated to safeguarding the 
human rights of its employees 
and workers. It has aligned its 
human rights provisions with all 
statutory requirements. Further, 
the Company has implemented 
a 
whistle-blower 
mechanism 
for employees and workers to 
report any violations of human 
rights.

Community 
Development
Opportunity
Engaging with communities is 
integral to responsible corporate 
behaviour, 
fostering 
inclusive 
growth and trust. By actively 
participating 
in 
community 
initiatives and corporate social 
responsibility (CSR), the company 
can 
gain 
insights 
into 
social, 
economic, 
and 
environmental 
contexts, 
nurturing 
stronger 
stakeholder 
relationships 
and 
fostering innovation. This proactive 
approach not only benefits society 
but also helps build trust within 
communities, 
contributing 
to 
sustainable growth and positive 
impact.

Yes, the Company demonstrates a firm commitment to occupational health and safety through its established Occupational 
Health and Safety Management System (OHSMS). This robust system encompasses all operational units, ensuring consistent 
adherence to standardized safety protocols and effective risk management strategies.
	
	
Management provides all the required resources, such as manpower, equipment and a suitable healthy and safe work 
environment for all the employees and workers. Further, the Company has implemented an Integrated Management 
System (IMS) that adheres to International Organization for Standardization (ISO 45001, ISO 14001, ISO 9001) standards. 
This approach signifies the Company's dedication to responsible and holistic management practices, further solidifying its 
commitment to employee well-being.
	
b.	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by the 
entity?
	
	
The Company’s health and safety teams conduct regular on-site assessments and hazard identification and risk assessment 
(HIRA). Risk management includes risk elimination, control, acceptance and transfer.  Risks are classified into low, medium 
and high categories, and corrective action is taken based on the likelihood and severity. Further, the Company also involves 
the employees and workers in identifying the aspects, impacts, hazards, risks, objective setting, mock drill, etc. Toolbox talks 
are held once in three days which helps employees and workers with discussions on safety issues.
	
	
We have implemented multiple mechanisms to encourage workers to report work-related hazards and hazardous situations. 
Workers are encouraged to report such incidents to their immediate process owner or supervisor. Additionally, they can 
inform dedicated safety teams across the units. Suggestion boxes are strategically placed in various locations where workers 
can anonymously report any incidents or hazards, they encounter.
	
	
Our Incident Management process involves investigation, communication, recording and controlling, as well as root cause 
analysis for prevention measures. In case of any incident, our EHS team immediately investigates and communicates the 
necessary information to all relevant parties. The team records all incidents in an Incident Register and takes necessary 
corrective actions to prevent future incidents. They also conduct root cause analysis to identify the cause of the incident and 
implement measures to prevent its recurrence.

The Company promotes a proactive safety culture by encouraging both employees and workers to report any potential 
hazards such as unsafe work practices, risky behaviour, or near misses, directly to the health and safety team. When 
encountering such situations, individuals are advised to prioritize their safety by stepping away from the process until a 
thorough investigation identifies the root cause and corrective actions are implemented.
	
d.	
Do the employees/workers of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services? (Yes/ No)
	
	
The Company has a strong commitment to employee health and well-being through a comprehensive group healthcare 
package. The Company launched a worker health promotion program for all employees, collaborating with a nearby hospital 
close to its Uluberia facility. As part of this initiative, the Company offers financial assistance for the cost of health check-ups. 
All employees and workers are covered under health insurance, and eligible employees have access to the Employee State 
Insurance Corporation (ESIC) program. Additionally, the company conducts regular health checkup programs tailored to the 
needs of the workforce.

The Company is committed to minimizing its water footprint and has implemented several successful initiatives.  It strictly adheres 
to all the statutory norms and requirements prescribed by CPCB across all the plants. In the Uluberia plant, the galvanizing 
iron (GI) unit operates entirely on treated water. Additionally, a state-of-the-art effluent treatment plant (ETP) with a capacity of 
150 KLD for iron removal has been installed, enabling the reuse of iron-contaminated water within processes. This approach 
significantly reduces our dependence on groundwater resources, promoting the conservation of this vital natural resource. This 
project represents another significant step towards promoting a sustainable galvanization process.
