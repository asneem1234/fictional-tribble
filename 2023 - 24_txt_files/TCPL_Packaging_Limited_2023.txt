1.
Energy 
Management
Opportunity
Opportunity:
Energy from electricity is a key 
component 
of 
the 
Company’s 
manufacturing process, constituting 
over 80% of its energy consumption 
from the grid. Implementing energy-
efficient practices can lead to significant 
cost savings and reduce environmental 
impact.
Integrating renewable energy sources 
into its energy mix would enable the 
Company to transition towards a more 
sustainable future by reducing the 
dependence on grid electricity derived 
from fossil fuels.
NA
Positive 
2.
Waste 
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk:
The manufacturing process primarily 
generates non-hazardous waste and 
small quantities of hazardous waste. 
Improper waste management poses 
health and safety risks to employees, 
workers, 
surrounding 
communities, 
and the environment. Poor waste 
management practices may also lead 
to compliance issues and penalties.
To mitigate risks in waste 
management, the Company 
strives to minimize waste 
generation by adopting newer 
technologies and complying 
with 
local 
and 
national 
regulations.
The Company has established 
processes and practices for 
properly handling, storing,

and 
non-hazardous 
waste. 
It 
segregates 
its 
waste 
and engages with CPCB/
SPCB-approved vendors for 
disposal.
3.
Water 
Management
Opportunity
Opportunity:
The Company’s operations require 
water as a key input, and it strives to 
reduce its water usage. Deploying a 
rainwater harvesting system reduces 
its 
dependence 
on 
groundwater 
and 
contributes 
to 
groundwater 
recharge. The Company has set up 
effluent treatment plants wherever 
it is necessary to achieve zero liquid 
discharge. The treated water is used 
for gardening purposes.
Additionally, the Company is in the 
process of deploying STP across plants 
to reuse the water for gardening and 
toilet flushing.
NA
Positive
4.
Emissions 
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk:
Effective emission management is 
critical for the Company to mitigate 
climate change risks, minimize adverse 
impacts on the environment and 
public health, and promote sustainable 
operations. 
Opportunity:
Since the Company’s GHG emissions 
are primarily related to grid-based 
electricity, 
effectively 
mitigating 
and managing energy consumption 
could create significant economic, 
environmental, and social benefits for 
the business.
Effective 
emissions 
management 
provides 
the 
Company 
with 
a 
sustainable advantage by creating new 
business opportunities, as customers 
are increasingly demanding a lower 
carbon footprint in their supply chain.
The Company understands 
the importance of reducing 
its greenhouse gas emissions. 
It has created an emission 
inventory and is monitoring 
emissions across all the units.
Energy audits have been 
conducted 
across 
facilities 
to 
identify 
areas 
for 
improvement 
in 
energy 
efficiency and potential cost-
saving measures.
Additionally, the Company 
is 
implementing 
methods 
and 
systems 
that 
reduce 
greenhouse gases wherever 
possible. It has installed 3.286 
MW capacity of solar panels 
across all its units to minimize 
its 
dependence 
on 
grid 
energy.

Occupational 
Health and 
Safety
Risk & 
Opportunity
Risk:
Poor management of occupational 
health and safety practices can lead 
to various risks, such as ergonomic 
injuries, fire hazards, and other safety-
related risks. Proper implementation 
and monitoring of health and safety 
protocols is crucial to safeguarding 
employee well-being and preventing 
potential accidents or injuries.
Opportunity:
By prioritizing health and safety in the 
workplace, companies can safeguard 
their 
employees 
and 
minimize 
accidents. This proactive approach 
ensures workforce protection and 
fosters a safer and more productive 
work environment.
The 
Company 
has 
implemented 
ISO 
45001 
across 
all 
facilities. 
This 
ensures 
adherence 
to 
stringent 
procedures 
and 
safety 
protocols, 
thereby 
minimizing potential risks.
Continuous 
safety 
training 
equips 
employees 
with 
the 
necessary 
skills 
and 
knowledge. 
Hazard 
management processes and 
measures ensure the effective 
implementation of mitigation 
techniques 
throughout 
operations.
To 
ensure 
safety, 
the 
Company provides personal 
protective 
equipment 
(PPE) for all employees and 
workers. 
It 
also 
conducts 
regular internal and external 
safety assessments, engages 
its workforce through various 
channels, 
including 
health 
and safety committees, and 
displays information related 
to health and safety protocols 
on Company premises.

Responsible 
Sourcing
Opportunity
Opportunity:
Implementing efficient supply chain 
management, which includes sourcing 
from local suppliers and responsibly 
acquiring raw materials, presents a 
substantial growth avenue for the 
Company. Nearly a quarter of its raw 
materials are FSC-certified.
The sustainable procurement policy and 
supplier Code of Conduct encourage 
all its business partners to integrate 
sustainable, responsible practices into 
their operations. This strengthens the 
Company’s relationships with suppliers 
and reinforces its commitment to 
ethical practices throughout the supply 
chain, fostering trust and sustainability.

Customer 
Satisfaction
Risk & 
Opportunity
Risk: 
The Company manufactures packaging 
material for leading players in FMCG, 
pharmaceuticals, tobacco, food and 
beverage, e-commerce, and consumer 
durables and electronics. Poor quality 
practices can lead to physical damage, 
product recalls, health risks for end 
users, and reputational risks for the 
Company.
Opportunity:
Maintaining 
the 
highest 
quality 
standards 
through 
responsible 
manufacturing 
and 
marketing 
processes can help win customer 
trust 
and 
secure 
more 
business 
opportunities.
The 
Company’s 
regular 
engagement and feedback 
sessions 
provide 
valuable 
insights 
into 
tailoring 
its 
packaging solutions to meet 
its clients’ specific quality and 
sustainability requirements.

technology, rigorous quality 
control 
protocols, 
and 
a 
commitment 
to 
ongoing 
enhancement.

Addressing 
human 
rights 
issues 
proactively can help mitigate risks 
like legal liabilities and negative 
publicity, safeguarding the Company’s 
long-term viability. External audits of 
environmental and labour standards, 
health, 
and 
safety 
underscore 
the 
Company’s 
commitment 
to 
transparency 
in 
human 
rights 
management.

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG-related challenges, targets, 
and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
	
As we navigate the dynamic business landscape, we must remain focused on our commitment to sustainability. Today, more 
than ever, our actions have profound implications for our planet’s and society’s future.
	
Our investments in energy, water, and waste conservation aim to minimize our environmental footprint. By implementing 
newer technologies and practices, we are optimizing costs, safeguarding natural resources, and setting a strong foundation 
for sustainability. In 2022-23, we conducted energy audits across our plants and implemented the suggestions this year, 
reducing our energy consumption. This year, we also underwent an SMETA audit that helped us meet customer requirements 
and validate our sustainability efforts. 
	
We launched our sustainable procurement policy, an initiative for environmental stewardship and social responsibility, and 
a strategic move that benefits our company and stakeholders. By partnering with suppliers who share our values, we are 
ensuring the quality of our products, enhancing our reputation, and contributing to a more sustainable business environment. 
This year, we procured close to a quarter of our paperboard, our primary raw material, from FSC-certified sources.
	
Our management, employees, and workers are at the heart of our sustainability ethos. We continue to invest in comprehensive 
training programs for our workforce and management. We foster a culture of awareness and accountability by equipping our 
team with knowledge and tools and acknowledging their crucial role in our sustainability journey.
	
Our commitment to corporate social responsibility extends far beyond our factory walls. Through impactful CSR initiatives 
in healthcare and education, we contribute to making a difference in the lives of our communities. We reaffirm our role as a 
responsible corporate citizen by prioritizing initiatives that promote inclusivity and well-being.
	
We believe that sustainability is not just a responsibility but an opportunity to create value for all stakeholders. We will 
continue to work towards our sustainability goals and make a positive impact on the environment and society.

Independent Assurance Statement
The Board of Directors
TCPL Packaging Limited,
Empire Mills Complex,
414, Senapati Bapat Marg, 
Lower Parel, Mumbai,
Maharashtra - 400013
Subject: Independent assurance report on the Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions of TCPL Packing Limited (hereafter referred as “TCPL” 
/ “Company”) for the year ended March 31, 2024
Moore Singhi Advisors LLP (“Moore Singhi” / “we” / “us”) have been engaged by TCPL Packaging Limited to perform a limited 
assurance engagement on the Company’s Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions (the “Subject Matter”) for the period April 1, 2023 to 
March 31, 2024 vide engagement letter dated January 15, 2024. This engagement covers the following facilities: Haridwar, Dapada, 
Goa, Guwahati, Silvassa and the Corporate Office.
1.	
TCPL responsibilities
	
TCPL management is responsible for selecting the methodology and presenting the GHG emissions disclosures in accordance 
with that methodology in all material respects. This responsibility includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of 
internal control, including policies and processes, maintenance of adequate records, calculations, and making estimates that 
are reasonable in the circumstances, and ensuring that they are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
	
The methodology used by TCPL for compiling and reporting GHG emissions for FY 2023-24 is based on “The GHG Protocol 
Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition)” by the World Resources Institute (WRI) / World Business 
Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). As a result, the Subject Matter information may not be suitable for other 
purposes.
2.	
Moore Singhi responsibilities
	
Our responsibility is to provide limited assurance that the subject matter is in accordance with methodology devised by the 
Company, based on our examination of the records and computations prepared by the management.
	
A limited assurance engagement includes performing procedures to obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence on the reporting 
criteria. In this connection, we have performed the following procedures:
	
1.	
Reviewed the procedures for GHG emission reporting and its compliance with the WRI/WBCSD GHG Protocol.
	
2.	
Conducted discussions with individuals responsible for managing the GHG emission inventory at the sites. Discussions 
at Masat and Dapada plants were conducted in person and remotely at other locations.
	
3.	
Verified procedures used for data collection, quantification, and computations.
	
4.	
Evaluated the appropriateness of the quantification methods and models used in the preparation of the GHG 
report.	
	
5.	
Checked the sources of emission factors and their applicability according to the chosen methodologies.
	
6.	
Tested, on a sample basis, the evidence supporting the data and information.
	
7.	
Assessed the reasonableness of assumptions, estimations, and thresholds considered in calculations.
	
8.	
We also performed such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. 
	
While we considered the effectiveness of management’s internal controls when planning the nature and scope of our procedures, 
our assurance engagement was not intended to provide assurance on these controls. Our procedures did not involve testing 
internal controls or verifying the aggregation and calculation of data within the IT systems.
	
We conducted our assurance engagement in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 
3000 (Revised): Assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of historical financial information, and the International 
Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3410: Assurance engagements on greenhouse gas statements, as well as the 
terms of reference for this engagement as agreed with TCPL on January 15, 2024. 
	
Those standards require that we plan and perform our engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether, in all material 
respects, the Subject Matter presented to us is in accordance with the methodology, and to issue a report.
A N N U A L  R E P O R T  2 0 2 3 - 2 0 2 4
181
	
The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from and are less in extent than for, 
a reasonable assurance engagement, and consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement 
is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been 
performed.
	
We have complied with independence and all other ethical requirements, which are founded on the fundamental principles of 
integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour. 
3.	
Conclusion
	
Based on our procedures as mentioned in the section “Moore Singhi responsibilities”, information and explanations given 
and management representations provided to us, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the GHG 
emissions for the period from April 1, 2023 to March 31, 2024 is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the 
methodology adopted by the company.
	
The reported GHG emissions for the period from April 1, 2023 to March 31, 2024 are:
 
• 
Scope 1: 3,185 metric tonnes of CO2 equivalent
 
• 
Scope 2: 28,606 metric tonnes of CO2 equivalent
4.	
Uncertainties
	
The reliability of assurance is subject to uncertainties inherent in the assurance process. These uncertainties may arise due to 
the limitations in quantification models, assumptions, or conversion factors used or may be present in estimation of data to 
arrive at results. As a result, our conclusions regarding this assurance are subject to any inherent uncertainties involved in the 
process.
5.	
Restriction on Use 
	
Our work was performed solely to assist management in meeting their responsibilities in relation to TCPL’s supply chain 
assessment reporting requirements. The report is addressed to and provided to the Board of Directors of the Company solely 
for the purpose of enabling it to comply with the aforementioned requirements and should not be used, referred to, or 
distributed for any other purpose or to any other party without our prior written consent. Accordingly, we do not accept or 
assume any liability or duty of care for any other purpose for which or to any other person to whom this assurance report is 
shown or into whose hands it may come without our prior consent in writing. 
	
Other than as described in the paragraph 1, which sets out the scope of our engagement, we did not perform any assurance 
procedures on the remaining information. Accordingly, we do not express a conclusion on this information.
