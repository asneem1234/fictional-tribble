fixed and mobile broadband networks. Our products have a huge positive impact on society by enabling telecom service providers to bridge 
the rapidly growing “digital divide” by servicing billions of poor, bottom-of-pyramid consumers in rural and remote areas who would otherwise 
have been bereft of broadband connectivity for access to modern education, employment, healthcare and financial services. Moreover, the 
availability of high-speed broadband also has a positive environmental impact by allowing users to cut carbon emissions by teleworking, video 
conferencing, remote healthcare consultations, e-commerce, online banking, smart metering and other applications that reduce both road and 
air travel.
