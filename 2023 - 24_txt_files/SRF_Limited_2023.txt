Independent Assurance Statement
To, 
SRF Limited 
The Galleria, DLF Mayur Vihar, 
Unit No. 236 & 237, Second Floor, 
Mayur Place, Noida Link Road, 
Mayur Vihar Phase-1 Extn, Delhi 110 091 
Independent Assurance Statement to 
SRF Limited on BRSR Core non-financial 
sustainability disclosures in the Business 
Responsibility and Sustainability Report for 
the financial year 2023-24.
Introduction and objective of engagement 
SRF Limited (the ‘Company’) has developed its 
Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report 
(BRSR) (the ‘Report’) based on the BRSR reporting 
guidelines including the BRSR Core indicators 
prescribed by SEBI for listed entities. The reporting 
criteria have been derived from the Principles of 
National Guidelines on Responsible Business Conduct 
(NGRBC), and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol - A 
Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. 
BDO India LLP was engaged by the Company to 
provide independent assurance on BRSR Core 
indicators of the Report that includes the Company’s 
performance for the period 1st April 2023 through 
31st  March 2024. 
The Company’s responsibilities 
The report content and its presentation are the sole 
responsibilities of the management of the Company. 
The Company management is also responsible for the 
design, implementation, and maintenance of internal 
controls relevant to the preparation of the Report, so 
that it is free from material misstatement. 
BDO’s responsibilities 
BDO’s responsibility, as agreed with the management 
of the Company, is to provide reasonable assurance 
on the non-financial information of the BRSR Core 
indicators as described in the ‘Scope & boundary of 
assurance’ section below. We do not accept or assume 
any responsibility for any other purpose or to any other 
person or organization. Any reliance a third party may 
place on the Report is entirely at its own risk. 
Assurance standard 
We conducted our assurance engagement in 
accordance with International Standard on Assurance 
Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised), “Assurance 
Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical 
Financial Information” and ISAE 3410, “Assurance 
Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statement” issued 
by the International Auditing and Standards Board. 
We applied the criteria of ‘Reasonable’ assurance. 
Scope & boundary of assurance 
We have assured non-financial information of the 
BRSR Core indicators1 in the Report, pertaining to 
Company’s performance for the period 1st April 2023 
through 31st March 2024. 
The scope and boundary of Company’s reporting as 
well as our assurance cover the Company’s operations 
as defined in Section A (General Disclosures) 
of the Report. 
Assurance methodology 
Our assurance process entailed conducting procedures 
to gather evidence regarding the reliability of the 
disclosures covered in the assurance scope. 
Verification of non-financial sustainability performance 
data, was conducted at the following manufacturing 
facilities, on a sample basis, based on our 
professional judgement: 
•	
Chemical Business: Dahej and Bhiwadi Site 
•	
Packaging Films Business: Indore Site [Domestic 
Tariff Area 1 (DTA1), Domestic Tariff Area 
2 (DTA2), Special Economic Zone (SEZ)] 
and Kashipur Site 
1 SEBI vide SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD-SEC-2/P/CIR/2023/122 dated 12 July 2023
128
These manufacturing facilities, combined, represent 
approximately 80% of the revenue generated 
by the Company.
We conducted a review and verification of data 
collection, collation, and calculation methodologies, 
and a general review of the logic of inclusion/ omission 
of relevant information/ data in the Report. 
Our review process included: 
•	
Evaluate and assess the appropriateness of the 
quantification methods used to arrive at the 
non-financial sustainability information of BRSR 
Core indicators in the Report; 
•	
Review of consistency of data/information 
within the report as well as between the 
Report and source; 
•	
Engagement through discussions with personnel 
at both corporate and business unit levels who 
are accountable for the data and information 
presented in the Report; 
•	
Execution of an audit trail of claims and data 
streams, to determine the level of accuracy in 
collection, transcription, and aggregation; 
•	
Review of data collection and management 
procedures, and related internal controls. 
Inherent limitations 
There are inherent limitations in an assurance 
engagement, including, for example, the use 
of 
judgment 
and 
selective 
testing 
of 
data. 
Accordingly, there are possibilities that material 
misstatements in the sustainability information 
of the BRSR Core indicators in the Report may 
remain undetected. 
The assurance scope excludes: 
•	
Data and information outside the defined reporting 
period (1st April 2023 to 31st March 2024); 
•	
Any information not covered in ‘Scope & 
boundary of assurance’; 
•	
Review of the ‘economic and/or financial 
performance indicators’ included in the Report 
or on which reporting is based; we have been 
informed by the Company that these are derived 
from the Company’s audited financial records; 
•	
The 
Company’s 
statements 
that 
describe 
the expression of opinion, belief, inference, 
aspiration, expectation, aim, or future intention. 
Our observations 
During our review and assurance, we observed 
that the process of consolidation of data from 
different sources at plant level, needs to be further 
strengthened. Certain data collation and compilation 
discrepancies, which were noted during our review, 
were 
subsequently 
corrected. 
Additionally, 
the 
Company may consider augmented processes for 
maintenance of evidence trail of back-up data of 
reported information, for enhancing auditability. 
Our above observations, however, does not affect our 
conclusion regarding the Report. 
Our conclusion  
Based on the scope of our review, we conclude 
that the non-financial sustainability disclosures as 
mentioned in ‘Scope and boundary of assurance’ fairly 
fulfil the criteria of relevance, completeness, reliability, 
neutrality, and understandability.
