1
Aged Building Risk
Few identified offices of the 
Company are situated in buildings 
that are more than 30 years old 
posing health and safety risk 
to employees and third parties 
visiting these offices.
Company is limiting and/ or reducing 
the risk probability by continuing 
analysing unsafe areas within the 
building, monitoring the movement 
of material and individuals, 
institutionalising multiple exit paths, 
and enabling effective response 
strategy in case of a mishap. Company 
is in constant touch with building 
owner who is a Government authority 
to carry out structural repairs and 
maintenance 
work in the building.
Negative implications 
as any single event may 
cause serious injury to an 
individual.
2
Skill 
availability 
and retention
Risk, 
Opportunity
Growing market with newer 
business models require specific 
skills with lesser lead time. This 
gets further challenging as the 
organisations are adopting remote 
or hybrid ways of working. At the 
same time, this is an opportunity 
to source talent from newer 
locations not tried before, 
opening up a much wider talent 
landscape.
Company continues to evolve ways 
to engage and cross‑skill or upskill 
individuals in emerging technologies 
and skills that are in demand or may 
potentially come in demand given the 
evolving business models and customer 
needs. Company understands the 
needs of newer generation and strives 
to offer a work culture that excites 
and provides greater autonomy and 
empowerment. For more details, 
please read ‘Unlocking our People 
Value’ in Management’s Discussion and 
Analysis Report.
Positive as a broader 
talent pool can be 
tapped. Negative owing 
to increase in choices 
available to an individual 
in the market.

Cyber Security 
and Privacy 
incidents
Risk, 
Opportunity
After pandemic, all industries 
and markets were forced to 
adopt and allow their workforce 
to work remotely, which expose 
the Company, its network and 
systems, to the risk of cyber 
security threats.
Company continues to maintain 
systems processes that reduce the 
probability of a threat occurring 
by applying Zero Trust Security 
framework. We have been attested 
to ISO 27001 by an independent firm 
and are compliant with SSAE 18 SOC 
1 and SOC 2. These systems and 
processes are monitored internally and 
externally and benchmarked against 
best industry practices. As per the 
General Data Protection Regulation, 
its not mandatory to appoint a Data 
Protection Officer (DPO) for our size 
of business, however, Company still 
appointed a DPO in 2020 itself to 
ensure data privacy remains our key 
priority. Company is conscious of its 
obligations both as a controller and 
processor of data.
Positive implications as 
strong cyber security 
and privacy framework 
instils confidence/ trust 
in our clients. Negative 
implications in case of an 
unauthorized breach.

Energy and 
emissions 
management
Risk, 
Opportunity
1. Energy consumption often 
represents a significant portion 
of operational expenses.
2. Governments worldwide 
are implementing stricter 
regulations to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions and 
combat climate change.
3. Consumers, investors, and 
other stakeholders increasingly 
prioritize sustainability. Our 
organization should be able to 
demonstrate a commitment 
to reducing our carbon 
footprint and environmental 
impact which can enhance our 
reputation, attract customers, 
and access capital more easily.
4. Dependence on fossil fuels 
exposes the business to risks 
associated with price volatility, 
supply disruptions, and 
regulatory changes.
5. As a business, we are also 
under pressure to assess and 
improve the environmental 
performance of our suppliers, 
as well as collaborate with 
them to achieve sustainability 
goals.
6. Proactively addressing energy 
and emissions management will 
place us in a better position to 
remain competitive in a rapidly 
changing market.
7. Climate change poses 
significant long-term risks 
to the business, including 
physical risks from extreme 
weather events and transition 
risks associated with shifting 
regulatory frameworks and 
market preferences.
Effective management of energy 
usage can lead to cost savings 
through efficiency improvements 
and the adoption of renewable 
energy sources. We are in process 
of transitioning to renewable energy 
sources and implementing energy-
efficient technologies. Our business is 
constantly aware to remain complied 
with all applicable regulations to avoid 
penalties and maintain our social 
license to operate. One of the goals 
is to reduce our carbon footprint 
and environmental impact from our 
operations. We have adopted different 
targets to be able to bring in net-
zero, carbon reduction compliance in 
next few years. We also collaborate 
with our suppliers to make them 
aware of our sustainability standards 
and goals to achieve the results 
in a collaborative way. As a part 
of our services and offerings, we 
have also taken up the initiative to 
offer sustainability related software 
implementations which will allow 
our customers to adapt and comply 
with sustainable practices for their 
organization.
Positive implications if 
we are able to meet our 
carbon reduction and 
net-zero targets as it 
will drive us towards the 
sustainable practices for 
long-term savings.

Statement by director responsible for the 
Business Responsibility Report, highlighting 
ESG related challenges, targets and 
achievements (Listed entity has flexibility 
regarding the placement of this disclosure)
For over 42 years, Mastek has been at the forefront in providing technology 
solutions to address complex public system challenges. During this time, Mastek has 
consistently delivered substantial value to its shareholders while dedicating a portion 
of its profits to societal betterment. Whether addressing customer needs, supporting 
its employees, or engaging with third parties and the supply chain, sustainability has 
always been a fundamental consideration in Mastek’s decision-making process.
In FY24, Mastek added 7 more goals to its Sustainability Framework, aligned with 
12 of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals: No Poverty (SDG 1), Zero 
Hunger (SDG 2), Good Health and Well-Being (SDG 3), Quality Education (SDG 4), 
Gender Equality (SDG 5), Clean Water and Sanitation (SDG 6), Affordable and Clean 
Energy (SDG 7), Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG 8), Reduced Inequalities 
(SDG 10), Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG 11), Responsible Consumption and 
Production (SDG 12), and Climate Action (SDG 13).
Since its listing in 1982, Mastek has been distinguished by board independence, 
governance, ethical business practices, and shareholder transparency. The Company 
has maintained a record of zero data breaches and consistently creates high 
shareholder value. Additionally, Mastek’s subsidiary boards are empowered and 
include local independent directors. Mastek’s commitment to social responsibility 
is embodied in the Mastek Foundation, established over two decades ago with the 
guiding principle of “Informed Giving, Responsible Receiving.” Founded in 2002, 
a decade before the term CSR was widely recognized, the Mastek Foundation has 
made significant strides in social impact. In FY24 alone, the foundation has touched 
the lives of 133,060 beneficiaries, supported 250 animals and birds, and partnered 
with 16 charities across five states in India through various projects. A notable 
initiative among others is the “Gratitude Is Attitude” event, where employees have 
the opportunity to volunteer with and contribute to charities that support various 
causes. Under Social Value in the UK, Mastek supports a number of bootcamps, 
multiple events for disadvantaged individuals to help them in various ways, including 
a CV workshop, recruitment, or a discovery day at the offices. Carbon Net-Zero 
Emissions assessment and benchmarking were undertaken for the UK office. Mastek 
is committed to being Net Zero by 2035 in the UK and is already offsetting 100% of 
carbon emissions in the UK as of December 2023.
Mastek is dedicated to reducing waste and optimizing water and energy use as part of 
its environmental responsibility. Its offices in India are accredited with ISO 14001 and 
ISO 45001. Significant reductions have been achieved in electricity consumption, total 
GHG emissions, and water usage. Mastek continues to enhance its environmental 
initiatives and engage employees through its partnership with One Tree Planted, 
the official partner of the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration. In 
January 2024, Mastek registered as a participating company under the United Nations 
Global Compact, committing to its Ten Principles covering Human Rights, Labor, 
Environment, and Anti-Corruption.
