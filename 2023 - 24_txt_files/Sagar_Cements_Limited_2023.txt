materialise its vision of scaling up the recycling of 
its materials and maximising circularity including 
across the value chain.
Sagar Cements Limited (SGC) is committed to adhering to 
environmentally friendly and sustainable operations by practicing

emission of GHG. The Company is investing heavily in using waste 
from operations to convert into energy and reduce the emissions.

Eﬄuent
Management
Opportunity
Water shortage and availability can hamper 
operations and business continuity. Because of 
stringent norms related to water discharge, water 
treatment cost is bound to increase manifold.

waste and also recycling and reuse of waste water.

Global regulation
on curbing Green
House Gases
Emission
Risk
Limestone is the main input for cement 
manufacturing and requires fossil fuel for burning
the limestone. This process releases CO2 during 
calcination of limestone and combustion of fuel. 
This could contribute to global warming and 
impact business continuity and/or disruption.
To mitigate the risk, the Company has set voluntary targets to reduce 
emissions. The Company is taking initiatives such as energy transition 
to renewables, increasing the waste heat recovery systems, increase in 
green product portfolio and use of alternative fuels and raw materials. 
The Company is also exploring innovative technologies to reduce 
the emissions
