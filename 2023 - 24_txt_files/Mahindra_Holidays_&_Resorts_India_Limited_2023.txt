Internal Conﬂict of Interest Management
 
 Code of Conduct and Ethics: MHRIL has a well-deﬁned Code of Conduct and Ethics for its Board members and senior 
management. This code outlines the ethical standards and behaviors expected from them, including the need to avoid any 
situation that might lead to a conﬂict of interest. Board members are required to disclose any personal interest that might 
conﬂict with the interests of the Company.
 
Disclosure Requirements: Board members must disclose any material, ﬁnancial or personal interest in matters that are 
brought before the Board. These disclosures are recorded and maintained to ensure transparency. Members must abstain 
from participating in discussions and voting on any matter in which they have a conﬂict of interest.
 
Board Evaluation and Monitoring: Regular evaluations of Board members are conducted to assess their adherence to 
the Code of Conduct. This evaluation includes monitoring potential conﬂict of interest and ensuring that any issues are 
addressed promptly and effectively.
 
Training and Awareness Programs: MHRIL conducts regular training and awareness programs for its Board members 
and senior management on corporate governance, ethical standards and conﬂict of interest management. This ensures 
that all members are well-informed about the company’s policies and procedures.
 
Conﬂict of Interest with Related Parties
 
Related Party Transactions Policy: MHRIL has a comprehensive policy for handling related party transactions. This policy 
ensures that any transactions with related parties are conducted on an arm's length basis and are in the best interest of the 
Company. All related party transactions are subject to prior approval from the Audit Committee and the Board.
 
Independent Directors: The presence of Independent Directors on the Board helps mitigate conﬂict of interest. These 
Directors provide an unbiased perspective and ensure that decisions are made in the best interest of the Company and its 
stakeholders.
 
Audit Committee Oversight: The Audit Committee plays a crucial role in overseeing related party transactions and 
ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. The Committee reviews and approves all signiﬁcant related party 
transactions, ensuring transparency and fairness.
 
Regular Audits and Reviews: MHRIL conducts regular internal and external audits to review related party transactions 
and conﬂict of interest management practices. These audits help identify any potential issues and recommend corrective 
actions.
 
By implementing these processes and policies, MHRIL effectively manages and avoids conﬂict of interest, ensuring that the 
Board operates with the highest levels of integrity and in the best interests of the Company and its stakeholders.

MHRIL engages in the development, construction and operation of resort properties, so there is no packaging involved in 
delivering its services.
 
Waste generated during the construction phase is managed according to the Environmental Management Plan ("EMP"), 
emphasizing reuse, recycling and safe disposal by government-authorized waste handlers and recyclers. This process 
includes material suppliers taking back packaging materials such as cardboard, foam and plastic, which are then recycled 
through authorized vendors, ensuring circularity in the construction value chain.
 
During the operation and maintenance phase, MHRIL monitors and measures the waste produced and ensures its safe 
disposal through government-authorized waste handlers and recyclers, maintaining circularity within the eco-value chain.

MHRIL has an Ethics Helpline to provide a third-party enabled grievance redressal 
mechanism for employees. It has partnered with a third-party service provider to 
offer a secure and conﬁdential platform to report issues related to Code of Conduct 
violations. Any unethical behavior or violations can be reported.
MHRIL also conducts skip-level meetings to seek additional insight into the workings 
of the organization by providing an open and non-threatening environment where 
employees can register their honest and sincere feedback / grievance. In a skip-level 
meeting, the leader bypasses ﬁrst-level management and speaks directly to second-
level managerial employees, or lower employees. The primary purpose of the skip-
level meeting is to determine the organization's effectiveness, by getting an honest 
assessment from employees at all levels. These skip level meetings are recorded for 
further enhancement.
We are Listening:
MHRIL also has a WhatsApp number which is monitored by the CHRO. Employees 
are encouraged to reach out to the Company with ideas, suggestions, thoughts, 
queries and concerns. The CHRO shares messages with the appropriate stakeholders 
depending on the nature of the message. This initiative enables employees to share 
creative ideas, feedback, suggestions, regular enquiries, testimonials or just an 
appreciation for something. Posters displaying intent and construct of this program 
are displayed across branches, resorts and corporate.

10.  Health and safety management system:
 
a. 
Whether an occupational health and safety 
management system has been implemented by 
the entity? (Yes / No). 
 
 
Yes, MHRIL has implemented The Mahindra Safety 
Way ("TMSW") for managing workplace health 
and safety in accordance with the Mahindra 
Group's safety management framework. We 
have a clear policy and set of procedures for 
Occupational Health and Safety Management 
Systems ("OHSMS") to ensure the safety and 
well-being of all employees, members and visitors. 
The Company has always prioritized health and 
safety in all its resorts, offices and workplaces. 
One of our resorts located in Puducherry has 
the certiﬁcation for ISO 45001:2018. MHRIL 
has highlighted the Business Risk Management 
framework as a crucial stage in the development of 
a solid safety management system. This framework 
includes a series of processes for continuous risk 
detection, assessment and mitigation, with active 
employee participation at each of its managed 
resorts. In this context, resort methods include 
hazard identiﬁcation, recommendation systems, 
daily brieﬁngs and employee participation in 
periodic resort safety Committee meetings. In 
addition, all MHRIL-managed resorts undertake 
periodic operational and corporate OHSMS audits 
to ensure compliance with industry standards.
 
 
The establishment of a resort-speciﬁc safety 
committee and the monthly discussion of 
potential areas for improvement further enhances 
the OHSMS implementation. Annual events such 
as Mock Fire Drills, National Safety Month and 
Road Safety Awareness Programs are held at each 
resort. To strengthen its safety procedures, the 
Company continues to focus on theme-based 
safety subjects, such as behavior-based safety 
("BBS") Level 2. These approaches have signiﬁcantly 
improved workplace safety and reduce likelihood 
of potential injuries, while enhancing the overall 
safety culture of the organization. In order to keep 
its safety rules and procedures effective and up to 
date, the organization conducts frequent reviews 
and revisions.
 
 
If yes, the coverage of such system? 
 
 
In our managed resorts, we have implemented 
our safety management system, which is designed 
to detect and reduce risk, establish workplace 
safety standards, offer engagement opportunities 
for resort employees, provide pertinent safety 
training and meet legal requirements. MHRIL has 
developed a fundamental safety management 
system and risk management best practices to 
promote a secure work environment. They include, 
but are not limited to, hazard communication, 
FSSAI-compliant 
food 
safety 
and 
hygiene 
standards, safety training, accident reporting 
and investigation, hazard identiﬁcation and 
control procedures, chemical safety and clearly 
deﬁned managerial responsibilities and employee 
expectations. MHRIL works to guarantee that all 
of the resorts it operates adhere to OHS standards 
that exceed all applicable laws, regulations, 
standards and codes. Both internal Mahindra 
Group company standards and industry-wide 
best practices are compared to these standards. 
In order to certify compliance with TMSW process 
standards, all MHRIL resorts undergo periodic 
corporate and business occupational health and 
safety audits. Several Mahindra Rise awards and 
external certiﬁcations, such as ISO 22000:2018 
acknowledge MHRIL's commitment and efforts 
to ensure a safe and healthy workplace for all 
employees and its members.
 
 
The OHSMS applies to all employees, contractors, 
visitors and club members, as well as any other 
stakeholders whose activities may be affected 
Mahindra Holidays & Resorts India Limited
102
Annual Report 2023–2024
by the organization's operations. The OHSMS 
includes identifying and assessing potential 
workplace hazards and risks, adopting appropriate 
controls and procedures to eliminate or minimize 
these risks and monitoring and reviewing the 
effectiveness of these controls over time. In 
addition, the OHSMS comprises incident reporting 
using a digital mobile app called as i2i App and 
investigation, emergency response planning, 
personnel training and awareness initiatives and 
ongoing improvement of the OHSMS.
 
b. 
What are the processes used to identify work-
related hazards and assess risks on a routine 
and non-routine basis by the entity?
 
 
As a part of OHSMS, MHRIL has a well-deﬁned 
documented procedure Safe operating Procedure 
and Risk Assessment ("SOPRA") to carry out 
assessment of work-related hazards and risks for 
all routine and non-routine activities carried out 
at any location within the premises. Hazard and 
risk identiﬁcation is carried out by the process 
owners in consultation with the safety experts. 
Every resort develops a risk register based on this 
assessment.  The process owners are responsible 
to ensure adequate controls are identiﬁed and 
implemented to control the identiﬁed OHS risks.
 
 
Every SOPRA document is prepared by teams 
who are well qualiﬁed and competent for ongoing 
activities on ground. The SOPRA is updated based 
on learnings from good practices, incidents & 
accidents across resorts. Every staff member 
has the freedom to stop anyone if unsafe act is 
observed on the resort. This right to refuse or 
stop unsafe or unhealthy work is communicated 
through the safety brieﬁngs. We have well-deﬁned 
Standard Operating Procedures ("SOPs") for 
reporting, investigating and analyzing incidents. 
 
 
Some of the mitigation measures to prevent or 
mitigate signiﬁcant occupational health & safety 
impacts include, utilize several processes to 
identify work-related hazards and assess risks 
on both routine and non-routine bases. These 
processes are essential in maintaining a safe and 
healthy work environment for our employees. 
Here are the key methods we employ:
 
 
Some of the mitigation measures to prevent or 
mitigate signiﬁcant occupational health & safety 
impacts includes:
 
 
(i)  
Provision and maintenance of ﬁre detection, 
alarm and suppression systems;
 
 
(ii)  
Regular site review, inspections and audits 
to assess safety preparedness;
 
 
(iii)  Regular mock drills for ﬁre as well as medical 
emergencies;
 
 
(iv)  Wherever applicable, Provision of PPE, Work 
Permit, Lock out and Tag Out ("LOTO") and 
other administrative controls; 
 
 
(v)  
Electrical circuits of all the Rooms are 
protected by Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker 
("ELCB") and proper grounding, insulation of 
all equipment is ensured; 
 
 
(vi)  Regular training on occupational health & 
safety training to sensitize employees on 
OHS aspects to inculcate a culture of safety; 
and
 
 
(vii)  Employee 
engagement 
campaigns 
on 
health & safety topics such as ﬁre safety, 
road safety, emergency evacuation and 
food safety among others.
 
 
MHRIL resort locations are subject to safety 
inspections and reviews periodically by internal 
health & safety team with the perspective of 
checking any health, hygiene and safety hazards 
and mitigating them. As a part of ISO 22000:2018 
certiﬁcation MHRIL resort locations undergo a site 
review and assessment to check deployment of 
operational controls. 
 
 
There are several processes that are applied in 
MHRIL to identify work-related hazards and assess 
risks on a routine and non-routine basis. Here are 
some of them:
 
 
Workplace inspections: Regular inspections 
of the workplace help identify potential hazards 
and risks. Inspections are conducted by trained 
personnel who are familiar with the workplace 
and its operations.
 
 
Job hazard analysis ("JHA") & Risk Assessments: 
JHA involves breaking down a job into its 
component tasks and identifying potential hazards 
associated with each task. This helps to identify 
hazards that may not be apparent during a general 
workplace inspection. MHRIL followed a well-
deﬁned & MHRIL customized SOPRA procedure 
framework derived from Hazard Identiﬁcation 
and Risk Assessment ("HIRA") process as deﬁned 
by under Mahindra TMSW framework.
 
 
Incident investigation: Incidents such as ﬁrst 
aid cases, near-misses and occupational illness 
provides valuable information about hazards and 
risks in the workplace. Investigating incidents 
helps to identify the root causes of the incident 
and any underlying hazards that may have 
contributed to it.
 
 
Safety audits: Safety audits are a systematic 
review of an organization's safety management 
system. They help to identify gaps and weaknesses 
in the system that may be contributing to hazards 
and risks in the workplace. MHRIL has appointed 
expert third party organizations such as Bureau 
Veritas, National safety Council for risk speciﬁc 
resort audits. 
Annual Report 2023–2024
103
 
 
Consultation with colleagues: Resort staff 
are often the best source of information about 
hazards and risks in the workplace. Consulting 
with staff helps to identify hazards that may be 
overlooked by others and can also help to build 
a safety culture within the organization. In our 
i2i app anyone can report unsafe conditions, 
unsafe behaviors identiﬁed and actions taken for 
addressing those observations. 
 
 
It is important to note that these processes are 
used in combination and are tailored to the 
speciﬁc needs and risks of the organization. 
Regular and ongoing hazard identiﬁcation and 
risk assessment are essential to maintaining 
a safe and healthy workplace. We conduct 
in-depth analysis of any incidents that may occur 
at our sites, with learnings being communicated 
throughout resorts using existing mechanisms 
(safety alerts) for sharing information. This is done 
as an effort to ensuring that similar incidents do 
not repeat. The overall outcome of the efforts are 
zero reportable accidents, drop in ﬁrst aid cases 
and suitable awareness among operatives at all 
levels paving the way for good safety culture in 
the organization.

As per the M&M CSC office ﬁre safety guidelines and 
self-assessment, a detailed review of the registered 
and branch offices was carried out to ensure that those 
offices meet the mandatory ﬁre safety standards as per 
the recommendations.  
 
In view of improving the near miss reporting, reporting 
of unsafe conditions and acts, as a proactive measure 
for safety culture, MHRIL has introduced safety reporting 
in its Making Magical app, a mobile digital application-
based reporting. This reporting tool is available with all 
MHRIL employees across resorts and offices to report 
near miss and other incidents. It also has a provision 
for raising a notiﬁcation to the leadership, CRO for any 
serious incident or accident reported from the app. 
This has helped to improve the near miss reporting 
from the resorts and proactively performing resort level 
corrective actions to avoid the incident or to reduce the 
potential risk.
 
Other safety initiatives are based on the Risk 
Management Committee's and the Corporate Safety 
Committee's recommendations. We initiated those 
efforts to proactively evaluate potential risks and 
mitigate potential safety concerns.
 
1. 
Electrical 
Safety 
Assessments: 
We 
have 
appointed an electrical safety expert consultant to 
conduct an annual electrical audit in the resorts, 
identify areas for improvement and suggest 
remedial actions. We have taken this proactive 
step to safeguard our resorts from potential 
electrical risks and safety concerns.
 
2. 
Adventure sport audits: Based on our internal 
assessments, we have identiﬁed twelve vendors 
who are providing rope course and soft adventure 
services in the resorts. We subjected these vendors 
to an independent, third-party safety assessment. 
We had appointed the National Safety Council 
and Bureau Veritas to conduct a safety survey and 
assessment of these setups, as well as provide 
recommendations for improving the safety of 
adventure sports activities. We have pursued 
vendors to implement these recommended 
actions to further enhance the safety level of 
these soft adventure activities. An independent 
authority or structural expert is assessing all new 
adventure sports venues for structural stability 
and participant safety.
 
3. 
Structural 
stability 
audits: 
We 
conducted 
a structural stability audit of certain resort 
premises as a proactive step to identify structural 
improvement areas and conduct a conditional 
assessment of these resorts by a competent

LEADERSHIP INDICATORS 
1.  
Provide the processes for consultation between 
stakeholders 
and 
the 
Board 
on 
economic, 
environmental and social topics or if consultation is 
delegated, how is feedback from such consultations 
provided to the Board.
 
We consistently and proactively engage with our key 
stakeholders to effectively communicate our strategy 
and performance. Through ongoing communication 
and engagement, we ensure that expectations are 
aligned. The Board is regularly informed about various 
developments and their feedback is actively sought.
2. 
Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support 
the identiﬁcation and management of environmental 
and social topics (Yes / No).
 
Yes.
 
If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs 
received from stakeholders on these topics were 
incorporated into policies and activities of the entity. 
 
Yes, stakeholder consultations assist in identifying and 
managing environmental and social aspects. MHRIL, in 
collaboration with IGBC, Climate Group and SBTi, has 
committed to decarbonizing its resort operations and 
engaging related stakeholders. MHRIL's priority actions, 
aligned with Net Zero goals, includes designing Net Zero 
buildings, adopting science-based Net Zero targets, 
improving operational efficiency, mainstreaming low-
carbon materials, developing climate-aligned building 
codes and standards and enabling performance 
monitoring of Net Zero buildings. These commitments 
enhance our efforts to integrate sustainability into our 
value chain.
 
Our Green Supply Chain Management ("GSCM") policy, 
commitment to SBTi, Carbon Neutrality and develop-
ment of Net Zero buildings align with our business charter 
commitments. For instance, stakeholder consultation 
led to MHRIL becoming a founding member of IGBC 
to build cleaner and greener resorts. Collaboration 
with the Indo-Swiss Building Energy Efficiency Project 
("BEEP") has helped mainstream energy-efficient and 
thermally comfortable building designs for residential 
and commercial buildings, strengthening our Climate 
Responsive Design ("CRD") speciﬁcations and energy 
demand reduction. Biodiversity preservation under 
the guidance of IBBI (Indian Business and Biodiversity 
Initiative) ensures eco-balanced resorts.
 
Regular consultations with contractors and suppliers 
have highlighted the need to support each other in 
integrating ESG aspects across the value chain. This 
process culminated in the creation of a Code of Conduct 
for our Suppliers and Contractors. Thus, stakeholder 
consultation has signiﬁcantly helped MHRIL integrate 
sustainability and build a strong ESG foundation across 
the value chain.
3.  
Provide details of instances of engagement with, and 
actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable 
/ marginalized stakeholder groups. 
 
The Company focuses on creating long-term beneﬁts 
to the society through various CSR initiatives by 
identifying disadvantaged / underprivileged sections of 
the demography residing in the peripheral areas of the 
Company by conducting on-ground need assessments 
from time to time. The Corporate Social Responsibility 
(“CSR”) Policy of the Company makes it a point to 
focus attention on the disadvantaged segments of 
the society and directs CSR efforts to uplift them. The 
Company’s social development projects are aimed at 
empowering the underprivileged sections of the society 
such as children, women, youth, etc. The programmes 
implemented are aimed at improving living standards 
of the community and generating employment and 
livelihood opportunities. The Company addresses the 
concerns of vulnerable / marginalised stakeholder 
groups by rolling out interventions in the areas of –

Brieﬂy describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by 
your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices 
adopted to manage such wastes.
 
We recognize the importance of using alternative construction materials to reduce reliance on virgin resources, thereby 
decreasing our environmental footprint related to energy consumption, pollution and waste disposal. To mitigate 
the impact of these materials, we have integrated circularity principles into our operations and aligned our material 
procurement strategy with Green Supply Chain Management.
 
MHRIL employs innovative techniques to manage waste generated during the design, construction and occupancy stages 
of a project. We minimize waste production by reusing, recycling and ensuring safe disposal at designated sites. As part of 
our commitment to sustainability, all our projects are 100% green-certiﬁed, and we develop detailed waste management 
plans from the design stage through the construction and use phases. These plans are meticulously executed on-site.
 
Our resorts feature 100% on-site composting of organic waste and treatment of recyclables and other waste through 
partnerships with authorized vendors. Each project includes a resource recovery center ("RRC") for secondary waste 
segregation, adding value by deriving resources from waste. During construction, most construction and demolition 
waste, such as waste blocks and tiles, is repurposed within the project, for example, in roof tiling and kitchen block work, 
which reduces landﬁll diversion and costs. Scrap materials like steel, iron and aluminum are sold to authorized handlers for 
recycling.
 
Our primary goal is to avoid wastage and reuse materials through innovative interventions. We have on-site composting 
and organic waste treatment mechanisms, such as utilizing food waste in biogas plants at various resorts. We have also 
eliminated single-use plastic in our resorts. All other waste is recycled with the help of authorized vendors and our waste 
data is reported on the GRI portal with third-party audits to ensure zero waste to landﬁll. MHRIL is committed to having all 
resorts certiﬁed as Zero Waste to landﬁll by FY 2025.

MHRIL has resorts across 11 Indian states. None of the projects are in ecologically sensitive areas. Our land selection 
process ensures screening out of areas near ecologically sensitive zones. 
 
We do undertake environmental clearances for our projects aligned with the regulatory requirements. Though none of 
our projects are in sensitive zones, we do undertake biodiversity studies through external partners for projects rich in 
biodiversity and conserve the natural ecosystem (during construction too through our sustainable construction practices 
and regular biodiversity assessment for such areas). In FY 2024, we did a biodiversity study for our Treehouse Resort, 
Kensvile and Netrang, and conservation of the same is part of our customer value proposition which will be maintained 
through our sustainable construction practices and design interventions.

MHRIL's operations in ecologically sensitive areas can have both direct and indirect impacts on biodiversity. Direct impacts 
may include habitat destruction, fragmentation and disturbance due to construction activities or resource extraction. 
Indirect impacts could stem from increased human activity leading to pollution, invasive species introduction, or altered 
ecological dynamics.
 
To mitigate these impacts, MHRIL implements various prevention and remediation measures. This includes conducting 
thorough environmental impact assessments before initiating projects to minimize disruption to habitats. Additionally, 
they employ sustainable construction practices, such as using eco-friendly materials and minimizing land clearing.
 
MHRIL also actively engages in biodiversity conservation efforts, including habitat restoration and protection initiatives 
within and around their properties. They collaborate with local communities and conservation organizations to implement 
biodiversity monitoring programs and undertake measures to restore degraded ecosystems.
 
Through these proactive measures, MHRIL aims to minimize its ecological footprint in sensitive areas while contributing

This allows the brand to align with the evolving needs 
of consumers. Additionally, the Company periodically 
conducts Brand Track studies with customers to 
measure the efficiency, effectiveness and awareness of 
our brand campaigns. At the resort level, we conduct 
a comprehensive Post-Holiday Feedback Survey, which 
includes Net Promoter Score ("NPS") and Customer 
Satisfaction ("CSAT") surveys, after members check 
out. This survey captures the overall experience 
from check-in to check-out, covering aspects such 
as accommodations, dining experiences and unique 
offerings at the Happy Hub and Spa.
