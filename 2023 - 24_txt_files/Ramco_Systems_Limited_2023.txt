(Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) is the practice of companies disclosing information about their 
environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance. It goes beyond financial reporting to provide stakeholders with a 
comprehensive view of a Company’s non-financial impacts and contributions to sustainable development. BRSR covers topics 
such as environmental impact, social responsibility and governance practices, aiming to promote transparency and accountability.

1.
Energy 
Management
Risk
Even if they are not directly 
producing items, the software 
and IT industries require energy 
to operate their equipment and 
facilities. As a result, a Company’s 
decisions regarding how much 
energy it consumes and where it 
originates from can influence how 
well it works and how dangerous 
its operations are.
At Ramco, we focus on 
energy efficiency and the 
transition to renewable 
energy sources. This 
not only reduces carbon 
emissions 
but 
also 
lowers our operational 
costs. It’s all part of our 
aim to become carbon 
neutral, 
and 
we’re 
taking deliberate steps 
to minimize both our 
total and specific energy 
consumption.

(Indicate positive

 2.
Climate 
Change
Risk
Climate change events, such 
as rising sea levels and harsher 
storms, pose physical hazards. 
They also introduce transitional 
issues, such as the need for 
additional 
renewable 
energy. 
These developments have the 
potential to have an impact on 
enterprises. Hence, it’s critical to 
identify and mitigate these risks.
Ramco 
aims 
to 
achieve Net Zero and 
develop 
technology-
driven 
solutions 
to 
help 
our 
customers 
address climate-related 
concerns.
Negative
 3.
Diversity, 
Equity and 
Inclusion
Opportunity
When a Company’s workforce 
is 
diverse 
and 
inclusive, 
it 
demonstrates 
that 
employees 
are 
respected 
and 
treated 
properly. 
Furthermore, 
having 
more 
diversity 
and 
inclusion 
allows businesses to advocate 
for marginalized groups, resulting 
in a positive reputation in the 
community.
-
Positive
 4.
Human Rights
Risk
Companies 
that 
embrace 
human rights demonstrate their 
commitment to developing long-
term, constructive connections 
with everyone affected by their 
operations, including consumers, 
communities, 
employees, 
and 
investors. This means they care 
about the individuals they interact 
with and strive for mutual benefit.
Ramco has a robust 
Human
Capital
Management 
(HCM) 
tool to enhance their HR 
procedures. This tool 
facilitates more effective 
competency 
planning 
and staffing.
Negative
 5.
Digital Talent 
Empowerment
Opportunity
Empowering digital talent at work 
is vital because it provides people 
with new skills and chances to 
participate effectively, resulting 
in increased engagement and 
performance.
-
Positive
6.
Talent 
Acquisition, 
Development 
& Retention
Risk
A 
Company’s 
high 
worker 
retention rates indicate that its 
rules and practices are effective. 
In contrast, a high attrition rate 
implies low employee satisfaction, 
which may concern investors. 
Taking care of employee well-
being can enhance morale while 
lowering the costs of hiring and 
training new employees.
Ramco’s 
fundamental 
goal is to create a 
motivated workforce that 
will improve corporate 
performance. We rely on 
talented people to meet 
client needs, maintain 
business sustainability, 
and drive future growth.

Employee 
reskilling 
enables 
businesses 
to 
stay

with 
changing 
technological 
needs 
and continue growth. It produces 
a workforce that is adaptable, fast 
to learn, and ready to take on new 
duties as required by the firm.
-
Positive
8.
Customer 
Relations
Risk
Customer satisfaction is critical 
to business success because it 
indicates how well a Company 
meets 
or 
exceeds 
customer 
expectations. 
A 
negative 
customer experience can cost a 
firm a customer and damage its 
reputation, resulting in reduced 
sales and revenue.
Our 
success 
is 
dependent
on
establishing trust with 
clients. Ramco works 
year-round to develop 
customer relationships. 
We 
have 
dedicated 
customer 
service
and quality teams to 
provide 
the 
highest 
possible level of client 
satisfaction.
Negative
9.
Risk 
Management
Risk
To stay ahead in a fast-moving 
market, we must be prepared 
to face unforeseen obstacles. 
Inefficient 
risk 
management 
practices could often result in 
fines from regulators, lost revenue 
from loss of customers, increased 
cost due to higher employee 
turnover, or lower stock values 
from a damaged reputation.
By 
implementing 
a 
robust
enterprise
risk
management
strategy, we manage 
both 
financial 
and 
non-financial 
risks 
while maintaining our 
competitive advantage 
in the market.
Negative
10.
Business 
Ethics and 
Compliance
Risk
An area of concern in corporate 
ethics is how issues such as fraud, 
executive misconduct, unethical 
practices, money laundering, and 
antitrust violations are handled by 
organizations. Ethics infractions 
can result in police investigations, 
large 
fines, 
settlements, 
and 
reputational damage.
Compliance 
with 
the 
laws of the respective 
country and areas in 
which we operate are 
critical 
to 
protecting 
business interest.
Negative
11.
Data Privacy 
and Security
Risk
Companies are evaluated based 
on 
extent 
of 
personal 
data 
collected, their compliance with 
privacy regulations, the risk of 
data breaches, and the measures 
to protect data. 
Ramco 
uses 
data 
protection practices to 
keep 
customer 
data 
safe. Ramco has an ISO 
27001 certified process 
in place.

Corporate 
Governance
Risk
Companies are evaluated on 
important 
governance 
metrics 
such 
as 
ownership, 
Board 
compensation, 
accounting, 
ethics, and tax transparency. This 
examination also investigates how 
Company governance and ethical 
policies affect shareholders and 
other investors.
Ramco 
Systems 
has 
strong 
corporate
governance 
measures 
to reduce reputational 
and legal concerns. This 
aligns the Company’s 
interests with those of 
its stakeholders, which 
contributes to our long-
