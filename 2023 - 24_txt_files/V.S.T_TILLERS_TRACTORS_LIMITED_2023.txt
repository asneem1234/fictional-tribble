1.
GHG and 
Climate 
Change
R
VST majorly rely on non-
renewable fuel and energy 
sources which result in GHG 
emissions. Also climate change 
poses 
various 
emerging 
risk for VST business. These 
include 
transitional 
risk 
such 
as 
business 
impact 
due to reduced agricultural 
productivity due to shifting 
weather patterns, increased 
operational 
costs 
from 
extreme weather events, and 
changing market demands. 
Regulatory changes may also 
necessitate modifications in 
design to meet emissions 
standards. Additional carbon 
taxes may require company to 
opt for clean energy solution 
in order to reduce cost. There 
are 
also 
growing 
physical
To 
achieve 
environmental 
excellence, business units have 
improved 
energy 
efficiency 
and 
increased 
renewable 
energy use. Measures include 
energy audits, LED street lights, 
Power Factor Panels, and solar 
power at Hosur, Malur, and 
Mysore plants. VST reduces 
greenhouse 
gas 
emissions 
from diesel and electricity, 
aiming to cut waste emissions 
and adopt green technology. 
Additionally, VST planted 346 
trees at Malur and 865 plants 
at Hosur to positively impact 
the environment.

risk like flash flood, seasonal 
water scarcity, and heat waves 
impacting operations. Reliance 
on 
non-renewable 
sources 
of fuel and energy can also 
impact the reputation and 
result in loss of business
2.
Waste 
Management
R
Waste generation can have 
a significant impact on the 
environment and our overall 
efficiency. 
VST 
during 
its 
operations 
generate 
non-
hazardous 
wastes 
like 
metal scrap from Machining 
and 
fabrication 
processes, 
packaging waste, and non-
hazardous waste like painting, 
and coating waste. These waste 
if not handled appropriately 
have a potential of detrimental 
impact on ecosystems and 
society. This can also result 
in 
non-compliance 
and 
reputational damages to the 
organization.
Our facilities have implemented 
waste management programs 
to 
adhere 
to 
regulations 
and boost recycling efforts. 
We partner with authorized 
suppliers for proper recycling or 
reuse after waste segregation. 
Future efforts will focus on 
minimizing waste generation 
rather than disposal. We are 
committed to reducing waste 
intensity 
and 
encouraging 
recycle and reuse of materials.
Negative
3.
Water 
Management
R
Water is an important resource 
for VST's operations and also 
a critical driving factor for its 
business. However, factors like 
droughts, extreme weather 
events, and increasing demand 
create water scarcity, impacting 
farmers, 
communities, 
and 
also VST's operations as few of 
our location are in water scare 
zones. Additionally, company's 
operation 
also 
generates 
hazardous water which require 
treatment before discharge. 
If non properly managed this 
can result in non-compliances.
We minimize freshwater use 
through optimization, touch 
sensors, 
awareness, 
and 
reuse. Rainwater is collected 
and reused, and all three 
Manufacturing 
facilities 
maintain 
a 
zero-discharge

and 
reused, 
with 
sludge 
managed 
by 
third-party 
vendors. Office and canteen 
wastewater is treated and 
recycled for gardening, with 
sludge used as fertilizer.

4.
Reducing 
Life Cycle 
Emission
O
Agriculture's contribution to 
greenhouse 
gas 
emissions 
is significant, accounting for 
roughly 
one-quarter. 
This 
necessitates a material focus 
on mitigation strategies.  VST 
can address this challenge 
through 
targeted 
actions 
contributing 
to 
reduction 
of life cycle emission of its 
products with initiatives such 
as improving fuel efficiency, 
reducing its own emission 
and 
energy 
consumption. 
By making investments in 
renewable energy solutions to 
power operations can further 
enhance 
energy 
efficiency. 
Other than positive impact 
on environment it will also 
help VST to attract climate 
conscious customer and build 
reputation
NA
Positive
5.
Sustainable 
Supply Chain
R
Supply chain contributes to a 
very critical element in VST's 
business operations. Hence 
sourcing efficiency are critical 
aspects 
of 
sustainability 
strategy. Failure to effectively 
monitor 
ESG 
risk 
within 
supply chain may lead to 
legal penalties, reputational 
damage, 
and 
consumer 
backlash from issues such 
as 
non-compliance 
with 
regulations, 
corruption, 
human rights violations, and 
environmental harm within the 
supply chain.  These risks also 
threaten, disrupt operations, 
and hinder long-term viability, 
highlighting 
the 
imperative 
for rigorous monitoring and 
proactive measures to uphold 
ethical 
standards, 
resulting 
from 
supply 
disruptions 
and fluctuating input costs.
The Company has implemented 
a Supplier Risk Management 
and 
Mitigation 
(SRMM) 
process 
to 
reduce 
supply 
chain vulnerabilities. Supplier 
development 
programs 
enhance 
supplier 
capacity, 
boosting 
transparency 
and 
operational efficiency. These 
strategies collectively mitigate 
supply 
chain 
risks 
and 
improve overall performance. 
The Company is also in the 
process for developing and 
implementing supplier code 
of conduct integrating ESG 
parameters in it.

Human 
Rights 
Management
R
VST operates from multiple 
plants. Non-standard practices 
toward Human rights and 
labor management may lead 
to forced labor, child labor, 
and unsafe working conditions, 
leading 
to 
physical 
and 
mental harm to employees. 
Additionally, failure to provide 
fair 
wages, 
reasonable 
working hours, and proper 
benefits 
can 
perpetuate 
socioeconomic inequality and 
contribute to social unrest. 
Such violations tarnish the 
Company's reputation, lead to 
legal repercussions, and erode 
trust 
among 
stakeholders, 
ultimately 
undermining 
organizational 
sustainability 
and ethical credibility.
The Company is committed 
to 
strengthening 
systems 
for 
implementing 
VST’s 
Sustainability 
Policies, 
particularly regarding human 
rights and labour practices. 
These 
policies 
ensure 
adherence to applicable laws 
and uphold human rights. 
Employees are responsible for 
maintaining the standards of 
honour and integrity outlined 
in 
the 
Code 
of 
Business 
Conduct, which they must 
review 
and 
integrate 
into 
their work and conduct. This 
approach 
mitigates 
risks 
related to human rights and 
labour practices.
Negative
7.
Occupational 
health & 
safety
R
From managing raw material 
to manufacturing, testing and 
dispatch, 
VST's 
operation 
exposes 
employees 
and 
worker to heavy load and 
precision 
operations. 
This 
may result in risk of health 
and safety risk for employee 
and workers. If not mitigated 
it may result in high impact on 
individual working in the field 
and shop floor. This can further 
result in reduced efficiency, 
burden of compliance.
The Company maintains a 
notice 
board 
detailing 
the 
required PPEs for specific tasks. 
Additionally, we offer non-
occupational health services, 
such as eye check-ups and 
blood tests, to employees. This 
approach ensures that safety 
and health standards are met, 
reduces risks and promotes 
overall employee and worker 
well-being.

9.
Product 
Quality and 
Safety
R
Instances of faulty or unsafe 
products can lead to accidents, 
injuries, or even fatalities for 
users or bystanders. Beyond 
the immediate human toll, 
such incidents can result in 
costly lawsuits, damage to the 
VST's reputation, and loss of 
consumer trust. Additionally, 
regulatory fines and penalties 
may be imposed, along with 
the 
expenses 
associated 
with 
product 
recalls 
and 
replacements. VST also does 
the white label manufacturing 
and lapse in quality can result 
in impact on third party brand 
as well.
Our 
product 
development 
and design process strictly 
adhere 
to 
our 
Product 
Safety regulations, ensuring 
that designs do not pose 
unreasonable risks to users 
or those nearby. We consider 
various 
factors, 
including 
individuals, 
environmental 
conditions, and interactions 
with other products, to enforce 
these regulations effectively. 
This 
approach 
underscores 
our commitment to mitigating 
risks and maintaining high 
standards of product quality 
and safety.

10. Product 
Stewardship 
and 
Innovation
O
Implementing robust product 
stewardship practices, such as 
sustainability focused design 
and innovation, the Company 
can enhance its reputation. 
Additionally, 
innovation 
in 
product design and technology 
can lead to more efficient, 
safer, 
and 
environmentally 
friendly 
tractors, 
improving 
customer 
satisfaction 
and 
market 
competitiveness. 
Furthermore, by staying ahead 
of 
regulatory 
requirements 
and consumer expectations, 
the Company can mitigate 
risks and seize new market 
opportunities, fostering long-
term 
growth 
and 
success

Ethics and 
Compliance
R
To ensure the organization 
fulfills 
its 
mission 
and 
maintains stakeholder trust, 
ethical conduct of business 
and compliance to law is 
important.  Failure to comply 
law and address critical issues 
like bribery and corruption 
risks 
can 
undermine 
this 
foundation, 
potentially 
leading to regulatory fines, 
legal 
repercussions, 
and 
reputational damage.  This, 
in turn, can erode customer 
confidence 
and 
decrease 
investor 
interest, 
ultimately 
impacting the sector's integrity 
and profitability.
VST is dedicated to maintaining 
the highest ethical standards, 
actively encouraging employees 
to report any concerns or 
potential violations of the Code 
of Conduct, policies, or laws 
without fear of retaliation. Our 
vigilant approach to business 
ethics 
is 
supported 
by 
a 
robust corporate governance 
framework, ensuring consistent 
adherence to evolving laws 
and regulations in a dynamic 
business environment.

Governance, leadership and oversight
	
Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, 
targets and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure). 
	
At VST, we recognize the need to align our operations with sustainable development principles, hence our commitment 
to the ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) framework.  
	
Our sustainability approach focuses on bringing positive environmental changes by identifying specific ESG parameters. 
We have made notable progress in water conservation, increasing renewable energy consumption, and managing 
hazardous waste effectively.  In renewable energy, we have installed solar panels at our Mysore, Malur, and Hosur 
plant locations, enabling us to meet a substantial part of our power requirements from renewable sources. Our water 
conservation efforts include recycling and reusing water within our facilities. Additionally, we have installed stacks to

reduce air pollution and created a green belt around our Malur plant. We have also addressed material ESG issues 
with potential financial implications by calculating emissions from energy consumption, allowing us to track, monitor, 
and aim to reduce our carbon footprint continuously. This year, we have also conducted assessment of our Scope 3 
emissions.
	
On the governance front, we maintain our commitment to transparent and ethical practices, as demonstrated by our 
recertification for QMS - ISO 9001:2015, EMS - ISO 14001:2015, and Safety - ISO 45001:2018. We believe that effective 
corporate governance is the foundation of a successful enterprise, and we are proud of our strong legacy in this area. 
	
Our social responsibility efforts focus on the wellbeing of our employees. We strive to foster an inclusive culture that 
encourages diversity and offers training and development opportunities. Ensuring the mental and physical health of 
our employees is a top priority, and we aim to maintain a safe workplace in accordance with the Factories Act. Our 
motto, “Zero Accident,” underscores this commitment.  
	
The publication of the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report is a testament to our robust corporate 
sustainability strategy, emphasizing environmental stewardship, social responsibility, and good governance. Our goal 
is to create a sustainable future for our company, stakeholders, and the communities we serve.  We appreciate your 
support in this endeavour and look forward to your active engagement as we continue to refine our sustainability 
strategy and strive to make a significant difference.

RSO or direct billing from the plant. On the same day, an inward PDI (Pre delivery inspection)  is conducted, and any 
shortages or defects found in the tractors are immediately reported to VST through a PDI job card. Complaints are 
registered through a job card, and a PCIR (Product Concern Intimation Report) is raised for the reported issues. Based 
on approvals, the dealer carries out the necessary work and closes the complaint.
