adopted in your establishments. Describe the 
strategy adopted by your company to reduce 
usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your 
products and processes and the practices 
adopted to manage such wastes.
 
 TTL does not manufacture anything and therefore 
does not use any hazardous or toxic chemicals in 
its processes. However, the company has adopted 
the below waste management practices to 
manage wastes:
 
● 
 Waste Segregation: Clearly labelled bins are 
provided to facilitate proper waste disposal.
 
● 
 Composting Initiative: Organic waste is locally 
converted into nutrient-rich compost.
 
● 
 Sewage Treatment Plant: Blackwater is treated 
on-site through a sewage treatment plant (STP), 
and the treated wastewater is reused for non-
potable purposes such as gardening, reducing 
freshwater demand.
 
● 
 Water Conservation: Measures such as aerators 
are implemented to reduce liquid waste volume.
 
● 
 Digitalization: Whenever possible, digital 
documents are preferred over paper, electronic 
communication is utilized, and documents are 
stored digitally to reduce paper waste and 
conserve resources.
 
● 
 Repair, Refurbish, Repurpose: Electronic 
items and wooden furniture are repaired or 
refurbished instead of discarded, and paper 
materials are reused when feasible (e.g., reusing 
envelopes).
 
● 
 Recycling: Waste materials, including IT 
equipment, electrical items, and bulbs, are 
disposed of through local recycling vendors.
 
● 
 Spill Response Plans: Spill response plans are 
in place for stored diesel for DG sets, outlining 
procedures for containing and cleaning up spills 
to prevent environmental contamination.
 
● 
 Reduction of Single-Use Plastics: Single-use 
plastic items are minimized, and reusable 
alternatives such as glass bottles and stainless-
steel utensils are utilized to decrease plastic 
waste generation.
 
● 
 Refillable Soap Dispensers: Refillable soap 
¡ÌÅµÌÈÌŉyÈŉÖÌŉ¡µŉYY5ŉºĂÌŉ¡µÌÒyŉºŉ
single-use plastic bottles, reducing plastic 
packaging waste.
 
● 
 Sanitary Waste Management: Separate bins 
ÌÅ¡Ăy®®èŉÌ¡µŉºÈŉÌyµ¡ÒyÈèŉâyÌÒŉ¡ÌÅºÌy®ŉ
are provided in bathrooms, clearly labelled to

● 
 Biomedical Waste Disposal: Specialized 
biomedical waste disposal services are engaged 
in medical facilities to manage biomedical waste 
in compliance with regulations.
