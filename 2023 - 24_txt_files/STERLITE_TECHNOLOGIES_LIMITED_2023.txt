associated with labour 
and human rights 
violations in their supply 
chains, such as forced 
labour, child labour, 
and unsafe working

comprehensive range of initiatives aimed at 
fostering sustainable practices and societal 
impact. These include commitments to 
sustainable sourcing and manufacturing, 
achieving net-zero emissions, ensuring water 
positivity across our global locations, and 
eliminating waste to landfills. Moreover, we 
prioritise product lifecycle assessments to 
minimise environmental footprints.

change, we recognize the importance of action 
throughout our value chain and within the 
communities we serve. Accordingly, we engage 
with partners both upstream and downstream 
to reduce packaging, waste, and address 
global challenges such as gender inequality, 
healthcare disparities, and digital education 
gaps. Furthermore, our focus extends to 
building world’s digital backbone - depicts how 
we are enabling nations to become a digital 
economy in the communities where we operate, 
underscoring our commitment to inclusivity and 
empowerment.
	
In conclusion, our commitment to ESG 
principles reflects our belief in their fundamental 
importance in navigating today’s dynamic 
landscape. With our expertise and unwavering 
dedication, we remain steadfast in our mission 
to create a greener, safer, and more inclusive

Yes, our commitment to upholding the highest ethical and business 
standards across our global operations is a cornerstone of our 
corporate ethos. This commitment, however, relies heavily on the 
collaboration and dedication of our stakeholders and employees.
Every member of our workforce is expected to adhere unwaveringly 
to our code of business conduct and ethics, ensuring that our 
principles are upheld at every level of our organisation.
To foster a culture of transparency and accountability, we have 
implemented a robust whistle-blower policy. This policy empowers not 
only our employees but also off-roll employees, workers, and business 
partners to voice concerns regarding any malpractice, impropriety, 
abuse, or misconduct at an early stage, without fear of reprisal 
or discrimination. Importantly, this policy has been extended to 
encompass external stakeholders, including vendors and customers, 
ensuring that all voices are heard and valued. Additionally, the toll 
free number and email ID that can be used for making a complaint are 
displayed in all offices.
Moreover, we have established a Prevention of Sexual Harassment 
Committee (PSHC) to oversee and address complaints effectively. Our 
commitment to creating a safe and respectful workplace is further 
underscored by annual training sessions provided to employees, 
equipping them with the knowledge and resources to identify and 
report instances of harassment through appropriate channels.
Recognizing the importance of holistic well-being, both mental 
and emotional, we launched STL Care in FY22. This initiative is 
dedicated to promoting the wellness of our employees, underscoring 
our commitment to fostering a supportive and nurturing work 
environment. Through STL Care, we provide resources and support 
mechanisms to prioritise the mental and emotional well-being of 
our workforce, ensuring that they feel valued and supported in their 
professional journeys.

implemented and upheld in accordance 
with our established procedures and 
legal mandates. Clear delineation of 
roles and responsibilities within the EHS 
team ensures effective oversight, with 
regular monitoring facilitated through 
comprehensive management reviews.
	
	
Furthermore, our unwavering commitment 
to excellence is underscored by the ISO 
45001 and 14001 certifications obtained 
by all our manufacturing facilities. These 
internationally recognized certifications 
serve as a testament to our dedication 
to ensuring the highest standards

our workforce through comprehensive risk 
assessment and management practices. 
Utilising our internal tool, we systematically 
evaluate risks associated with our 
processes on both routine and non-routine 
bases, ensuring proactive identification and 
mitigation of potential hazards.
	
	
Our commitment to maintaining high 
environmental and safety standards 
is further demonstrated through the 
governance of all manufacturing processes 
by our Quality, Environment, Health, and 
Safety (QEHS) policy. Each operational 
area is meticulously monitored through ISO 
14001 certified Environment Management 
Systems and ISO 45001 Occupational 
Health and Safety management systems, 
facilitating the continuous improvement of 
our practices and the identification of any 
gaps.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If yes, then provide 
details.
	
Yes, our company is dedicated to optimising operations and enhancing efficiency through several strategic 
initiatives:
	
A.	
Cooling Tower Optimisation: A centralised control system coupled with fan driven through 
temperature sensor for cooling towers has yielded impressive results. This approach has led to a yearly 
saving of 2.36 lakh units of electricity and a reduction of water evaporation losses by a remarkable 86 
lakh liters.
	
B.	
UPS System Upgrade: By implementing the latest IGBT technology with a highly efficient (95%) UPS 
system featuring an N+1 paralleling scheme, we have achieved an estimated 10% reduction in energy 
consumption compared to the previously used technology.
	
C.	
PHE System Integration: The integration of a PHE system for buffering and sheathing machines has 
resulted in improved efficiency and reduced chiller operation. This innovative approach has led to a 
combined annual saving of 7.8 lakh units across the FG and buffering sections.
	
D.	
Circulation Pump Optimisation: Modifications made to water pipeline units have optimised circulation 
pumps, leading to yearly energy savings of 81,360 units.
	
E.	
Rooftop Solar Power: The installation of a rooftop green solar system, along with a new roof sheet 
and skylights, has yielded multiple benefits. During daylight hours, the skylights provide natural light, 
reducing the need for artificial plant lighting. This has resulted in the yearly saving of 1 lakh units of 
electricity and cost savings of ` 6.5 lakh.
	
F.	
Dry-type Resin Cast Transformer: The adoption of a dry-type resin cast transformer boasts 
high efficiency and eliminates the need for annual maintenance, generating savings of ` 1.2 lakh. 
Additionally, this oil-free design aligns with our commitment to achieving zero waste to landfill.
	
These initiatives underscore our commitment to sustainable practices and continuous improvement, 
contributing to both environmental stewardship and operational excellence.

Outcome of the initiative
1
Rooftop Solar 
Power
The installation of a rooftop green solar system, 
along with a new roof sheet and skylights, has 
yielded multiple benefits. During daylight hours, 
the skylights provide natural light, reducing the 
need for artificial plant lighting.
This has resulted in the yearly 
saving of 1 lakh units of electricity 
and cost savings of ` 6.5 Lakh
2
Cooling Tower 
Optimization
A centralised control system coupled with fan 
driven through temperature sensor for cooling 
towers has yielded impressive results.
This approach has led to a 
yearly saving of 2.36 lakh units 
of electricity and a reduction of 
water evaporation losses by a 
remarkable 86 lakh liters
3
PHE System 
Integration
The integration of a PHE system for buffering 
and sheathing machines has resulted in 
improved efficiency and reduced chiller 
operation.
This innovative approach has led 
to a combined annual saving of 
7.8 lakh units across the FG and 
buffering sections

Ensuring zero 
liquid/effluent 
discharge into 
communities
To ensure Zero liquid discharge, a detailed 
study of parameters has been done on the 
wastewater before its treatment in the ETP 
which has in turn helped reduce the load on the 
plant.
https://www.stl.tech/esg/
Each of our manufacturing units 
in Aurangabad and Silvassa are 
all zero-liquid discharge certified. 
Effluent treatment (ETP) and 
multi-effective evaporator (MEE) 
plants installed, in addition to 
several in-plant modifications to 
our processes help us ensure this.

Ensuring 100% 
manufacturing 
facilities to be 
Zero Waste 
to Landfill 
certified
We ensure our processes comply with stringent 
waste management rules in the countries we 
operate, we also verify the approaches our 
recyclers adopt. This assures us that they are 
operating according to the prescribed laws and 
our by-products or waste are further reused, 
promoting a circular economy.
