(R/O)

In case of risk, approach

Financial implications of 
the risk or opportunity 
(Indicate positive or 
negative implications)
1
Chemical
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk:
Shifting consumer preference 
towards safe & sustainable 
products. Additionally, the 
regulatory environment is 
getting more stringent on 
the sustainability aspects of 
chemicals and its associated 
impacts.
Opportunity:
To become a globally  preferred 
denim brand in manufacturing 
safe, sustainable products 
while adhering to all regulatory 
compliances
We are engaged with our 
vendors and suppliers 
for the elimination of 
hazardous chemicals 
and to implement safer 
sustainable products
Positive:
Reputational benefit 
resulting in increased 
demand for goods. 
Increased revenue due 
to better competitive 
position to reflect 
shifting consumer 
preferences.
Negative:
Reduced revenue from 
decreased demand of 
goods 
2
People
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk:
Reputational risk if we fail to 
ensure fair labour practices, 
protection of human rights, 
health and safety of our 
employee & workers.
Opportunity:
By addressing the above 
risks, we are securing our 
social license to operate and 
representing ourselves
Promoting inclusiveness, 
leadership qualities, 
retaining talent, 
creating friendly work 
arrangements
Positive:
While ensuring our 
people’s prosperity in 
consideration, we seek 
to improve employee 
satisfaction, better 
retention and lowering 
cost of management.
Negative:
Reduced revenue due 
to negative impact on 
workforce.
3
Energy 
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk:
While energy contributes 
to the growth of textile and 
apparel industry, resulting 
emissions are a dampener 
for environmental health. 
Increasing demand of textile 
and apparels in the world, 
followed by increased 
production is the cause of 
higher GHG emissions.
Opportunity:
Improving upon the energy 
efficiency and increasing 
renewable usage will support 
us in cutting down the energy 
expenses and achievement of 
pertinent emission reduction 
commitments.
We have implemented 
2 MW Wind Mill Power 
Project for captive 
electricity consumption 
and under process for 
installation of solar 
rooftop system in the 
coming years.
Positive:
Wind Mill Project 
installation for captive 
consumption shall 
result in reduction 
in energy cost and 
reduction in fuel 
consumption
Negative:
Due to increase in 
price of fuel and 
energy, the cost of 
production increases

management and consumer 
engagement
NA
Positive:
Partnering with 
innovative summit, 
product innovation, 
digital transformation, 
Sewage Treatment 
plant.
5
Cotton
Risk
Cotton is our main raw material 
and being an agricultural 
product it is dependent 
on weather/ environment. 
Inadequate rain results in lower 
production of cotton and in turn 
result high price of cotton
Preparation of advance 
strategic plan for 
purchase of cotton to 
mitigate any shortage in 
raw material.
Negative
Increase in cost of raw 
materials which in turn 
results in increase in 
product cost.
6
Natural fiber
Opportunity
Due to increasing green 
revolution and environment 
sustainability, the use of 
natural fiber is increasing 
due to increase in demand by 
customers.
NA
Positive Implications
Increase in revenue 
due to increase in 
demand of sustainable 
products
7
Water
Risk
Water is one of the essential 
requirement for our operation, 
even for cultivation of cotton 
and due to its scarcity, efficient 
management of water is highly 
essential for our operations
We recycle and reuse 
water by establishing 
an Effluent Treatment 
Plant (ETP) and a Reverse 
Osmosis Plant (RO) within 
our facility. We also 
treat wastewater with 
our Sewage Treatment 
Plant (STP) and reuse 
the treated water for 
gardening. In order to 
utilize backwash water, 
we have also installed a 
pipeline from the power 
plant to the fabric division. 
So, we can conserve the 
water by minimizing the 
extraction of water
May increase 
production and 
operations cost
8
Climate 
Change
Risk
Due to inadequate climate 
conditions and unseasonal 
rain, the production of cotton 
and other essential raw 
materials are effected which 
results in scarcity of available 
raw materials
The company prepares 
a strategic plan for 
mitigating the risk in line 
with production
Negative implication
Non Availability of 
raw materials at 
reasonable price, 
which results in 
sourcing of materials 
at higher price.
9
Carbon 
generated 
from use 
of non-
renewable 
energy
Opportunity
Company’s business is highly 
energy intensive. Higher 
fossil fuel consumption has a 
severe impact on environment. 
Adoption and use of renewable 
energy will help address this risk
-	 Installation of solar 
plants/rooftops
-	 Installation of wind 
power 
-	 Energy saving initiatives
Long term financial 
benefits due to saving 
in fuel cost
10
Emerging 
Regulatory 
Compliances
Risk
Regulations w.r.t. water & air 
pollution, waste disposal are 
getting stringent with time 
demanding transparency and 
accountability
Keeping pace with the 
regulatory requirements 
and deploying entity wide 
compliance management
Increased compliance 
cost and threat of legal 
liability
