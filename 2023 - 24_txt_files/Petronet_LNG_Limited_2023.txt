GOVERNANCE, LEADERSHIP AND OVERSIGHT
7.	
Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets 
and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure) 
	
It gives me immense pleasure to present to you PLL’s Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) for FY 
2023-24. The report has been prepared in compliance with the updated format (Annexure II) prescribed by the Securities 
and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). This report reflects our dedication to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) 
principles and outlines PLL’s progress in addressing key challenges, and achieving meaningful milestones. 
	
We recognize that our operations impact the environment, society, and our stakeholders. Our challenges include reducing 
carbon emissions, minimizing waste, promoting diversity and inclusion, and ensuring ethical supply chain practices. We 
face these challenges with the aim to drive positive change.
	
In the 28th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Paris Agreement 
(COP28), an objective was set to achieve zero routine flaring (burning excess gas) from oil and gas operations by 2030. 
This was followed by a consensus reached in COP27 that natural gas would be the bridge fuel for the next four to five 
decades in the world’s pursuit of controlling and minimizing the usage of heavily polluting fuels. In the same backdrop, 
the Government of India aims to augment the use of natural gas from currently about 6% to 15% in the energy mix of 
India by 2030. Therefore, usage of natural gas as a cleaner alternative bears immense importance.
	
PLL currently handles around 74% of LNG imports in India and caters to around 34% natural gas consumption in the country. 
To contribute to the objective of achieving a cleaner environment, PLL has achieved a significant milestone of extending its 
LNG Sale Purchase Agreement (SPA) with QatarEnergy for 7.5 MMTPA for 20 years starting from 2028. Many projects are 
being planned and executed to increase the company’s regasification capacity from 22.50 MMTPA to 31.50 MMTPA.
	
In the context of ESG, PLL has identified key issues, such as water management, waste management, carbon emissions, 
community engagement, air quality, human capital development, business ethics and accountability, etc. Accordingly, the 
company addresses the challenges faced by the industry and mitigates their impact on the environment and society. PLL 
engages with the communities under various CSR projects and contributes to the society, aiding in various societal issues. 
Customer orientation, innovation and R&D are the focus areas of PLL in pursuit of excellence in ESG practices.
	
PLL remains committed to excellence as it navigates the ESG journey. To make available LNG as a cleaner fuel alternative 
to the nation and adopt sustainable practices to ensure business growth, ESG bears utmost importance for us.
	
Together, we can create a sustainable future.

•	
Utilizing chilled water for building AC system and 
Nitrogen generation plant instead of refrigerant 
system.
Saving in consumption of 
energy
4.
In Dahej terminal diesel 
consumption in tugboats 
is reduced due to 
supplying shore electric 
power from terminal 
to tugboat while idling, 
since Dec-23.
•	
Marine Crafts while idling at berth require power 
to maintain their lights, heating, cooling, and 
other essential functions onboard.  This power is 
typically provided by running the vessel’s diesel-
fuelled auxiliary engines (AEs).
•	
  This power is now supplied from shore electrical 
power. Use of shore power allows the vessel to 
turn off its auxiliary engines and stop burning 
Diesel. Shore power is therefore an effective way 
of reducing air emissions.
Dahej terminal has been 
able to save 25,766 Liters 
(Electricity consumed-55310 
Kw) of diesel till March 2024 
and corresponding carbon 
footprints.
5.
Innovative initiative 
has been taken by PLL 
to utilize cold energy 
of LNG in upcoming 
petrochemical plant 
•	
Initiative to replace refrigerant with cold 
energy inherited with LNG is taken to replace 
conventional design of refrigerant utilization
GHG emission and energy 
used for the cooling process 
in petrochemical will be 
optimized.
6.
Optimised operations 
at both terminals to 
reduce specific energy 
consumption
•	
Both terminals are optimizing operations to 
reduce specific power consumptions
Kochi terminal Specific power 
consumption is reduced to 
0.478 kWh/MMBtu during FY 
2023-24 surpassing previous 
best of 0.512 kWh/MMBtu
7.
In shipping operational 
efficiency for voyage fuel 
consumption is enhanced 
•	
Fuel optimization during voyage including 
berthing at Jetty is optimized.
Energy consumption is 
Reduced by 2.75 % of total 
loaded quantity as compared 
to last FY 2022-23.
8.
Reduction in emissions 
from GTG
•	
In a significant step toward reducing GHG 
emissions, PLL has successfully reduced its 
reliance on Gas Turbine Generators (GTGs) at the 
Kochi terminal and same practice is continuing to 
manage operations without GTG operations.

Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan? Give details in 100 words/ web link.
	
Both the Dahej and Kochi LNG plants have an Emergency Response Disaster Management Plan (ERDMP) in place. In the 
event of an emergency, PLL is prepared with a comprehensive and well-defined emergency response plan that ensures 
quick and effective action to mitigate the impact.
	
Additionally, the company has implemented a structured approach to recover from disasters and maintain critical IT 
services through a robust Business Continuity Planning (BCP) framework. To ensure resilience and uninterrupted service, 
PLL has established two strategically located data centres: one at its corporate office and the other at its regasification site 
in Dahej, Gujarat.
	
The IT Business Continuity Plan (IT BC Plan) reflects PLL’s extensive preparedness in terms of people, processes, and 
technology. This plan ensures that critical IT services, such as SAP systems, email, and data storage, remain operational 
during any disaster. The company has meticulously developed Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BC/DR) plans 
for these essential IT services, detailing specific procedures and protocols to follow in the event of a disruption.
	
These measures highlight PLL’s commitment to maintaining seamless operations and minimizing downtime, thereby 
safeguarding its infrastructure and ensuring continuous support for its business functions”.
6.	
Disclose any significant adverse impact to the environment, arising from the value chain of the entity. What mitigation 
or adaptation measures have been taken by the entity in this regard.
	
PLL intends to incorporate sustainability in its value chain and develop a plan in the future to collaborate with value chain 
partners to adopt sustainable practices. This will help PLL to reduce the impact on the environment.
7.	
Percentage of value chain partners (by value of business done with such partners) that were assessed for environmental 
impacts.
	
PLL intends to assess the value chain partners by establishing a sustainable supply chain framework and developing ESG 
criteria for the suppliers in the future. The company also plans to identify its critical suppliers and update the supplier 
code of conduct to ensure ethical and sustainable practices are incorporated by the company’s suppliers.
