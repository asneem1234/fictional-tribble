with its ﬁ nancial implications as per the following format.

1.
Climate Risk 
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity
Physical risks such as ﬂ oods, 
drought, water stress, cyclones, 
temperature 
extremes 
and 
wildﬁ res 
and 
transitional 
risks such as carbon taxation, 
mandatory use of renewable 
energy 
regulations, 
shifting 
preference towards green and 
sustainable 
alternatives 
can 
impact the ﬁ nancial performance 
of the borrowers. Thus, increasing 
the 
credit 
risk. 
Reputational 
risk could also arise in case REC 
is unable to meet stakeholder 
expectations on climate related 
disclosures.
While climate change poses a 
risk, increased awareness about 
climate change has accelerated 
adoption of renewable energy, 
thereby creating an opportunity 
to ﬁ nance these projects.
REC has formulated & implemented 
an ESG policy covering the focus 
areas inter alia including climate 
change strategy.
Furthermore, REC also plans to 
integrate climate risk assessment 
in project evaluation process and 
prepare climate risk disclosure 
in line with RBI Draft Disclosure 
framework 
on 
Climate-related 
Financial Risks in future. 
REC is positioning itself to ensure 
that transition to greener energy 
is at the core of its business growth 
objectives. During ﬁ nancial year 
2023-24, while the company’s 
overall sanction has grown by 34% 
Y-o-Y basis, sanction in renewables 
projects has seen a massive growth 
of 533% Y-o-Y. Going forward REC 
endeavours to increase the share 
of clean energy portfolio from 
current about 8% to 30% of its loan 
book by ﬁ nancial year 2030.
Negative: potential 
possibility of asset 
stranding due to 
climate risk.
Positive: 
ability 
to 
tap 
into 
sustainable ﬁ nance 
instruments such 
as green bonds.
2.
Energy and 
Emissions 
Management
Opportunity
REC 
acknowledges 
the 
importance 
of 
transitioning 
towards a low carbon economy 
and thus plans to work towards 
carbon 
neutrality 
in 
near 
future. Eﬃ  cient energy use and 
emissions reduction not only 
help in mitigating climate change 
but also lead to cost savings and 
enhanced corporate reputation.
India’s 
updated 
Nationally 
Determined Contribution (NDC) 
and aim to achieve net-zero 
emissions by 2070 also serve as an 
opportunity for REC to increase 
the share of green projects in 
its portfolio. REC can explore 
initiative for actively supporting 
environmentally 
favourable 
projects in sectors like renewable 
energy, electric vehicles, Green 
Hydrogen etc. As global and 
national 
policies 
increasingly 
favour green investments, REC 
is well positioned to capitalize 
these trends. REC’s proactive 
approach in ﬁ nancing projects 
that align with environmental 
goals not only helps in mitigating 
climate related risks but also 
enhances its reputation.
-
Positive: 
cost 
savings 
due 
to 
reduced 
energy 
use and increased 
eﬃ  ciency in own 
operations. 
Ability to tap into 
sustainable ﬁ nance 
instruments such 
as green bonds.

Community 
Development
Opportunity
Community engagement and 
development can impact the 
company's 
social 
license 
to 
operate, reputation and long-
term sustainability. By engaging 
with local communities, REC 
fosters 
positive 
relationships, 
address 
community 
concerns 
and 
promote 
economic 
development, enhancing project 
acceptance and minimizing social 
risks. 
Additionally, 
investing 
in 
community 
development 
initiatives can contribute to social 
stability, talent retention and 
overall business success.
- 
Positive: improved 
s t a k e h o l d e r 
relationships, skill 
d e v e l o p m e n t 
and shared value 
creation, enhanced 
brand reputation, 
risk mitigation.
4.
Customer 
satisfaction
Opportunity
Customer satisfaction directly 
impacts 
the 
company's 
reputation, 
competitiveness 
and ﬁ nancial performance. By 
prioritizing customer satisfaction, 
REC 
can 
build 
long-term 
relationship which is essential in 
for REC's continued success and 
growth.
- 
Positive: 
increase 
in 
revenue, 
improvement 
in 
brand image.
5.
Diversity and 
Inclusion
Opportunity
Diversity 
and 
inclusion 
promote a culture of respect, 
equity and innovation within 
the 
organization. 
Embracing 
diversity in workforce enables 
us to tap into a broader range 
of 
perspectives, 
experiences 
and talents, fostering creativity 
and problem-solving. Inclusion 
ensures 
that 
all 
employees 
feel valued and empowered to 
contribute their best, enhancing 
morale, 
productivity 
and 
employee retention.
- 
Positive: 
broader 
talent 
pool, 
enhanced 
brand 
r e p u t a t i o n , 
improved decision 
making, 
reduced 
employee attrition 
6.
Human Capital 
Development
Opportunity
Human capital is a major pillar for 
the success of the organization 
as it inﬂ uences productivity, 
retention 
and 
organizational 
success. By fostering a positive 
work environment and promoting 
employee engagement, REC can 
enhance morale, job satisfaction 
and 
loyalty. 
Investing 
in 
employee wellbeing initiatives, 
such as health and wellness 
programs, 
promotes 
physical 
and mental health, reducing 
absenteeism 
and 
improving 
overall productivity. Moreover, 
providing continuous training 
and development opportunities 
empowers employees to acquire 
new skills, adapt to changing 
job requirements and contribute 
eﬀ ectively to REC's mission and 
goals.
- 
Positive: upskilling 
of 
employees, 
i m p r o v e d 
p r o d u c t i v i t y , 
reduced employee 
attrition.

Opportunity
By

on

practices, 
REC 
can ensure that the goods and 
services procured do not cause 
any negative impact to the 
environment and the society. 
Furthermore,

in providing opportunities to 
disadvantaged business groups 
such as MSMEs, thus promoting 
shared value creation.

Corporate 
Governance 
and Business 
Ethics
Risk
Strong governance and business 
ethics are crucial for maintaining 
investor and stakeholder trust, 
ensuring regulatory compliance 
and 
mitigating 
legal 
and 
reputational risks.
Unethical practices and instances 
of 
bribery/corruption 
can 
damage brand reputation.
Ensuring 
strong 
governance 
practices and communicating 
the same across all levels in 
the company is important to 
build a culture that ensures

Governance, leadership and oversight
7.   Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG -related challenges, targets and 
achievements 
At REC Limited, we understand the importance of sustainability in shaping a better future for generations to come. Our commitment 
goes beyond mere acknowledgment; it is a fundamental part of our ethos and drives our actions at every level of operation. As India 
experiences rapid growth, we recognize the urgent need to balance development with the preservation of our natural resources and 
ecosystems. 
Sustainability is woven into the fabric of our core business operations. We are dedicated to conducting our activities with minimal 
impact on the environment while maximizing positive societal impact. We have integrated ESG considerations into our overall business 
strategy, recognizing that sustainable practices are essential for longterm value creation. ESG factors are now systematically evaluated 
in decision-making processes, ensuring alignment with environmental and social objectives. 
One of our key initiatives involves the promotion of alternate sources of power, particularly solar energy. We have in place a 979 kWp 
rooftop solar plant at our corporate oﬃ  ce and 40 kWp roof top solar plant at RECIPMT, for harnessing renewable energy to meet 
electricity requirements, thus reducing our carbon footprint. The procurement of electric vehicles (EVs) and the establishment of EV 
charging stations further demonstrate our eﬀ orts to promote clean transportation and reduce emissions. As a part of our CSR initiative, 
we have installed solar roof-top power panel and micro grids under Smartgram project, reducing dependence on traditional energy 
sources and improving quality of life. 
At REC Limited, we stand at the forefront of the green revolution, spearheading investments in cutting-edge renewable energy ventures 
while championing energy eﬃ  ciency initiatives. During ﬁ nancial year 2023-24, while the company’s overall sanction has grown by 34% 
Y-o-Y basis, sanction in renewables projects has seen a massive growth of 533% Y-o-Y. Going forward REC endeavors to increase the share 
of clean energy portfolio from current about 8% to 30% of its loan book by ﬁ nancial year 2030 . Our commitment to ﬁ nancing renewable 
power generation extends beyond conventional boundaries, embracing solar, wind and hydroelectric endeavours that redeﬁ ne the 
energy landscape.
In our quest for sustainability, we also prioritize Responsible Resource Management. We have implemented waste water treatment and 
reuse systems, minimized water wastage and promoted eﬃ  cient water management practices.
Our commitment to sustainability extends to our employees as well. We have robust HR policies in place to ensure a safe, inclusive 
and supportive work environment. We maintain open communication channels with stakeholders and adhere to the highest ethical 
standards in all our dealings. REC Limited is committed to being a transparent and accountable steward of environmental and ﬁ nancial 
resources.
Through the adoption of renewable energy solutions, we support India's targets for increasing renewable energy capacity and reducing 
reliance on fossil fuels. Additionally, our initiatives improve the quality of life in rural communities, reduce air pollution and enhance 
productivity through the adoption of sustainable practices.
This section is aimed at helping businesses demonstrate the structures, policies and processes put in place towards adopting the NGRBC 
Principles and Core Elements.

policy, we promote exemplary standards in economic, social, ethical and environmental practices, recognize and mitigate risks 
inherent in our procurement procedures and foster ESG awareness among our suppliers. We also endeavor to support and train 
suppliers on skill enhancement and sustainable practices. We require our suppliers to comply with sustainable procurement 
policies. Furthermore, we expect our suppliers to adhere to the supplier code of conduct and provide ESG data to REC as and 
when requested. The senior management is actively involved and oversees the implementation of this policy.
 
 
The policy is available at https://recindia.nic.in
b. If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably? 
 
 
90.21% of REC’s inputs amounting to `152.96 crore were sourced sustainably and ESG declaration is taken from respective 
suppliers. In case of our subsidiary (REC PDCL), procurement predominantly includes very high-value tenders issued on behalf 
of its clients as a Project Implementation Agency (PIA). These tenders are in the nature of Price Discovery and RECDPCL does not 
own or pay for these assets. Segregating above procurement, RECPDCL own procurement amounts to `47.71 crore in ﬁ nancial 
year 2023-24 and is largely constitutes of Hiring of Consultancy services (`45.6 crore). Considering insigniﬁ cant procurement 
ﬁ gure compared to REC, RECPDCL has not been tracking ESG performance of suppliers as of now. However it is conﬁ rmed that 
RECPDCL has started the process for capturing this aspect of procurement and same will be reported going forward. For GHG 
Emission and other reporting, we have segregated third parties procurement of RECPDCL.

For E-waste and plastic waste generated, we partner with authorized recyclers for ensuring sustainable 
waste management. 
Furthermore, we have introduced mechanisms to promote use of products made of recycled plastic and 
reduced plastic use to very minimal by encouraging use of substitutes such as ceramic glasses, steel bottles, 
jute bags, cloth bags etc.

of India, Ministry of Corporate Aﬀ airs, Securities and Exchange Board of India, Stock Exchanges etc., customers and neighboring 
communities. The process of identifying our stakeholders continues to be an ongoing undertaking, which enables us to stay up to 
date with developments in their needs and respond accordingly. We proactively address their expectations, mitigate potential risks 
and build lasting relationships that are essential to our prosperity, by understanding the needs and concerns of our stakeholders.

5. 
Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress 
grievances related to human rights issues.
 
REC has a human rights policy which applies to all 
stakeholders involved with the company, including all 
employees (permanent or contractual), contractors/
suppliers, partners and consultants. We expect all 
stakeholders to adhere to human rights principles in 
their dealings with REC. REC prohibits all forms of human 
traﬃ  cking, forced labour and child labour within its 
operations and value chain.  REC is committed to providing 
equal remuneration for work of equal value and ensuring 
non-discrimination in all aspects of employment, including 
recruitment, 
hiring, 
promotion, 
compensation 
and 
termination. We prohibit discrimination based on gender, 
age, religion, disability, sexual orientation, or any other 
protected characteristic.
 
To address reports of human rights breaches eﬀ ectively, 
REC has established a robust, eﬃ  cient, fair, transparent and 
open grievance redressal mechanism to address concerns 
of all stakeholders. The mechanism is designed to track, 
monitor and respond to such concerns promptly, providing 
eﬀ ective solutions to aggrieved parties. Any individual who 
wishes to report human right grievances can reach out to 
the respective stakeholder grievance redressal oﬃ  cer as per 
REC stakeholder grievance redressal policy.
 
The grievance redressal mechanism establishes a structured 
and equitable procedure through which both internal 
and external stakeholders can voice and address their 
grievances, concerns and complaints. To ensure compliance 
with the policy and procedures, REC might conduct regular 
audits and assessments of its own operations as well as for 
value chain partners to monitor and evaluate adherence to 
human rights principles.

REC had developed DISCOM Consumer Service Rating based 
on four key dimensions (operational reliability; connection 
and other services; metering, billing, collection linked 
services; fault rectiﬁ cation and grievance redressal) which 
are central to enhancing level of consumer services. This 
will enable the DISCOMs to introspect their performance 
across various service parameters, undertake a comparative 
performance assessment with peer DISCOMs and take 
corrective measures. The Key objectives for the Consumer 
Service Index are: 
 
• 
To create a minimum set of parameters related to quality 
and reliability of electricity supply and consumer service.
 
• 
Track performance of DISCOMs across these aspects over 
a period of time. 
 
• 
Develop a spirit of healthy competition amongst 
DISCOMs to enhance consumer experience. 
 
• 
Nudge the DISCOMs to assess the gap areas, share best 
practices and promote inter-se learning. 
 
Further, REC has an in-house training institute REC Institute 
of Power Management and Training (RECIPMT), which 
caters to the training and development needs of engineers 
and managers of power sector organizations across the 
country and beyond. RECIPMT undertakes various training 
programs including on electrical safety, techno commercial 
improvement of DISCOMs performance, sustainability of 
power utilities etc.
 
In order to promote innovation and technology practices

enable Artiﬁ cial Intelligence / Machine Learning Use cases 
in power distribution. Pilot projects are being supported 
through IITs and Technology Service Providers.
3. 
Mechanisms in place to inform consumers of any risk of 
disruption/discontinuation of essential services:
 
REC has implemented the Business Continuity and Disaster 
Recovery Plan for its data center and disaster recovery 
operations and is also ISO 27001:2013 certiﬁ ed. Further, 
under the guidance of Ministry of Power, REC’s wholly owned 
subsidiary, viz. REC Power Development and Consultancy 
Limited (“RECPDCL”) has implemented the Urja Mitra 
App, which provides a Central Outage Management and 
notiﬁ cation platform for State power distribution utilities, to 
disseminate power outage information to urban and rural

Assurance Methodology
As part of the assurance process, we have relied upon the following:
Frameworks

BRSR Reporting Guidelines issued by SEBI vide Circular No. 
SEBI/HO/CFD/PoD2/CIR/P/2023/120 dated July 11, 2023.
ii. 
SEBI BRSR Core Assurance Circular.
iii. 
Greenhouse Gas Protocol methodology.
Methodology
As part of the assurance process, we have undertaken the following 
steps:
i. 
Reviewed the disclosures under BRSR (9) Core Attributes, 
encompassing the framework for assurance consisting of 
a set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) under (9) ESG 
attributes. 
ii. 
Reviewed the data, documents and other information basis 
which calculation and reporting have been made. 
iii. 
Interviewed relevant personnel of management responsible 
for Sustainability, Environmental Social Governance (ESG) 
and the consultant and their team for understanding the 
process of collecting, collating and reporting the data.
iv. 
Checked the consolidation for various oﬃ  ces to ensure the 
completeness of data being reported.
v. 
Conducted on-site audits for data testing and to assess the 
uniformity in reporting processes. This included assessing 
records and performing testing including recalculation of 
sample data.
vi. 
Assessed the appropriateness of various assumptions, 
estimations and materiality thresholds used by the Company.
vii. 
Wherever required, we have performed a sample-based 
review of data and information. 
Our Opinion
Based on the information and documents provided to us, 
procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, 
we are of the view that the BRSR Core Attributes, as disclosed in the 
Company’s BRSR for ﬁ nancial year 2023-24 have been reported in 
accordance with the requirements outlined in the SEBI BRSR Core 
Assurance Circular.
Statement of Independence
As per the SEBI BRSR Core Assurance Circular, the assurance 
providers shall ensure that the provider or any of its associates 
do not sell its products or provide any non-audit / non-assurance 
related service, including consulting services, to the listed entity or 
its group entities. Based on the information available, we were not 
involved with the Company or its group entities in any non-audit 
assignments during the ﬁ nancial year 2023-24, which would lead 
to a conﬂ ict of interest. 
Restriction on use or distribution
This assurance statement, including the conclusion, has been 
prepared solely at the request of the Company to meet the statutory 
obligations in respect to disclosures made in the BRSR for ﬁ nancial 
year 2023-24. Our report should not be used for any other purpose 
or by any other person other than the addressee without our prior 
written consent. We neither accept nor assume any duty of care or 
liability for any other purpose or to any other party to whom our 
report is shown or into whose hands it may come without our prior 
consent in writing.
Limitations
Our performance under this assurance engagement is subject to 
the following limitations: 
i. 
Based on the agreed scope with the Company, the 
boundary of reasonable assurance covers the operations 
of the Company and its subsidiary across all oﬃ  ces. Further, 
the assurance is being made only for the disclosures made 
under BRSR Core Attributes for ﬁ nancial year 2023-24. 
ii. 
During the assurance engagement, we have relied on the 
data and information provided by the Company. We have 
assumed that the Company has provided us with complete 
and authentic data and other information necessary for the 
performance of the assurance. In some cases, the Company 
has relied on third-party data sources, we have not veriﬁ ed 
the authenticity of the data source. 
iii. 
The absence of a signiﬁ cant body of established standards 
on which to evaluate and measure non-ﬁ nancial information 
allows for diﬀ erent but acceptable measurement techniques, 
which can aﬀ ect comparability between entities.
iv. 
Preparation of BRSR is the responsibility of the Company. 
We have not been involved in evaluating or assessing any 
ﬁ nancial data/performance of the Company. We have solely 
relied upon the Company's audited ﬁ nancial reports for the 
correctness of the ﬁ nancial data. 
v. 
The assurance considers an uncertainty of ±5% based on the 
materiality threshold for estimation/measurement errors 
and omissions pursuant to the GHG Protocol. 
vi. 
The assurance does not cover the Company's statements that 
express opinions, claims, beliefs, aspirations, expectations, 
aims, or future intentions of any kind, if any. 
vii. 
The assurance does not include a review of legal compliance 
regarding the disclosures made with respect to the BRSR 
Core Attribute.
