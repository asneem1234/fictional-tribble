Financial implications of the risk

1
 Water 
Management
Risk
 Water scarcity remains a 
pressing global concern, 
making efficient and 
responsible water 
management crucial 
for ensuring availability 
for essential needs, 
such as drinking water, 
agriculture, and industrial 
purposes.
The organization upholds a rigorous and 
proactive approach to water conservation 
and management, focusing on recycling 
and optimization. Through its ‘zero 
liquid discharge’ policy, no wastewater 
is released; instead, treated water is 
repurposed for developing green areas. 
This practice enhances environmental 
preservation and resource efficiency.
Positive. While maintaining the 
“Zero Liquid Discharge” system 
requires ongoing investments, 
the long-term benefits outweigh 
the associated costs, ensuring 
sustainable water practices and 
resource efficiency.
 2. 
Ethics and 
Compliance
 
Opportunity
Maintaining a strong 
culture of ethics and 
compliance helps 
minimize legal risks, 
potential reputational 
damage, and costly legal 
consequences, while 
fostering trust among 
stakeholders.
The organization continues to 
integrate ethics and compliance into its 
organizational culture, establishing a solid 
foundation for sustainable growth and 
maintaining a positive reputation.
Positive. Reduced attrition yields 
cost savings in re-hiring and 
training expenses, while enhancing 
overall employee efficiency.
3. 
Employee 
Wellbeing
Risk
Neglecting employee 
wellbeing poses 
substantial risks that can 
detrimentally affect the 
organization's overall 
performance and success.
The organization maintains transparent 
policies regarding employee 
compensation, promotion, and grievance 
redressal processes, fostering a supportive 
and inclusive work environment. Internal 
programs and initiatives enhance 
employee belonging, engagement, and 
commitment.
Positive. Investing in employee 
wellbeing contributes to increased 
productivity, reduced absenteeism, 
and improved employee retention, 
ultimately leading to cost savings 
and improved profitability.
4.
Product 
Innovation, 
Safety, and 
Quality
Opportunity Developing innovative 
products that align with 
evolving customer needs 
and preferences, all while 
upholding stringent 
standards of safety and 
quality, is paramount 
for distinguishing the 
organization amidst 
competitors. This not only 
attracts a wider customer 
base it also cultivates trust 
among stakeholders.
The organization continues to prioritize 
innovation, safety, and quality in its 
product development and manufacturing 
processes, ensuring compliance with 
regulations and meeting customer 
expectations.
Positive. Innovative and high-
quality products can command 
premium pricing, leading to 
increased revenue and profitability, 
while building customer loyalty 
and trust.
5.
Waste 
Management
Risk
Adhering to government 
regulations and 
guidelines regarding 
waste disposal is crucial 
to avoid penalties, legal 
consequences, and 
adverse environmental 
effects such as pollution 
and ecosystem damage.
The organization prioritizes 
environmentally-conscious manufacturing 
practices, reducing chemical use, and 
implementing waste reduction strategies. 
Meticulous scrutiny ensures generated 
waste is recyclable thereby, conserving 
valuable resources and minimizing 
environmental impact.
Negative. While waste 
management practices require 
investments in responsible disposal 
and recycling processes, the costs 
are offset by avoiding potential 
fines, legal expenses, and damage 
control measures linked with non-
compliance.

6.
Energy 
Consumption
Risk
Increasing energy costs 
and potential availability 
restrictions pose risks to 
business operations and 
profitability.
The organization prioritizes energy 
efficiency measures, such as 
implementing renewable energy sources, 
optimizing processes, and adopting 
energy-saving technologies to reduce 
overall energy consumption and mitigate 
the impact of rising costs and potential 
disruptions.
Negative, but mitigated. While 
energy costs may increase, 
the organization's proactive 
approach to energy efficiency and 
diversification of energy sources 
helps minimize the financial 
impact and ensure long-term 
operational sustainability.
7.
Respect for 
Human Rights
Opportunity Demonstrating a strong 
commitment to human 
rights builds trust 
among stakeholders, 
including customers, 
investors, employees, 
and the community, 
while creating a safe and 
inclusive environment 
that helps attract and 
retain top talent.
The organization continues to uphold 
its commitment to respecting human 
rights through its policies, practices, and 
fostering an inclusive and equitable work 
environment.
Positive. Respecting human rights 
contributes to a positive reputation, 
improved employee retention, and 
increased stakeholder confidence, 
ultimately leading to long-term 
financial benefits and sustainable 
growth.
8.
Customer 
Satisfication
Opportunity Customer satisfaction 
plays a crucial role in 
shaping the brand's 
reputation and driving 
continuous improvement 
through customer 
engagement, feedback 
gathering, and addressing 
concerns.
The organization upholds strong 
customer engagement strategies by 
actively seeking feedback and promptly 
addressing customer concerns to ensure 
high levels of satisfaction and promoting 
customer loyalty.
Positive. Satisfied customers are 
more likely to remain loyal, leading 
to increased customer retention, 
positive word-of-mouth, and 
potentially higher revenue streams.
9.
Occupational 
Health and 
Safety
Risk
Occupational health 
and safety incidents 
can disrupt business 
operations, leading 
to productivity loss, 
increased absenteeism, 
work stoppages, 
and potential legal 
penalties and fines for 
non-compliance with 
regulations.
Employee and worker safety remains a 
top priority, with robust policies, regular 
training sessions on safety protocols 
and best practices, and investments in 
state-of-the-art technologies designed to 
enhance workplace safety and protect the 
well-being of the workforce.
Despite the investments in safety-
related technology, personal 
protective equipment (PPE), 
and training, the organization 
recognizes that the advantages 
of uninterrupted operations and 
compliance with regulations 
outweigh the associated costs.
10.
Supply Chain 
Sustainability
Risk
Addressing scope 3 
emissions and introducing 
sustainable materials 
throughout the supply 
chain presents a 
challenging environment, 
with increasing pressure 
for transparency on 
adherence to laws, 
regulations, principles, 
and policies.
The organization adopts a proactive 
approach to supply chain sustainability 
by engaging with suppliers, conducting 
audits, and implementing sustainable 
procurement practices. Efforts are made 
to improve visibility, traceability, and 
compliance throughout the supply chain.
Neutral. While sustainable 
supply chain initiatives may incur 
additional costs, they mitigate risks 
associated with non-compliance 
and contribute to long-term 
sustainability goals, potentially 
offsetting the financial impact.

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your company to reduce 
usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
The Company is dedicated to reducing its environmental impact through a comprehensive NOPLASTIC campaign. This initiative focuses on 
diligently segregating recyclable materials like plastic, glass, and paper to lower the company’s carbon footprint. Emphasizing waste reduction 
and recycling, the company prioritizes reusing old scrap products over acquiring new ones.
Process line design improvements are aimed at minimizing chemical waste through effective drag control measures. Rigorous monitoring 
of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) ensures proactive waste management, supported by a robust scrap monitoring system to reduce waste 
generation. Other types of waste, including paper, plastic, and wood, are collected in designated bags and centrally stored for proper disposal.
The Company’s commitment to advanced technologies is demonstrated by the installation of a quench cooling system, which significantly cuts 
water consumption in patenting and coating lines. Metallic scrap is meticulously prepared and sent to suppliers in a ready-to-use condition, 
fostering recycling and circular economy practices.
Ongoing efforts to boost environmental sustainability include upgrading dust collector systems to manage dust from wire drawing machines. 
To eliminate consumable waste, the ‘Plug and Save’ initiative promptly addresses and fixes any leakage points within the plant.
