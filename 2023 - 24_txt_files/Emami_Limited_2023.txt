1
Waste 
Management 
and Circular 
Economy
Risk and 
Opportunity
•	
Stringent regulations by 
the government around 
waste management
•	
We strive to promote 
a circular economy in 
our operations
•	
Emami’s increased 
focus on R&D and 
innovation can lead to 
higher utilization of eco-
friendly and/or recycled 
packaging options
•	
Continuous sustainable efforts 
toward waste reduction, segregation, 
and disposal system
•	
Initiated a Pilot Project of Recycling 
of ETP waste in collaboration with 
Assam State Pollution Control Board
•	
Usage of Post-Consumer Recycled 
(PCR) plastics in our packaging
•	
Emami Ltd complies with the Plastic 
Waste Management Rule 2016 and its 
subsequent amendments, ensuring 
that waste collection plans align with 
the Extended Producer Responsibility 
(EPR) plan submitted to the CPCB. In 
the fiscal year 2023-24, the company 
achieved 100% EPR responsibility, 
aiming for Plastic Waste Neutrality 
and surpassing expectations by 
incorporating post-consumer 
recycled (PCR) materials in both 
primary and secondary packaging.
Positive – a) Herbal waste 
generated at our manufacturing 
sites is converted into manure and 
utilized as an organic fertilizer
Consumers are becoming more 
aware of the environmental 
impact of the products they 
buy, and they are more likely to 
support companies that prioritize 
sustainability.
b) Using Post-Consumer Recycled 
plastics (PCR) over virgin plastic, 
can save on costs, increase profits, 
lower carbon footprint, and 
improve relations with customers.
Negative – The government 
has enacted environmental and 
waste management regulations 
that promote the recycling of 
generated waste. Failure to comply 
with these regulations can result 
in fines, legal action, and damage 
to the company's reputation

Positive or negative financial 
implications
2
Water and 
Effluents
Risk
•	
A growing population 
and the effects of climate 
change have disrupted 
traditional water sources. 
Hence, water being a 
finite resource will pose 
a risk to our operations
•	
Reduction in groundwater extraction 
at all our manufacturing facilities 
through technological intervention
•	
We continuously take targets to 
achieve the ETP treated water 
parameters exceeding the permissible 
limit, thus, moving on our journey 
towards water stewardship at all our 
manufacturing facilities
•	
We are transitioning towards Zero 
Liquid Discharge (ZLD) at our sites
•	
Rainwater harvesting system to 
recharge groundwater
Neutral – No positive or 
negative financial implication is 
foreseen shortly. We are making 
continuous efforts for better water 
management in our system
3
Energy 
Management 
& Climate 
Change
Risk and 
Opportunity
•	
Increase in temperature 
and excessive heat due 
to global warming and 
erratic rainfall have 
caused a deep impact on 
the cultivation of herbs
•	
Higher fuel/energy 
costs due to enhanced 
regulatory stringency 
and fuel supply/ demand 
imbalance have led to 
an increase in the cost 
of electricity
•	
Increasing concerns 
about energy intensity & 
climate change
•	
We have installed solar panels as 
renewable sources of energy at three 
of our facilities–
»»
Pacharia Unit: 1 Mega 
Watt Capacity
»»
Masat Unit: 200 KW Capacity
»»
Dongari Unit: 320 KW Capacity
•	
We are transitioning towards other 
alternative forms of energy like Piped 
Natural Gas (PNG) and Bio-briquettes 
to increase the usage of cleaner fuels
•	
We are evaluating to collaborate with 
Government for promoting micro 
region-specific agronomic practices 
for supporting the farmers to indulge 
in organic herb cultivation to mitigate 
adverse weather impacts
Positive – Increased solar power 
usage confirms lesser dependency 
on conventional energy sources 
thereby reducing electricity 
consumption cost
PNG is more commercially viable 
than High-Speed Diesel (HSD) 
in terms of fuel efficiency and 
maintenance cost as it offers clean 
and efficient combustion by not 
leaving deposits on heat exchange 
surfaces

towards reducing our Scope 1 & 
Scope 2 emissions through energy

fuel, use of renewable energy
Neutral – Energy efficient 
processes, directly help in 
reducing electricity consumption, 
leading to savings in electricity 
expenditures, and resulting in 
savings in the cost of carbon 
abatement associated with it
5

Decrease in power supply interruptions provided 
access to cleaner grid electricity for a longer duration 
during the year. This resulted in increase in grid 
electricity consumption and Scope 2 emissions which 
were offset by reduced running hours of Gensets and 
reduced Scope 1 emissions. 
•	
Scope 2 emissions rose by 5%.
•	
Scope 1 emissions decreased by 42%. 
•	
In FY24, groundwater extraction was reduced by 8500 
KL, surpassing the target of 4400 KL.
•	
The utilization of bio briquettes and PNG, with their 
lower environmental impact, enabled a reduction of 
111.25 KL in HSD consumption in FY24, surpassing the 
previous year's target of 12.5 KL.
•	
There is an increased use of compostable packing 
material for incoming materials reducing the overall 
environmental impact and resulting in higher waste 
generation. However, the increased generation of solid 
waste is offset by increased recycling.

and processes. In pursuit of organizational sustainability 
goals, our R&D team has implemented the following 
measures in commercial-scale production:
•	
Altering the process for 6 Ayurvedic Traditional Medicines 
to conserve groundwater, thereby reducing water 
consumption. This revised process also necessitates less 
heat energy, leading to a significant reduction in carbon 
footprint.
•	
Conducting tests on all Ayurvedic herbal products for 
Heavy metals by WHO standards to ensure compliance 
with permissible limits.
•	
Substituting sugar with jaggery in the production of Zandu

10.	 Health & safety management system
a.	
Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the 
entity. (Yes/ No). If yes, the coverage of such a system?
Yes. Emami implemented an Occupational Health & Safety Management system at all factories. The 
framework for Emami's Occupational Health & Safety Management System is as below.
•	
Policy and Commitment: Developed a Board-approved OH&S Policy that emphasized 
employee well-being and continuous improvement clearly stating Emami's commitment 
adopting international best practices.
•	
Management System: Implemented a structured OH&S Management System based on ISO 
45001 framework (occupational health and safety management systems). The Company has 
set measurable objectives and targets for safety performance and it continuously monitors key 
performance indicators like safety engagement, occupational Injury frequency rate, safety audit 
score, near misses.
•	
Culture of Safety: The Company implemented behaviour-based safety programs that 
encouraged safe work practices and risk identification. It provided regular training to all 
employees (including contract workers) on hazard awareness, safe work procedures, and 
emergency response protocols. The Company fosters open communication and encourages 
employees to report safety concerns without fear of reprisal and conducts focus activities like 
World Environment Day etc.
b.	 What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and 
non-routine basis by the entity?
At Emami, we believe in a proactive approach to hazard identification which is the bedrock of our 
commitment to “Zero” harm. A detailed HIRA is carried out for all processes at our plant. All non 
standard operations are carried out under a “Work permit” issued after a thorough risk assessment. 
We encourage all employees and visitors to report a hazard wherever it comes to their attention. This 
year we have developed a digitized Hazard Identification Tracking System for all our manufacturing 
units. This system consists of QR codes placed in each zone of the factory. If someone identifies 
any hazard, they can scan the QR code, fill out the form, and submit it. Thereafter the tech enabled 
system ensures the risk is assessed and corrective action implemented.
c.	
Whether you have processes for workers to report work-related hazards and to remove 
themselves from such risks. (Y/N)
Yes, we have a system in place for reporting all work-related hazards and offer suggestions for 
improvements. All employees and workers are provided necessary training on hazard identification, 
and hazard responsiveness and encouraged to participate in discussions related to safety issues. 
All our manufacturing units have safety committees headed by the Plant head with members from 
the workforce. The committee serves as a platform for open communication and collaboration 
between workers and management on matters related to occupational safety and health fostering 
a sense of shared responsibility for creating a safe work environment. The committee periodically 
reviews the existing safety measures implemented in the factory. This involves analyzing their 
effectiveness in preventing accidents and identifying areas for improvement. Based on these, the 
committee recomends new safety measures, modifications to existing protocols, or the adoption of 
best practices to enhance workplace safety.
There are established systems in place that ensure that reporting of any hazard of risk by every 
worker. Once anything is reported it is assessed and mitigated.
d.	 Do the employees have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services? (Yes/ No)
Yes, we have established an occupational health center at our manufacturing units to provide 
medical assistance as needed. Additionally, we conduct health camps every year and maintain 
records accordingly.

12.	 Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy workplace.
To ensure a safe and healthy workplace, Emami Limited has implemented a comprehensive Occupational 
Health and Safety (OHS) program. This program encompasses the following key measures:
Risk Assessments and Safety Audits: We conduct regular risk assessments and safety audits to identify 
potential hazards in the workplace. These assessments help us implement preventive measures and 
ensure compliance with safety regulations.
Employee Training and Awareness: Continuous training programs are provided to employees to 
educate them about safety protocols, emergency procedures, and the proper use of personal protective 
equipment (PPE). We also conduct regular safety drills and workshops to reinforce safety awareness.
Safety Policies and Procedures: We have established detailed safety policies and procedures that outline 
the responsibilities of employees and management in maintaining a safe workplace. These policies 
cover a wide range of safety issues, from handling hazardous materials to ergonomic practices.
Health and Wellness Programs: To promote overall well-being, we offer health and wellness programs 
that include regular health screenings, mental health support, fitness initiatives, and access to health 
resources. These programs aim to improve both the physical and mental health of our employees.
Incident Reporting and Response: We have a robust incident reporting system that encourages 
employees to report any safety concerns or incidents promptly. Each report is thoroughly investigated, 
and corrective actions are taken to prevent recurrence. Emergency response teams are also in place to 
handle any critical situations efficiently.
Environmental Controls: We ensure that our work environment is safe by maintaining clean and well-
ventilated workspaces, controlling exposure to harmful substances, and providing appropriate safety 
equipment. Regular maintenance checks are performed on all equipment and facilities to ensure they 
meet safety standards.
To develop a positive health and safety culture, Emami Limited emphasizes worker participation in 
implementing and monitoring safety practices. Team members from health and safety interact with 
workers during the evaluation of the occupational health and safety management system to capture 
practical and effective ways of enhancing operational safety.
Emami Limited maintains a trained medical team at all manufacturing units and provides an ambulance 
facility to support in the event of any emergency. To ensure safety at the manufacturing units, a safety 
protocol video is played at the reception to spread awareness among all visitors. The units have dedicated 
walk pathways to avoid collision with the ongoing logistical fleet of vehicles and trucks. Several assembly 
points are created with dedicated white marking rings denoting space to assemble in the event of any 
emergency.
These measures collectively contribute to a safe and healthy workplace, fostering a culture of safety and 
well-being among our employees.

calls or E-mails are registered and acknowledged formally, and queries received over live calls are 
mostly resolved over the call itself. Each complaint is registered by our Customer Care executive in our 
internal complaint portal with a unique tracking number. Complaints over mail are acknowledged 
with an e-mail to the complainant within 24-48 hours. Complaints are then escalated to the internal 
stakeholders/ manufacturing sites for a detailed investigation
2.	
Complaint Investigation: All the complaints are formally investigated at our manufacturing sites, all 
the investigation findings are captured in the report along with the corrective actions if the complaint 
is found substantiated and uploaded in the portal within the stipulated timeline defined based on the 
severity of the complaint (High severity, Low severity, and Medium Severity) for review and approval 
by corporate Quality Assurance.

complainants via email. Additionally, if necessary, defective samples are replaced with fresh ones 
through personal visits or courier services.
4.	
Customer Feedback: After complaint closure communication to the complainant, one formal mail 
is sent to the complainant for feedback through a link with a set of questionnaires, and the response 
is recorded as feedback. Feedback reminders are sent twice and after that, the complaint is treated as 
closed.
