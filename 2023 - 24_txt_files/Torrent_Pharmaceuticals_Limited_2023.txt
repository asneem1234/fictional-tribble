Risk
The use of high-quality and

that 
improved health outcomes 
are 
attained. 
Compromise 
on pharmaceutical product 
quality 
would 
imply 
a 
compromise 
on

overall health and wellbeing. 
This will also entail failure 
to comply with GxP (Good 
Laboratory Practices, Good

Good Clinical Practices).
Any 
lapse 
can 
lead 
to 
product withdrawals, recalls, 
regulatory action, decreased

increased litigation followed 
by 
increase 
in

expense.
•	 Drug product quality and patient 
safety 
are 
the 
fundamental 
principles for Torrent Pharma. The 
Company being in the healthcare 
sector, the nature of its business 
requires the utmost attention to 
the quality of its product. We have 
taken following measures to ensure 
resilience against the risk.
•	 We 
have 
in 
place 
a 
strong 
Pharmacovigilance 
system 
through which all the stakeholders 
can access the adverse event /

Company 
oversees monitoring and managing 
the safety of all our products 
throughout their lifespan, employing 
rigorous systems and procedures to 
ensure that manufacturing quality 
standards, GMP compliance, and 
other regulatory criteria are met.
•	 Audits are conducted by the Quality 
Assurance department to ensure 
that our high-quality requirements 
are met.
•	 Risks are sought to be managed 
by 
appropriate 
laboratory

Water and 
wastewater 
management
Risk
There is a great degree of 
dependency on uninterrupted 
supply of water for continued 
operations. Therefore, water 
management becomes crucial 
for the Company’s operations. 
With changing climate and 
drought like conditions, water 
availability 
is 
increasingly 
becoming 
a 
risk 
across 
different geographies.
Secondly, 
wastewater 
management 
is 
highly 
crucial 
for 
pharmaceutical 
industry. The presence of 
pharmaceutical compounds in 
the environment is recognised 
as emerging micro pollutants 
in aquatic environment, which 
can indirectly impact human 
and animal health. If not 
managed properly, it can lead 
to a high level of ecological risk.
The Company is not only adhering to 
the statutory criteria set forth by the 
Central Ground Water Authority, but it 
is also taking responsibility for reducing 
use through effective recycling.
Water recycling systems are in place 
in water-stressed locations such as 
Indrad, Pithampur & Bileshwarpura 
manufacturing 
facilities 
and 
R&D 
centre. The water efficient designs limit 
the amount of water that can be utilised 
in different operations. Water usage 
monitoring across units enables us to 
strategise the reduction efforts.
We also make certain that our 
effluents are treated properly before 
being reused or discharged. At our 
manufacturing facilities, we have a 
high-tech ETP and a three-stage 
effluent recycling RO system.

Energy 
efficiency and 
renewable 
energy
Opportunity Renewable 
energy 
is 
expanding at a quicker rate 
than it has ever been before. 
The cost of renewable energy 
has 
dropped 
dramatically 
because 
of 
increased 
government 
support 
and 
continued 
research 
and 
development.
Energy efficiency also serves 
as a major opportunity to 
reduce operational costs in 
the long term and is also one 
of the decarbonisation levers 
for our Company.

Robust

well-being drives enhanced 
productivity for the Company.
This 
material 
aspect 
is

Torrent Pharma is a global 
Company with millions of

Any 
ethical 
and business integrity breach 
can hamper the Company’s 
credibility, employee morale 
and may result in significant 
fines and financial loss.
We have zero tolerance for any ethical 
and business integrity breach within 
the Company. The principles enshrined 
in the Company’s Code of Business 
Conduct guide the work culture in 
terms of ethics and law. The Code in 
a real sense promotes honesty, trust, 
accountability and transparency.
It establishes key corporate and 
organisational ideals that influence the 
value system and business operations.
Every new employee receives a Code 
of Business Conduct orientation at the 
time of joining, ensuring that they fully 
comprehend, embrace, and adapt to 
the Code.
Its implementation and adherence are 
aided by a powerful vigil mechanism 
that monitors deviations or disrespect 
in any form.
Negative
Adherence to 
laws
Risk
Torrent 
Pharma 
operates 
in 
various

markets, 
each 
having 
its 
own regulatory landscape, 
which continuously evolves 
changes, 
and 
undergoes 
increased 
scrutiny 
from 
the 
regulators. 
Any 
non-
compliance with regulations 
or scrutiny process can result 
in dilution of financial position 
or jeopardise the Company's 
reputation.
Regulatory risks are managed through 
a 
strong 
governance 
mechanism 
based on the philosophy of ‘zero 
tolerance to non-compliance’. This is 
implemented through:
•	 Assessment 
of 
regulatory 
and 
compliance 
requirements 
on 
regular basis
•	 Robust internal controls
•	 Compliance management systems 
and continuous monitoring
•	 Internal 
communication 
and 
training on the ethics standards and 
compliance systems
•	 Independent 
assessments 
and

compliance by Senior management

SECTION C: PRINCIPLE WISE PERFORMANCE DISCLOSURE
PRINCIPLE 1: Businesses should conduct and govern themselves with integrity, and in a manner that 
is Ethical, Transparent and Accountable.
At Torrent Pharma, we firmly advocate that while adhering to the minimum framework is essential, superior 
governance practices are indispensable for cultivating a sustainable and prosperous business. The core of 
Corporate Governance revolves around promoting and upholding TRANSPARENCY, INTEGRITY, and 
ACCOUNTABILITY in every transaction. Robust governance processes and systems steer the Company on its 
path to sustained success. We ensure that both the Company and its employees conduct themselves in a manner 
that is efficient, ethical, accountable, and transparent at all levels. Additionally, we consistently uphold responsive, 
inclusive, participatory, and representative decision-making.
Our Core Values, which we believe in and constantly strive to build are Integrity, Passion for Excellence, Participative Decision 
Making, Concern for Society & Environment, Fairness with Care and Transparency.
Each of these Timeless Values, a Pillar of Strength, ENSURES OUR LONGEVITY.
INTEGRITY: When Truth is Paramount
Thoughts and actions entail doing the right thing at all times and in all circumstances; whether or not anyone is watching. This requires 
inner courage and conviction, no matter what the consequences are. It is honoring one’s commitments and being accountable for 
one’s actions, end-to-end.
PASSION FOR EXCELLENCE: When best is not enough
Passion for excellence means not doing extra-ordinary things, but doing ordinary things in all pursuits exceedingly well. Passion 
and excellence are forces that fuel each other on the exclusive path to leadership. As we are what we repeatedly do, excellence 
then is not an act, but a habit.
PARTICIPATIVE DECISION MAKING: Involvement that engenders effectiveness
An ideal organisation facilitates participation and involvement of each of its members in various decision making processes, thus 
ensuring their commitment to such decisions as well as its outcome. It provides a platform for seeking and nurturing constructive 
ideas from individuals, teams and units which eventually yields exceptional results.
CONCERN FOR SOCIETY & ENVIRONMENT: When every smile matters
Concern for Society & Environment is a sense of responsibility and contribution to society that defines our existence. It entails making 
a difference in the quality of lives and environment surrounding us. It is important to encourage fellow-members on collective as 
well as individual basis to fulfil the responsibility of leaving behind a world rich in flora and fauna and rich in time tested values and 
ideals and above all rich in social fervour for our future generations.
FAIRNESS WITH CARE: Harnessing equality
Fairness and Care towards all fellow members are inextricably linked. Weaving the threads of equality, irrespective of caste, creed, 
religion and gender, into the day-to-day fabric, ensures fairness for each and every individual. Empathic care recognises needs and 
aspirations of all. Only such fairness and care eventually lead fellow members to the dawn of eternal success.
TRANSPARENCY: Openness that builds enduring trust
Transparency implies openness. It is the opposite of secrecy. It encourages more informed decision making and aids in creating 
enduring trust among all stakeholders.
Our Core values are aligned with the nine Principles of NGRBC.
At Torrent Pharma, we uphold the belief that robust governance practices are designed to ensure transparency, accountability, 
fairness, and responsibility in decision-making, thus contributing to the long-term sustainability of the Company and fostering trust 
among stakeholders. Inspired by the values of "INTEGRITY" and "TRANSPARENCY," we consistently maintain a high level of 
fairness in all our interactions with stakeholders.

Integrated Annual Report 2023-24

a culture of honesty and accountability.
Furthermore, the Company has implemented a 'Whistle-blower Policy,' demonstrating our commitment to ethical standards, 
transparency, and accountability. This policy encourages stakeholders to report any instances of unethical behaviour, suspected 
fraud, or violations of the Company's Code of Business Conduct that could potentially harm the Company's operations, performance, 
or reputation.
In order to protect investors’ interest, we have adopted Code of Conduct to Regulate, Monitor and Report Trading by Designated Persons.
The Related Party Transactions Policy of the Company provides the process for the approval of various types of Related Party 
Transactions (RPTs) and general principles governing RPTs. This brings necessary transparency in the RPTs and ensures that the 
transactions are fair and in compliance with the applicable laws and regulations.

Our assurance engagement is with respect to the year ended 31st March, 2024 information only unless otherwise stated and we 
have not performed any procedures with respect to earlier periods or any other elements included in the BRSR and therefore, 
do not express any opinion thereon.
Criteria
6.	
The criteria used by the Company to prepare the Identified Sustainability Information for the year ended 31st March, 2024 is the 
BRSR Core – ‘Framework for assurance and ESG disclosures for value chain’ and BRSR format, issued under SEBI (Listing 
Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (‘LODR Regulations’) read with SEBI circular SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD-
SEC-2/P/CIR/2023/122 dated 12th July, 2023 (“SEBI Circular”) and the Guidance note for BRSR read with National Guidelines for 
Responsible Business Conduct issued by Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“BRSR Framework”) (hereinafter referred to as ‘Criteria’).
Management’s Responsibilities
7.	
The Company’s management is responsible for selecting or establishing suitable criteria for preparing the Identified 
Sustainability Information, taking into account applicable laws and regulations, if any, related to reporting on the Identified 
Sustainability Information, identification of key aspects, engagement with stakeholders, content, preparation and presentation 
of the Information in accordance with the Criteria. This responsibility includes design, implementation and maintenance of 
internal control relevant to the preparation of the BRSR and the measurement of Identified Sustainability Information, which 
is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Inherent limitations
8.	
The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure non-financial information 
allows for different, but acceptable, measures and measurement techniques and can affect comparability between entities.

Auditor’s Independence and Quality Control
9.	
We are independent of the Company and have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the requirements 
of the International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for 
Accountants’ (‘IESBA’) and have the required competencies and experience to conduct this assurance engagement.
10.	 Our firm applies International Standard on Quality Management (ISQM) 1, “Quality Management for Firms that Perform Audits 
or Reviews of Financial Statements, or Other Assurance or Related Services Engagements” and accordingly maintains a 
comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical 
requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
Auditor’s Responsibility
11.	
Our responsibility is to express a reasonable assurance in the form of an opinion on BRSR Core Information and express a limited 
level of assurance in the form of a conclusion on other selected indicators of BRSR other than BRSR Core Information, based on 
the procedures we have performed and evidence we have obtained. We conducted our assurance engagement in accordance 
with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised), “Assurance Engagements other than Audits or 
Reviews of Historical Financial Information” (‘ISAE 3000 (Revised)’) issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards 
Board (‘IAASB’). This standard requires that we plan and perform our engagement to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the BRSR Core Information is prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria and limited assurance about whether 
the other selected indicators of BSRS other than BRSR Core Information is free from material misstatement .
12.	 A reasonable assurance engagement involves assessing the suitability in the circumstances of the Company’s use of the 
Criteria as the basis for the preparation of the BRSR Core Information, assessing the risks of material misstatement of the 
BRSR Core Information whether due to fraud or error, responding to the assessed risks as necessary in the circumstances 
and evaluating the overall presentation of the BRSR Core Information.
13.	 A limited assurance engagement involves assessing the suitability in the circumstances of the Company’s use of the Criteria 
as the basis for the preparation of the other selected indicators of BRSR other than BRSR Core Information , identifying areas 
where material misstatement is likely to arise in the other selected indicators of BRSR other than BRSR Core Information 
whether due to fraud or error, designing and performing procedures to address identified risk areas as necessary in the 
circumstances and evaluating the overall presentation of the other selected indicators of BRSR other than Core Information.
	
A limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement in relation to both 
the risk assessment procedures, including an understanding of internal control, and the procedures performed in response to 
the assessed risks.
14.	 The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment and included inquiries, observation of processes 
performed, inspection of documents, evaluating the appropriateness of quantification methods and reporting policies, analytical 
procedures and agreeing or reconciling with underlying records.
15.	 Given the circumstances of the engagement, in performing the procedures listed above, we:
•	 Physically visited the site at the corporate office and R&D centre at Ahmedabad and site visit at Indrad, Gujarat for data 
and document verification
•	 Conducted desk reviews of the field operations, Russia representative office and manufacturing locations at Baddi 
and Pithampur
•	 Carried out discussions at the corporate office and manufacturing facilities for data and document verification;
•	 Interviewed senior executives to understand the reporting process, governance, systems and controls in place during the 
reporting period.
•	 Reviewed the records and relevant documentation including information from audited financial statements or statutory 
reports submitted by the Company to support relevant performance disclosures within our scope.
•	 Evaluated the suitability and application of Criteria and that the Criteria have been applied appropriately to the Identified 
Sustainability Information.
•	 Selected key parameters and representative sampling, based on statistical audit sampling tables and agreeing claims to 
source information to check accuracy and completeness of claims such as source data, meter data, etc.
•	 Re-performed calculations to check accuracy of claims,
•	 Reviewed data from independent sources, wherever available,
192
Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 
•	 Reviewed data, information about sustainability performance indicators and statements in the report.
•	 Reviewed and verified information / data as per the BRSR framework;
•	 Reviewed accuracy, transparency and completeness of the information / data provided;
16.	 The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, 
a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is 
substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had we performed a reasonable assurance engagement. 
Accordingly, we do not express a reasonable assurance opinion about whether the other selected indicators of BRSR other 
than BRSR Core Information have been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria.
Exclusions:
17.	
Our assurance engagement scope excludes the following and therefore we do not express an opinion or conclusion on 
the same:
•	 Any disclosure other than those mentioned in the Scope section above
•	 Data and information outside the defined reporting period
•	 Data related to Company’s financial performance, strategy and other related linkages expressed in the Report.
•	 The Company’s statements that describe expression of opinion, belief, aspiration, expectation, forward looking statements 
provided by the Company and assertions related to Intellectual Property Rights and other competitive issues.
•	 Mapping of the Report with reporting frameworks other than those mentioned in reporting criteria above.
	
While we considered the effectiveness of management’s internal controls when determining the nature and extent of our 
procedures, our assurance engagement was not designed to provide assurance on internal controls.
	
The procedures did not include testing controls or performing procedures relating to checking aggregation or calculation of 
data within IT systems.
Opinion
18.	 Based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, the BRSR Core Information included in the 
BRSR for the year ended 31st March, 2024 is prepared in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria.
Conclusion
19.	 Based on the procedures performed as above, evidences obtained and the information and explanations given to us along with 
the representation provided by the management, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the other 
selected indicators of BRSR other than BRSR Core Information included in the BRSR for the year ended 31st March, 2024, is 
not prepared, in all material respects in accordance with the Criteria.
Restriction on use
20.	 Our assurance report has been prepared and addressed to the Board of Directors of the Company at the request of the 
Company solely to assist the Company in reporting on the Company’s sustainability performance and activities. Accordingly, 
the Assurance Statement may not be suitable for any other purpose and should not be used, referred to or distributed for any 
other purpose or to any other party without our prior written consent. Further, we do not accept or assume any duty of care or 
liability for any other purpose or to any other party to whom the assurance report is shown or into whose hands it may come 
without our prior consent in writing.
