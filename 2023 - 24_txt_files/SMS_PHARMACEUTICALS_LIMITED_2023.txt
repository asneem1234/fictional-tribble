At SMS Pharma, we view water through the interconnected lenses of effective usage and conservation. We have to improve water 
conservation by recycling / condensate water and streamlining processes. 
	
Installed 200 KLD RO Plant for waste water treatment. Currently we are getting 138KLD of water after treatment, which is enable us 
to conserve our water consumption from 300KLD to 162 KLD. Total Saving Ground Water 138KL/Day.
	
Enhanced the condensate recovery through controls in the steam condensate System and increased the condensate collection 
from 65 % to 75%, there by resulted in savings of makeup water by 120 KL/day, contributes 60% with respect to total feed water 
consumption/day. By improving the steam condensate recovery, not only reducing water consumption also benefited with coal 
savings by 45 Tones/Year.
	
Apart from water conservation through utilities we are reusing 16000 Lts of water in stage -2 of Ibuprofen process which is being 
used in Ibuprofen Stage-5 for every batch of Ibuprofen. The total quantity of water reused by this recycling process tuned to 
535KL per month 
	
The potential for environmental pollution prevention is one of the guiding factors in developing the route of synthesis and also 
converting by products to useful raw materials for the process.
	
SMS has developed a commercial process to get Neopentyl glycol (from waste generated in the process as residue), which is one of 
the key raw materials in Ibuprofen process. By developing the Neopentyl glycol synthesis from waste stream, not only commercial 
benefit but also environmental protection is also addressed.

Waste water treatment: We are at SMS Pharmaceuticals Ltd effluents 
segregated in to two streams High-TDS Effluent and Low-TDS Effluent.
High-TDS Effluent: 
High-TDS Effluent is collected from production blocks and neutralize 
effluent pH 7 to 7.5 than effluent transferred to primary treatment system 
consist flash mixer, flocculation, and clarifier with chemical dosing’s 
here we separate suspended solids from effluent. Sludge settles down 
to clarifier bottom and sludge transfer to sludge collection tank and then 
transfer to filter press for removing water from the sludge then sludge 
collected in bags and stored in dedicated hazardous waste storage 
shed for further disposal to authorized co-processor/cement industries. 
Overflow water from clarifier collected in storage tank then transfer to 
MEE (Multiple effects Evaporator) feed. Here we collect condensate 
water in condensate storage tank and transfer this to biological treatment 
system for further treatment. Concentrate from MEE transfer to ATFD and 
generated hazardous waste (MEE Salt) collected in to bags and stored in 
dedicated hazardous waste storage shed for further disposal to authorized 
TSDF/co-processor/cement industries.
Low-TDS Effluent:
Low-TDS Effluent collected from Domestic effluent, RO Plant rejects, 
cooling towers blowdowns, MEE Condensate, and boiler blowdowns in 
to low-TDS effluent collection tank after that transferred to oil & grease 
chamber for remove oil &grease from the effluent then transferred 
to Equalization tank-I & II for aeration. Then transferred to biological 
treatment plant for further treatment outlet of biological treatment will 
be transferred to RO Plant for further treatment. RO Plant outlet will be 
transferred to ETP Outlet collection tank. Collected recycled water reused 
for cooling towers makeup & Boiler feed. From last financial year 2023-24 
we have recycled and re used 32,542 KL and in another plant 1,530 KL 
recycled and reused.

Energy Conservation continues to receive priority within the Company. 
The continuous monitoring of the energy Consumptions across the 
Company’s locations, has resulted in improvement in maintenance 
systems and reduction in Distribution losses.
Steps taken by the Company for utilizing the alternate sources of energy:
01.	Facility created to purchase power through open access during the 
power holiday time to avoid the running of diesel generator sets and 
saving of HSD. Participating in the Open access bidding to get the power in 
the cheaper price as compared to the discom prices as per available slots 
to reduce the power cost. /Year: Rs.35Lakhs/Year.

02.	Implemented numerous energy conservation activities in utilities and 
block equipment through performance assessments, automation of

installation of energy efficient motors & Pump sets. 
03.	VFDs are provided for Screw Chillers at resulting in a daily energy 
savings of 300 units per day @ Each Chiller.
04.	Replacement of existing +5degC water-cooled reciprocating type 
chillers with new energy efficient water-cooled screw type refrigeration 
systems installed. This resulted in saving of 80,000Units/Year.
05.	Replaced manually operated valves of utilities with automated control 
valves to reduce the utility Consumption at the Production Blocks.
06.	Installed online tube cleaning systems (ECO MAX) for Chilling plants 
condensers tube cleaning purpose and improve the Condenser Heat 
Transfer Area and Reduce the discharge pressures and Maintain the 
Standard of KW/TR :0.75.
07.	Installed Common header for compressed air circuit for optimum 
utilization of air compressor So Saving in Power Units/Day :30Units/

08.	Installed Steam Condensate Recovery System to achieve increased 
efficiency of the boilers & reduce the fuel consumption.
09.	Installed Steam Condensate Recovery Pumps (Pressure Powered 
Pump) Steam Condensate Water pumping purpose, so there are 
centrifugal pumps are replaced with Pressure Powered Pump, so there 
are power Saving in Units/day: 150Units/day.
10.	Installed Steam Operated Pumping traps used for Solvent Recovery 
Systems so there are reduce in the process cycle time and steam &

Water Conservation Measures taken:
At SMS Pharma, we view water through the interconnected lenses of 
effective usage and conservation. We have endeavored to improve water 
conservation by recycling / condensate water and streamlining processes.
Installed 200 KLD RO Plant for waste water treatment. Currently we are 
getting 138KLD of water after treatment, which is enable us to conserve 
our water consumption from 300KLD to 162 KLD. Total Saving Ground 
Water 138KL/Day.
Further SMS has been planned to recover the water as condensate from 
atmosphere through while using Air handling Units and expected water 
condensate per day will be 20KL per day

By improving the steam condensate recovery, not only reducing water 
consumption also benefited with coal savings by 45 Tones/Year.
Apart from water conservation through utilities we are reusing 16000 Lts 
of water in stage -2 of Ibuprofen process which is being used in Ibuprofen 
Stage-5 for every batch of Ibuprofen. The total quantity of water reused by 
this recycling process tuned to 535 KL per month 
The potential for environmental pollution prevention is one of the guiding 
factors in developing the route of synthesis and converting by products to 
useful raw materials for the process.
SMS has developed a commercial process to get Neopentyl glycol (from 
waste generated in the process as residue), which is one of the key 
raw materials in Ibuprofen process. By developing the Neopentyl glycol 
synthesis from waste stream, not only commercial benefit but also 
environmental protection is also addressed
