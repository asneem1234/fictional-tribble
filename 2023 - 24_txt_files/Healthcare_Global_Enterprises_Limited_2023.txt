to climate related physical 
and transition risks which 
might lead to disruption 
of operations and affect 
business continuity. 
Opportunity: Adapting 
new low carbon 
technologies may unlock 
opportunities for more 
efficient processes and 
will contribute towards 
business resilience.
The Company has 
committed to a transition 
to renewable energy and

4.
Waste 
Management 
Risk
Risk: Management of 
waste is a critical issue 
for the Company to create 
a positive environmental 
footprint. Focused 
efforts for reduced waste 
generation and proper 
disposal are imperative 
to demonstrate the 
Company’s commitment 
to a sustainable future 
and a healthy planet. This 
is particularly important 
with respect to bio-medical 
and radioactive waste 
generated across our 
hospitals. Proper treatment 
and safe disposal of the 
same is imperative to 
protect human and planet 
health. 
The Company has 
developed robust Waste

manner and mode of 
waste disposal. These 
Manuals ensure that strict 
alignment is maintained

of waste can have 
adverse consequences 
for human health and the

Data Security
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Data security related 
risks and threats have an 
adverse consequence on 
the security and integrity 
of the IT system across the 
Company.

digitization that provides 
for a secure IT network.
In order to avoid data 
breaches and loss of 
confidential information, 
the Company undertakes 
regular reviews of the 
vulnerability and the 
threat of breaches to our 
IT system on a regular 
basis. Employees are 
also provided with

also shared to generate 
awareness on safe IT 
practices and behavior. 
Positive: Front-line data

sustainable growth. 
Negative: Lack of a robust 
data integrity and security 
mechanism could increase 
the rate of data breaches 
and result in the loss of 
valuable data that may 
have an adverse impact 
on the business. Breach of 
patient/stakeholder data 
may potentially expose 
us to litigations, fines and 
penalties.

Health and 
Safety
Risk
Risk: Occupational 
health and safety is a 
vital component of the 
Company’s commitment 
towards providing

working environment. 
Ineffectiveness of the 
current Health and Safety 
management programs 
may lead to a large number 
of health and safety 
incidents.
The Company has 
developed a robust 
Employee Health and 
Safety Policy, applicable 
to all staff, to foster a safe 
working environment. 
It provides detailed 
information on process 
and procedures for a safe 
working environment and 
preventive measures to 
be instituted to mitigate 
potential risks. Employees 
are also provided with 
focused training on health 
and safety to promote safe 
working behavior.

regularly monitored 
through strict Quality 
Audits. 
Negative: Frequent health 
and safety incidents will 
have a negative influence 
on the Company’s 
performance in terms of 
both safety and workforce 
well-being. This will impact

and the Company’s ability 
to attract and retain talent.

Company may be adversely 
impacted due to non-
compliance with regulatory 
standards. 
8.
Water 
Management
Risk
Risk: Effective water 
management is imperative 
for a positive environmental 
impact. Given the nature 
of business, water is 
extensively consumed 
across our hospitals. 
Focused initiatives for 
higher water efficiency 
and reduced water 
consumption is therefore 
critical to prevent risks 
to business growth and 
adverse impacts on the 
environment.  
The Company ensures 
regular and focused 
monitoring of water usage 
across locations. Water 
meters have been installed 
at all discharge sites to 
proactively monitor levels 
of water consumption. 
The Company has also 
adopted cutting-edge 
technologies for optimal 
water usage through 
enhanced recycling and 
reuse of water. 
Negative: Ineffective 
management of water 
usage can lead to water 
scarcity, severely impacting 
business continuity and 
growth. It can also lead 
to loss of brand value and 
reputation. 
9.
Human Rights
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Absence of a 
protective environment for 
Human Rights can lead 
to increased incidences 
of discrimination and 
creation of a hostile work 
environment. It can also 
negatively impact the 
Company’s reputation and 
lead to loss of societal 
value. 
Opportunity: As a 
responsible corporate 
citizen, it is the Company’s 
duty to protect and 
promote human rights. 
It will further foster a 
positive image, increase 
stakeholder trust and 
strongly demonstrate the 
Company’s commitment to 
social responsibility.
Enshrined in the Code of 
Conduct, the Company’s 
commitment to protecting 
and promoting human 
rights aims to provide for 
a supportive and robust 
governance structure. 
All employees are 
provided with training 
on these principles and 
are mandated to ensure 
strict adherence with 
the same. The Company 
is an equal opportunity 
employer and has a zero-
tolerance approach to any 
form of discrimination 
and violation of human 
rights. Furthermore, 
focused efforts are also 
made to encourage value 
chain partners to uphold 
human rights across their 
operations.
Positive: Focused 
alignment with human 
rights principles boosts the 
Company’s social value. It 
also reflects the integration 
of these principles within 
the business model to 
provide for a holistic 
approach. 
Negative: Absence of a 
strong governance system 
for the protection of 
human rights could lead to 
employee dissatisfaction 
and loss of productivity, 
thereby impacting the 
Company’s business 
performance in the long 
run. Further, an ineffective 
grievance redressal system 
increases the risk of non-
compliance which can lead 
to financial, legal and / or 
reputational consequences.

Sustainable 
Supply 
Chain and 
Responsible 
Procurement
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Disruptions to the 
Company’s supply chain 
will cause significant delays 
in the delivery of essential 
health services to all 
patients. Non-substitutable 
suppliers also pose a risk 
in terms of continued 
availability of critical 
supplies.  
Opportunity: Supply 
chain plays a determining 
role in the sustainability 
of an organization. 
Integrating suppliers into 
the ESG journey helps 
the Company to develop 
a resilient supply chain 
and cascade a virtuous 
cycle of environmentally 
and socially responsible 
behavior across the value 
chain.
The Company has 
developed long-term 
business relationships 
with dependable and 
reputable suppliers for 
a robust supply chain. 
Strong emphasis is placed 
on supplier knowledge, 
reputation and ethical 
values during supplier 
selection. Additionally, 
during onboarding, all 
suppliers are expected 
to submit a self-
declaration on their 
social and environmental 
performance. Furthermore, 
focused monitoring is 
undertaken to ensure that 
all suppliers are compliant 
with the ESG principles 
adopted by the Company. 
Positive: Effective redressal 
of supply chain disruptions 
as a result of unforeseen 
circumstances is ensured 
through responsible 
supply chain practices. 
Furthermore, adherence 
to responsible sourcing is 
a strong demonstration 
of the Company’s 
commitment to its ESG 
performance. 
Negative: Long-term 
commercial partnerships 
with suppliers may be 
impacted if standards 
related to various social, 
environmental and safety 
aspects are not complied 
with by suppliers, leading 
to loss of business value.

Statement by Director responsible for the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report, highlighting ESG 
related challenges, targets and achievements. 
Sustainability and fostering a positive impact for all stakeholders is a central focus area at HCG. Our operational and 
strategic approach promotes both business growth and long-term value creation. A cornerstone of our business model is 
ethical business practices and providing for transparent and accountable communication. Our third annual BRSR provides 
critical details on our efforts to foster sustainability and positive impacts within our everyday operations while providing a 
holistic view of our social, environmental, and economic performance. Driven by a robust corporate governance structure, 
we are able to consistently deliver on our commitment to positive outcomes for all stakeholders. This is further supported by 
our culture and commitment to providing accessible, affordable and high-quality healthcare to positively improve the lives 
of all our patients. 
Our people form the cornerstone of our success. We strongly recognize our responsibility to provide them with a working 
environment that champions their potential and empowerment. Focused efforts are implemented to provide adequate 
opportunities of professional growth and advancement for all employees, while also prioritizing their personal wellbeing. 
Centered in our culture of care, we also undertake targeted CSR and social impact activities to engage with and support 
our local communities. 
We are also cognizant of our duty to minimize all adverse environmental impacts from our operations. Regular and 
significant investments have been made to implement initiatives focused on energy conservation, water saving and safe 
waste management. This includes increased usage of renewable energy through solar plants, rainwater harvesting, usage 
of biodegradable bags to reduce usage of plastic, e-billing to prevent waste of paper, among others.
The success of our Sustainability Strategy relies on our commitment to continuous improvement. Our future will demand 
increased focus towards climate resilience and responsible business operations. We will continue to remain focused on 
integrating our sustainability priorities into our long-term business strategy. We will also proactively engage with our 
stakeholders, seek their feedback, and collaborate with industry peers and other experts to identify opportunities to drive 
positive change.

Essential Indicators
1.	
Describe the mechanisms in place to receive and respond to consumer complaints and feedback
	
The Company has implemented a robust system for receiving and handling consumer complaints and feedback. Each center 
has dedicated team responsible for managing feedback related to patients' hospital experience. This feedback is reviewed 
in daily huddle meetings and weekly quality meetings involving relevant department heads and unit COOs, with detailed 
minutes recorded.
	
To further enhance responsiveness to consumer feedback, the Company utilizes Konnect Insights, a tool that swiftly gathers 
online complaints and feedback from platforms like Facebook, Google listings, and LinkedIn. Upon receipt of a complaint, a 
dedicated resource is promptly notified who escalates the issue to the respective unit COOs for resolution. Resolution timelines 
vary depending on the severity of the complaint, typically ranging from 24 to 48 hours.
	
Moreover, the Ahmedabad Hello HCG team gathers patient feedback, and discharged patients receive follow-up calls within 
48 hours. Patients also receive SMS links for providing feedback, and a centralized email ID are monitored for patient feedback. 
Additionally, any feedback from outpatient department (OPD) and other patients are integrated into the Company's feedback 
mechanism. These measures enable the Company to address consumer concerns promptly and effectively, continually enhancing
