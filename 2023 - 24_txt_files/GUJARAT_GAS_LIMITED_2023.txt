k
Rationale for 
identifying the risk / 
opportunity
Employees & workers are 
the most important 
resources at GGL.
Owing to the nature of 
business staff health and 
safety is critical for the 
Company.
It is important for the 
Company to provide a safe 
working environment to its 
employees and workers to 
retain and enhance 
employee & worker 
confidence and morale. 
O- Natural gas combustion 
emits fewer pollutants and 
GHGs as compared to coal  
or other polluting fuel 
combustion. As a result, GGL 
has a significant opportunity 
as it expands operations to 
deliver natural gas, an 
environment friendly fuel.
Government/ Authority 
regulations on non-usage of 
polluting fuel can also have a 
positive impact on business 
operations
R - Emission of natural gas 
directly into atmosphere 
from pipeline damage / 
equipment or as part of 
project & maintenance 
activities since Natural gas is 
predominantly methane 
which is a GHG.
In case of risk, 
approach to adapt or 
mitigate 
• GGL has a comprehensive 
Health safety policy and 
places a high priority on 
implementation of the 
same.
• Robust OHS Management 
system with HSE specific 
SOPs & Guidelines to 
prevent Health & Safety 
related incidents    
• All critical activities are 
carried out after detailed 
risk assessment & 
mitigations are 
implemented in line with 
OHS risk registers.
NA
• Effective coordination with 
digging agencies to prevent 
network damages.
• Prompt emergency 
response for quick isolation 
of the damaged section.
• Isolation valves at 
regulator-defined 
distances to reduce 
emissions after isolation.
• Effective preventive 
maintenance plan & 
adherence to reduce 
breakdown instances
• Efficient commissioning 
SOP to reduce natural gas 
emissions, among other 
things.
Financial implications of 
the risk or opportunity 
(Indicate positive or 
negative implications)
Negative, As Loss of Life 
or Loss of Working days 
due to work-related 
illness and injury, which 
may impede the work or 
supply and will involve 
compensations and 
other financials impacts.
Positive, increase in 
operations will lead to 
reduction of carbon 
emissions as compared to 
polluting fuels & increase 
in the overall profitability 
of the Company.
Negative, 
Damages/failure of 
pipeline /equipment or 
planned release of gas as 
part of operation will 
lead to lost product 
(natural gas) into the 
atmosphere may lead to 
financial loss in terms of 
lost unbilled gas.

business, asset & product 
safety is of utmost 
importance.

consequential impact on the 
Company’s operations and 
could negatively impact the 
company’s reputation
In case of risk, 
approach to adapt or 
mitigate

and evaluating climate 
change risks that could 
potentially impact its 
operations and will plan to 
and take necessary 
mitigating and adapting 
steps to combat such 
climate change risk.
The Company regularly 
carries out health and safety 
campaigns among 
customers, and communities 
to address the risk. 
Risk management is done for 
all GGL critical assets – 
pipelines, CGS, CNG Stations 
through safety engineering 
studies tools like below to 
ensure risks are under 
ALARP (As Low As 
Reasonably Practicable):-
• Hazard Operability study 
(HAZOP)
• Quantitative Risk 
assessment (QRA)
• Escape Muster Evacuation 
& Rescue Analysis 
(EMERA)
• Hazardous Area 
Classification (HAC)
The Company also complies 
with the international safety 
standards and local laws and 
regulations.
Financial implications of 
the risk or opportunity 
(Indicate positive or 
negative implications)
Climate change could 
negatively impact the 
operations of the 
Company, resulting in

Improving energy efficiency 
throughout its business 
operations is a key 
component of GGL’s Energy 
Strategy. GGL is working on 
Increasing the percentage of 
renewable power for 
combatting emissions. 
GGL has taken the following 
steps to combat the risk:
• Use of renewable sources 
of energy 
• Switching to Gas based 
vehicles from traditional 
fuels like petrol and diesel
• Strengthening Gas leak 
detection systems & 
process.
• Optimum utilization of 
resources 
• Timely & effective 
preventive maintenance to 
ensure efficient energy 
utilization
• Reducing water 
consumption 
proportionately
• Ensuring authorized 
disposal/treatment of 
hazardous waste such as 
Used Oil for re-refining
Positive,
Shifting towards 
renewable energy might 
reduce overall 
maintenance costs. It 
also contributes to a 
cleaner and greener

• Green Hydrogen Blending with Natural Gas for CGD 
Background: Based on successful running operations of the 
Pilot project at 5% Green H  blending in Gas distribution 
2
network for more than 10 months, GGL was authorized by 
PNGRB to increase H % in blended gas from 5% to 8% in Nov 
2
2023, implemented since Dec 2023. This Pilot project results 
will support in finalization of way forward for H  transportation 
2
through existing gas pipelines and ultimately contributing to 
emission reduction.
Goal: Increase the green hydrogen concentration (to 10% and 
beyond) in the Pilot project and test performance, post 
approval from regulator based on satisfactory results of 8% 
blending in FY 2024-25.
• Injection of Bio-Gas into PNG/CNG system: 
Background: GGL has existing agreements with Bio-Gas 
manufacturers for supplying Bio-gas to be injected into GGL 
PNG/CNG system. This initiative of Bio-gas injection into CGD 
is being driven by regulator and will help in waste management, 
air pollution control and also reduces dependency on imported 
fossil fuel since Bio Gas is produced as a side product in the 
agricultural/food waste transformation process developed 
indigenously.
Goal: Based on Bio-gas manufacturers readiness to ensure 
technical & safety requirements for supply GGL will commission 
two projects on Biogas injection into GGL PNG/CNG system at 
Hoshiarpur-Gurdaspur/Bharuch/Surendranagar/Indore in this 
FY 2024-25.
• Setting up new CNG stations: 
Background: GGL is influencing automobile users in its 
operational areas to use compressed natural gas as a clean 
automotive fuel through various campaigns. GGL has made it a 
priority to expand CNG transportation and dispensing 
infrastructure and facilities. CNG is a popular alternative fuel 
because of its clean burning characteristics and low carbon 
emission in air. Natural gas helps to reduce the environmental 
impact of vehicular emissions caused by the use of other 
polluting fuels such as petrol and diesel.
Goal: In FY 2024-25, GGL plans to set up 22 new CNG 
stations across GGL operational areas. GGL also plans to 
upgrade 62 existing CNG station in terms of capacity 
enhancement, Daughter to Daughter Booster and Daughter / 
Daughter Booster to Online. 
• Setting up LNG storage and regasification facility for 
CNG/PNG supply
Background: Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) is a natural gas, 
predominantly methane (CH ) that has been liquefied for ease 
4
of storage and transportation. This LNG is pressurized and re-
gasified through ambient vaporizers for dispensing to 
customer vehicles as an automotive fuel and Piped natural gas 
to domestic, commercial and industrial customers on priority, 
in areas far away from gas supply point of supplier 
transmission pipeline.

PRINCIPLE 2: Businesses should provide goods and services in a manner that is sustainable and safe
Essential Indicators
                  
The Second Principle is primarily concerned with production and consumption of resources. It focuses on protecting natural 
resources by responsible consumption and creating those products which reduces negative impact to environment and society 
throughout its Lifecycle.
GGL is a company which is into the business of distribution of natural gas, as compared to other fuels it emits less carbon into the 
environment and has low impacts on the environment. GGL is willing to support local vendors, vulnerable and marginalized groups, 
and other supply chain partners who can help us to achieve our strategic objectives and long-term sustainable aspirations because 
doing so would mean aiding the support to the economy as a whole. GGL has Sustainable development policy in place to mitigate 
these issues and tenders general terms & conditions that require vendors to comply with all Health, Safety and Environment, human 
rights & all other applicable regulatory compliances.

GGL has commissioned its 4  LNG Storage & regasification facility (small scale) for 
PNG supply to predominantly industrial customers along with domestic & 
commercial customers at Alang. Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) facilitates ease of 
storage and transportation of Natural gas. This new LNG station eliminates CNG 
MCV trips from far-off mother CNG station & use of Decompression Skid (DCS) 
which was being used to supply gas till date. Commissioning this station has 
reduced around 9,000 Kms per month of truck/trailer movement reducing fuel

a. Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)
b. If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?
GGL is a City Gas Distribution (CGD) Company which provides natural gas to its consumers. Natural gas reduces approximately 
around 50% greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to coal used in various industrial applications. It can also be 
transported through pipelines to various places, thereby replacing the carbon footprint generated by transporting liquid 
fuel/coal through roads/rails. 
GGL has now mandated operating of all hired Mobile Cascade vehicles on CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) as a cleaner 
environment friendly fuel. They were previously being run on diesel. 
The company has a process of procurement through E- tenders which has resulted in reduction in use of paper. 
GGL E- tenders has defined Scope of work and general terms and conditions that covers aspects of sustainable sourcing in 
terms of ethical conduct & environmental compliances by linking these material/service sourcing being compliant to GGL 
SOPs & Guidelines.
GGL contractor sources materials from GGL approved Vendor list. These vendors who are part of GGL approved Vendor list go 
through a qualification assessment process by GGL appointed Third party. Criteria for assessment include ISO certification 
related to Quality Management system & Environmental Management system.
Additionally, GGL encourages its partners to adhere to Safety and environmental standards like, ISO 14001 and ISO 45001.
Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of life, 
for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.
The company is a City Gas Distribution (CGD) company, which is involved in distribution of gas. Owing to the nature of the 
product of the Company, the same cannot be reclaimed and hence the question of reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of 
life is not applicable to this sector.
However, GGL has a well-established process of waste management which includes collection, disposal and further recycling 
as applicable for waste generated during project and operational activities of the organisation. This includes the following:
a) Plastic waste - Plastic waste generated at GGL includes PE pipe short pieces (<5 meters) which cannot be re-used and 
collected by contractor and submitted to GGL stores. Same is checked through the material reconciliation process. This 
waste is then sold through auction at MSTC official website.
b) E-waste - E-waste generated at GGL is from the offices & owned CNG stations. Waste is collected and sent to Stores and 
are then disposed off to E-waste authorized vendors.
c) Hazardous Waste - Hazardous waste generated at GGL comprising used oil from equipment such as CNG compressors are 
collected by GGL contractor for compressor maintenance and is sent to the pollution control board approved vendors for 
recycling.
d) Other non-hazardous waste – Waste such as food, paper, cardboard, metal, glass etc. are collected and disposed/sold as 
scrap to scrap vendors / municipal waste collectors.
Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes / No). If yes, whether the 
waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to Pollution Control 
Boards? If not, provide steps taken to address the same.
Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is not applicable to the company because of the nature of its product and service 
offerings. GGL has an established SOP on Waste management which clearly defines project & operational waste collection and 
disposal. GGL when obtaining consent from the State Pollution Control Board (SPCB) submits its hazardous waste 
management plan and ensures compliance with the requirements of SPCB consent regarding waste management and relevant 
data reporting to SPCB for the same.

GGL is in the business of distribution of natural gas to domestic, commercial, industrial & CNG Consumers. Natural gas and 
other project inputs materials (pipeline/fittings/equipment etc.) procured generally do not include any recycled/reused 
material considering safety requirements & standards. Therefore, over-all no recycled or reused input material can be 
considered for GGL.
Not Available as product recycling is not relevant for the industry. GGL product is Natural Gas which is used as fuel therefore no 
reclaiming is possible considering the very nature of product, also no packaging material is involved.

PRINCIPLE 3: Businesses should respect and promote the well-being of all employees, including those in their value chains
This principle is focused on equity, dignity, and quality of life of the organization employees as well as 
employees of value chain partners. Entities must comply with the regulatory and statutory Requirements, and 
further provide equal opportunity to all the employees.
GGL places great emphasis on employee growth and well-being because these factors boost output, morale, 
and reduce attrition rates. Workers are an organization's most valuable asset since they not only act as a 
conduit between the Company and its consumers, but they also significantly contribute to the overall success 
of the company. GGL has a sharp focus on inclusion and diversity, health and wellbeing and continuous 
learning and development of its employees and workers. The Company’s redressal mechanisms enable 
workers to report issues from across the organization, allowing them to be addressed rapidly and effectively.

8. Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details. 
Reduction of Natural Gas emission in Operational & Maintenance Activities:
GGL strives to lower the emissions of natural gas from its operations, either as part of a planned release or because of an 
unplanned leakage. The majority of these emissions are the result of unintentional releases brought on by third-party network 
damage, but certain emissions are the result of network failure itself. 
A smaller portion of these emissions are also the result of planned releases, which often occur during preventive maintenance 
or network / equipment commissioning activities.
GGL focuses on various educational programs, utility coordination, and campaigns such as dial before dig (detailed below) for 
third parties working in the same area as GGL with an aim to reduce these emissions. 
Apart from this, GGL undertakes a variety of actions/improvements to reduce emissions, some of which are listed below:
• 
Prompt emergency response to reported damage cases for fast isolation of the damaged section.
• 
Isolation valves at regulator-defined distances to reduce emissions after isolation.
• 
Effective patrolling of GGL pipeline network to prevent damages during third party excavation
• 
Effective preventive maintenance plan and adherence to the same to reduce breakdown instances  
• 
An efficient commissioning procedure to reduce natural gas emissions, among other things.
GGL tracks natural gas emissions per 10,000 scm of gas purchased cumulatively on a monthly basis in comparison to the 
previous fiscal year.
Dial Before Dig Campaign
GGL educates and influences stakeholders such as local municipal authorities, other utilities, their contractors, and their field 
staff (including heavy machinery entities like JCB, horizontal directional drilling (HDD) operators, etc.) who undertake digging 
and HDD activities as part of their laying or construction activity through this campaign. The campaign aims to raise awareness 
of the safety and environmental risks of natural gas release into the atmosphere as a result of damage to GGL's natural gas 
pipeline network during digging and HDD operations. Third parties are urged to contact GGL to confirm the location before 
beginning any digging / excavation / HDD activities to avoid causing damage to the natural gas pipeline network. Third party 
diggers/machine operators are also given away utilizable gifts such as water bottles, key chains etc. with GGL contact numbers 
for Dial before Dig/Emergency.
Promoting Natural Gas as Cleaner Environment Friendly fuel
PNG: GGL's business is the distribution of natural gas as a cleaner, more environmentally friendly fuel for domestic, industrial, 
and commercial use. GGL supplies natural gas to industries via its pipeline infrastructure as a cleaner alternative fuel to polluting 
fuels such as coal. GGL by virtue of its Natural Gas sales to industrial consumers reduces the burning of approximately 13756 
Metric Tons of coal per day.
CNG: GGL is influencing automobile users in its operational areas to use compressed natural gas as a clean automotive fuel 
through various campaigns. GGL has made it a priority to expand CNG transportation and dispensing infrastructure and 
facilities. In FY 2023-24, 37 new CNG stations have been commissioned across GGL operational areas, and 51 stations have 
been upgraded to increase capacity. CNG is a popular alternative fuel because of its clean burning characteristics and low 
carbon emission in air. Natural gas helps to reduce the environmental impact of vehicular emissions caused by the use of other 
polluting fuels such as petrol and diesel. GGL by virtue of its CNG sales reduces the consumption of approximately 2693 
kilolitres of petrol per day. 
GGL recognizes and understands the various global challenges and risks related to environmental degradation and climate 
change as a responsible organization. Building awareness about these challenges and risks among employees and the 
community is an effective way to address them. GGL made efforts to accomplish this through the following initiatives:
• 
With the goal of promoting CNG as the most preferred green fuel among potential 4-wheeler users, aggressive CNG 
marketing is being conducted by organizing CNG Car Mela 'CNG CARAVAN'. This FY CNG Car Mela 'CNG CARAVAN' was 
done in Surat, Gujarat in order to engage directly with the target audience. This initiative was also supported by 
advertisements in mass media outlets such as newspapers and radio stations, as well as a simultaneous campaign on social 
media platforms such as Google, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube. 
• 
Natural gas is promoted by GGL as a clean fuel for industrial and commercial purposes. GGL, as a responsible utility dealing in 
clean fuel, ensures the supply of Natural Gas as an environmentally friendly fuel, as well as the related pipeline network 
setup, while effectively managing any challenges in the shortest possible time.

Hydrogen is not a greenhouse gas (GHG), nor 
does it produce GHGs when burned, making it a 
potential substitute for reducing the carbon 
intensity or pollution of some energy or fuel 
applications. 
Since Bio Gas is produced in the agricultural / food 
waste transformation process developed 
indigenously, this contributes to waste 
management and reduction of soil, air pollution & 
also provides boost to entrepreneurship, rural 
economy while supporting national commitment 
by reducing country’s dependency on imported 
fuel.
With Smart pre-paid meters, the company can 
collect payments in advance, eliminating the need 
for manual meter reading, centralized monitoring 
for real-time consumption tracking and timely 
intervention in case of anomalies, ensuring a more 
reliable supply. 
By adopting pre-paid meters, we aim to 
streamline operations, enhance resource 
efficiency, enhance revenue collection, and 
provide better services to customers.

Procuring & 
Use of Gas 
based CNG 
compressor 
Gas based CNG compressors are being procured 
instead of electricity run compressors which 
helps to establish CNG stations at locations with 
less or no electrical supply
This benefits the environment, as the emissions 
from operating these compressors are lesser 
compared to the emissions from correspondingly 
proportionate amounts of electricity generated 
using coal and other polluting agents.

to the Crematorium at Amritsar was 
commissioned in Mar 2024. This is the first 
crematorium being fueled with PNG in the state of 
Punjab.
Free gas is already being supplied to 
crematoriums in GGL operational areas in Gujarat.
The PNG fueled crematorium facility will aid MCA 
in mitigating the environmental impact of burning 
woods by reducing the carbon emissions and 
savings trees. Since this being as one of the social 
causes, GGL supplies free gas to these 
crematoriums as its CSR initiative
