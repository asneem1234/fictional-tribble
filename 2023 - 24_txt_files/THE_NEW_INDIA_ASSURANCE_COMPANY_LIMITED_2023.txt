processes, products, or services 
that

Data Privacy 
& Security
Risk
With the introduction of DPDP Act 
2023, data privacy and its security 
are the essential prerequisites of 
any modern business operation in 
India to adhere to regulated privacy 
principles and practices.
Individuals have the right to 
control how their personal data 
is collected, used, and shared. 
Maintaining strong data privacy 
practices enhances trust between 
the Co. and its customers/users.
Data security involves the protection 
of data from unauthorized access, 
use, 
disclosure, 
disruption, 
modiﬁ cation or destruction.
Data privacy and security are 
intertwined concerns that Co. 
and the employees must address 
to protect personal information 
eﬀ ectively. By implementing strong 
privacy practices, adhering to 
security protocols, and fostering 
a 
culture 
of 
awareness 
and 
responsibility, stakeholders can 
mitigate risks and safeguard data 
in an increasingly digital world.
By implementing robust measures 
and systems, Co. can safeguard 
information, prevent unauthorised 
access, and ensure that private 
data is used solely for its intended 
purposes. Prioritizing data privacy 
and security not only protects 
business from potential legal and 
ﬁ nancial repercussions but also 
fosters trust and conﬁ dence among 
customers and stakeholders.
Negative
Meeting regulatory requirements 
regarding data security can be 
complex and resource-intensive. 
Data privacy has become a 
matter of utmost importance 
for all the key stakeholders 
viz. customers, regulators and 
investors of our Company. 
Any potential risks or breaches 
in this area could result in 
substantial ﬁ nancial losses for 
both our valued customers and 
our business as a whole. 
Continuous 
monitoring 
and 
regular audits help detect and 
mitigate security threats promptly. 
Therefore, it is imperative that 
we prioritize and address data 
privacy concerns with utmost 
diligence and care.
5.

Company. 
By

damage. 
These 
factors 
can 
contribute to the Company long 
term success.

approach, invest in employee 
satisfaction can position the 
company that cares about its 
stakeholders and committed to
