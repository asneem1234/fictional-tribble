FROM THE DESK OF CHAIRMAN

It's a pleasure to share with you the highlights of the progress being made by the Company since we
met approximately twelve months back.
INDIAN AGROCHEMICAL INDUSTRY
In agrochemicals industry, geo-political disruptions over the last 2 years have led to inventory build-
up and price disruptions. This started waning with supply chain normalcy but increase in production
and oversupply from China led to downward pricing pressure. Adverse climatic conditions and uneven
spatial distribution of rainfall further impacted domestic agrochemical demand. In FY 2023-24, the
Indian Crop protection industry has faced several headwinds such as raw material prices drop caused
by global market inventory overhang, El Nino impacted erratic rainfall and resultant low reservoir
water levels. The market is highly competitive with multinationals having the advantage of proprietary
molecules and domestic companies leveraging low-cost generics and accessing niche molecules
through partnerships. New formulation technologies supported by advancement in adjuvants is
increasing effectiveness and safe handling of Crop protection products. India being a leading producer
as well as consumer of Agri produce, needs to sustain Agricultural productivity to ensure food
security of the growing population.
BUSINESS PERFORMANCE
Coming to the performance of your Company, in the financial year FY 2023-24 your Company continues
to perform well on a sustained basis. Amid the volatile circumstances, raw material fluctuations,
commodity inflation and supply disruptions, your Company achieved revenue (turnover) of `1065.53
crores and earned a Profit before Tax (PBT) of `109.42 crores and Profit after Tax (PAT) of `81.61
crores. We have thrust on R&D for developing relevant products for key markets.
The Company foresees huge untapped growth potential for India's chemical industry and strives to
bank on the growth opportunities by remaining committed to maximize its return on investment and
create value for its esteemed stakeholders.
AGRO ECONOMY OVERVIEW
Indian agriculture is on a growth path, with an increase in investments and private funding in the past
few years. In India, Agriculture accounts for a fifth of the gross value added and more than half the
population engages in agricultural and related activities. The sector is expected to grow with better
momentum in the next few years.
DIVIDEND
Considering the consistent profits being made by the Company, your Directors have recommended
a dividend of `1.50 (i.e. 15%) per equity share for the financial year 2023-24.

RASAYAN LIMITED
35th Annual Report 2023-2024
               MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS REPORT
INDIAN ECONOMY
India is acknowledged as one of the fastest growing economies with an estimated GDP (Gross Domestic
Product) growth of 7.6% in FY 2023-24. However, the outlook is cautiously optimistic in the wake of
continuing geo-political crisis.
On the policy front RBI is expected to continue its focus on aligning inflation towards its target.
Geopolitical, climate change, global indebtedness and technology disruptions are the biggest risks
which may impact India's growth momentum. Agriculture sector growth estimated at 1.8% in 2023-24
compared to 4.0% recorded in 2022-23 as the country witnessed the hottest and driest August ever
recorded over the century.
Despite these challenges, India's economic fundamentals remain strong. The Government's commitment
to increase capital expenditure in the coming year signifies its dedication to sustaining growth. The
next few months will be critical in determining the future trajectory of the Indian economy, but the
current momentum suggests a bright future.
Despite the global slowdown, India's economic growth rate is stronger than in many peer economies
and reflects relatively robust domestic consumption and lesser dependence on global demand. Despite
the global slowdown, exports performed well, probably because of the depreciated currency against
the dollar.
A strong digitization drive the world over, cost-cutting measures by businesses to deal with the impending
slowdown, and the growing trend of remote working increased demand for exports of services in
technology, where India has a comparative advantage. Interestingly, the share of business and
professional services in total services exports also increased as companies globally now prefer
outsourcing a wide range of professions, such as accounting, audit, R&D, quality assurance, and
after-sales service.
Economic development and substantial infrastructure development have constituted regional revenue
generation. Further, the patterns associated with domestic production, import and export, and
consumption have helped market participants to analyze and capitalize on potential opportunities.
GLOBAL ECONOMY
The baseline forecast for the world economy is to grow at 3.2% during 2024, at the same pace as in
2023. Advanced economies are expected to see slight increase in growth from 1.7% in 2024 followed
by 1.8% in 2025. Emerging and developing economies are expected to experience stable growth of
4.2% in 2024 and 2025. Stronger global growth can be expected in case of faster deflation, slower
withdrawal of fiscal support, faster economic recovery in China and artificial intelligence driven supply-
side reforms. The down-side risk to the growth are commodity price spikes amid geopolitical and
weather shocks, slower than expected decline in core inflation requiring tighter monetary policy stance,
faltering growth in China and disruptive action on fiscal consolidation.
The global market for agrochemicals has been estimated to be USD 235.2 billion in 2023 and is
projected to grow at a rate of 3.7% between 2023 and 2028. The agrochemicals market is projected to
grow at an exponential rate due to factors such as rising demands for food, climate change-induced
pest damage, growing population, declining arable land and demand for high crop yields.
The increasing population and consequent rise in food demand are expected to propel the growth
of the agrochemicals market going forward. Food refers to the substance consisting of protein,
carbohydrates, fat, and other nutrients used in the body of an organism for sustaining growth, vital
processes and furnishing energy. The steady growth in the population is directly proportional to
food demand and growth in the agrochemicals market. For instance, according to United Nations,
a US-based intergovernmental organization, the world's population has been expected to increase
57
RASAYAN LIMITED
35th Annual Report 2023-2024
by 2 billion people in the next 30 years, from 7.7 billion in 2021 to 9.7 billion in 2050. Also, according
to Intechnopen, a UK-based publisher of journals and books, the global demand for food has been
expected to increase by 70% by 2050. Therefore, the increasing population and consequent rise in
food demand will drive the growth of the home infusion therapy market.
The agrochemical market consists of sales of chemical fertilizers, antibiotics, and plant hormones.
Values in this market are 'factory gate' values, that is the value of goods sold by the manufacturers or
creators of the goods, whether to other entities (including downstream manufacturers, wholesalers,
distributors, and retailers) or directly to end customers. The value of goods in this market includes
related services sold by the creators of the goods.
Herbicides segment is estimated to account for the largest share. Herbicides are widely used to
effectively manage weeds at a cheap cost. They make up the main section of crop protection chemicals
for most countries in all regions. Additionally, the use of Pesticides in agriculture has changed because
of GMOs. Herbicide use has increased because of genetically modified (GM) crops that are herbicide
resistant.
The main causes driving the worldwide herbicide market are changing climatic conditions, dwindling
arable land, and rising food consumption. Integrated pest management is opening the door for pest
control without endangering the environment, despite several regulatory norms limiting the use of
Herbicides. This presents a fantastic opportunity for herbicide producers to capitalize on the market
potential to produce green Herbicides, which are expanding more quickly.
Soil active herbicides also known as weed killers are herbicides that act on seeds, roots, or shoots of
undesired plants, also known as weeds. Soil active herbicides are incorporated into the soil to control
the growth of weeds and unwanted plants. Herbicides get rid of weeds that will otherwise compete for
light, moisture, and nutrients with the crops, affecting the quality and quantity of produce. The main
product types of soil active herbicides are synthetic herbicides, and bio-herbicides. Synthetic herbicides
are made to mimic plant hormones affecting cell growth, development, and tropism and have the
potential to influence plant disease by several mechanisms. These are used for cereals and grains,
oilseeds and pulses, fruits and vegetables, and others in pre-plant, pre-emergence, and post-emergence
uses.
The growth of the population and changing dietary preferences towards plant-based food are expected
to drive the growth of the soil-active herbicides market going forward. The population is increasing due
to an imbalance between births and deaths, lack of family planning, migration, and others. Plant-
based food refers to food that is completely obtained from plants and has no dairy, or meat products.
People in developed and developing countries are getting cautious about their health and maintaining
a regular diet that includes plant-based food. The rise in population needs more production of food to
feed which increases the use of herbicides and other natural or chemical fertilizer which gives higher
yield. Thus, the growth of the population and changing dietary preferences towards plant-based food
will drive the growth of the soil-active herbicides market.
INDIAN AGROCHEMICAL INDUSTRY
In agrochemicals industry, geo-political disruptions over the last 2 years have led to inventory build-up
and price disruptions. This started waning with supply chain normalcy but increase in production and
oversupply from China led to downward pricing pressure. In the Calendar Year 2023, global agrochemicals
industry is estimated to have de-grown by more than 10%. Indian agrochemical exports declined by
22% during FY 2023-24. Adverse climatic conditions and uneven spatial distribution of rainfall further
impacted domestic agrochemical demand. Farmers are responding to the increasing demand for
fruits, vegetables, exotic crops, organic produce, etc. to tap increasing domestic and export demand.
Precision agriculture and data-driven approach allows for targeted resource utilisation, improved yields,
and reduced waste. Government initiatives of promoting digital literacy and rural infrastructure development
aim to support the small and marginal farmers who often struggle to access technology and credit. By
58
RASAYAN LIMITED
35th Annual Report 2023-2024
embracing technology, innovation, and sustainable practices, Indian agriculture can enhance productivity,
empower farmers, and ensure food security for the nation.
In FY 2023-24, the Indian Crop protection industry has faced several headwinds such as raw material
prices drop caused by global market inventory overhang, El Nino impacted erratic rainfall and resultant
low reservoir water levels.
The market is highly competitive with multinationals having the advantage of proprietary molecules and
domestic companies leveraging low-cost generics and accessing niche molecules through partnerships.
It is estimated that India consumes more than 400 agrochemical formulations covering Insecticides,
Fungicides and Herbicides. Combination products are gaining popularity in India as well, as it provides
ease of use to farmers and cross resistance development, which help in extending the useful life of
active ingredients. New formulation technologies supported by advancement in adjuvants is increasing
effectiveness and safe handling of Crop protection products. India being a leading producer as well as
consumer of Agri produce, needs to sustain Agricultural productivity to ensure food security of the
growing population.
Despite the decline, it continues to be the largest source of livelihood for about 58% of India's population
and its growth ensures inclusive economic growth of the country. The Indian agrochemical sector has
risen at an annual rate of 7.6% over the last six years
Crop protection chemicals are a type of pesticide that are used to protect crops against insects and
pests. Crop protection chemicals are an important part of the chemical industry. Many crops would
suffer significant losses if they did not exist. Plant diseases and pests have become more common
because of changing environmental conditions. Also, climate fluctuations have a substantial impact on
crop productivity.
The crop protection industry has been transforming over the years, with robust growth and changing
crop mix trends and environmental regulations. Growing population, declining arable land, food security,
trends of people shifting to vegetarian food and the need for augmented agricultural productivity are the
significant factors driving the demand for higher agricultural output, thus boosting the growth of the
crop protection industry globally. The market growth is dependent on pest attacks, crop yields, and
agriculturists' awareness levels and capacity to buy products depending on their availability of credit.
Increasing demand for insecticides across the globe is also a major factor driving the market growth.
Agriculture inputs play a decisive role in enhancing crop production. With arable land declining, production
of crops can only be increased by using quality inputs through a scaled-up country-wide effort. Concerted
efforts are being taken to transform agriculture, improve farm productivity and farmer prosperity, achieve
food security and environmental sustainability.
Agrochemicals are chemicals that help boost crop productivity through prevention of destruction of
crops by pests such as insects, weeds, fungus, etc. The global economy, in general, and Indian is
facing a multitude of challenges such as to feed an evergrowing population, reducing arable land bank
and dealing with adverse climatic changes. Under such circumstances, the traditional methods of
growing more crops are rendered inadequate. There is a growing acceptance to launch advanced
agrochemical solutions to achieve higher field productivity.
The industry and policymakers are expected to work in the direction of bringing newer technologies,
enhancing manufacturing infrastructure, and creating proper policy environment to help improve
productivity as well as foreign investment in the country to increase the share of agrochemicals in the
GDP of the country by utilizing the huge untapped market still available within India. The agrochemical
sector is expected to emerge as a major global supply hub. To obtain a competitive edge, agrochemical
companies will increasingly focus on incorporating next-generation formulations into their R&D
capabilities and product mix.
It is projected that India's agrochemicals business will grow more quickly because of the nation integrating
farming practices and positive trends. The landmass can be utilized for agriculture, but because of the
59
RASAYAN LIMITED
35th Annual Report 2023-2024
rising influence of urbanization, it is rapidly diminishing, which encourages farmers to use various
agrochemicals to raise land productivity and maintain soil health.
India also plays a big part in the global supply chain, and the government has recognized the potential
of agrochemicals as one of the champion pillars of its economy. India's crop protection industry is
increasingly making use of its R&D facilities as it advances to create better solutions that are safer,
more efficient, and compliant with international standards.
The challenges for the domestic plays are compounding primarily on the back of a higher base of last
year, coupled with higher inventory provisions amidst a falling raw material cost scenario and higher
sales return (particularly in the insecticides grades, which, in turn, is likely to exert pressure on
margins in the near term).
IMPACT OF CLIMATIC CHANGES ON INDIAN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION
Climate change poses significant challenges to agriculture in India, a country heavily reliant on its
agrarian economy. With its diverse geography and climate, India's agricultural sector is susceptible to
the adverse effects of shifting weather patterns, rising temperatures, erratic rainfall, and extreme weather
events. These changes disrupt traditional farming practices, jeopardize crop yields, threaten food
security, and exacerbate rural poverty. The impact of climate change on Indian agriculture is multifaceted,
affecting crop productivity, water resources, soil health, and the livelihoods of millions of farmers.
Addressing these challenges requires urgent adaptation and mitigation measures to build resilience
and ensure the sustainability of India's agricultural sector in the face of a changing climate.
India's tropical location and relatively lower income levels make its agriculture sector more susceptible
to the adverse effects of climate change. Rainfed agriculture, in particular, is at risk due to variability in
rainfall and a reduction in the number of rainy days. The negative effects of climate change extend to
crop yields across agro-ecological regions. Higher temperatures and altered water availability adversely
affect rainfed agriculture, potentially leading to a decline of up to 25% in yields of major crops. Beyond
crop yields, climate change influences soil fertility, pest infestation patterns, and water availability.
These factors collectively impact not only crops but also animal husbandry and fisheries, further
challenging the resilience of the agricultural sector.
Climate change is primarily attributed to disproportionately high cumulative emissions, both historical
and high per capita annual emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) of the developed countries.
Government of India is aware about the impact of climate change on agriculture and farmers' lives.
Extensive field and simulation studies were carried out in agriculture by the network centres located in
different parts of the country. The climate change impact assessment was carried out using the crop
simulation models by incorporating the projected climates of 2050 & 2080. In absence of adoption of
adaptation measures, rainfed rice yields in India are projected to reduce by 20% in 2050 and 47% in
2080 scenarios while, irrigated rice yields are projected to reduce by 3.5% in 2050 and 5% in 2080
scenarios. Climate change is projected to reduce wheat yield by 19.3% in 2050 and 40% in 2080
scenarios towards the end of the century with significant spatial and temporal variations. Climate
change is projected to reduce the kharif maize yields by 18% and 23% in 2050 and 2080 scenarios,
respectively. Climate change reduces crop yields and lower nutrition quality of produce. Extreme
events like droughts affect the food and nutrient consumption, and its impact on farmers.
Unseasonal rains, increase in number and intensity of tropical storms, prolonged drought conditions,
prolonged heat conditions etc. impacted the normal life functions of many communities/countries.
Climate change not only impacts agriculture sector but all the possible areas also. Various reports
suggest that climate change will affect the quality and quantity of various crops. In serious situation
this can also affect the food security of concerned region. It is also reported that impact of climate
change will not be same for every sector and region. The possible effects would be high in tropical
regions as compared to temperate regions. So, proper plans should be made according to the area. As
far as India is concerned, it will face great challenge due to climate change. Most of the agriculture is
dependent on monsoon rains.
60
RASAYAN LIMITED
35th Annual Report 2023-2024
The warmer and humid climate created due to climate change is creating more horizons for pest
infestations. Those climate-resilient technologies that are technically sound and economically viable
must be framed using an interdisciplinary approach to mitigate climate change. Climate change has
the potential to increase the pest population and its migration, which can have an adverse impact on
agricultural yields and even viability, as the pest population depends mainly on abiotic factors such as
humidity and temperature.
The incidences of hailstorms, cyclones and flashfloods have been increased and have great impact on
agriculture. These challenges have potential to limiting the income of farmers in the country. Climate
smart agriculture should be adopted to minimize the effect of agricultural practices on the environment.
Crop rotation, minimal tillage, integrated approach for minimizing use of chemicals and natural resources,
livestock waste management etc. are some of the practices to be adopted widely. Integrating different
fields of agriculture for using by-products and efficient work will definitely help in reducing some of the
potential effects on environment. Development of relevant irrigation infrastructure will also help in reducing
the effect of possible global warming
OPPORTUNITIES AND OUTLOOK
The industry is closely working with the Government for necessary policy support and on making
agriculture activities even more organized. The transformative agriculture reforms enacted will lead to
faster adoption of necessary technologies across the agriculture value chain and improve the quantity
and quality of the agriculture produce providing growth opportunities to seeds, crop protection and crop
nutrition.
Demand for pesticides continues to be healthy, with the herbicides category continuing to lead the
pack, followed by fungicides.
India is projected to be a key beneficiary of the global move towards 'China plus one' sourcing strategy
of companies, which is expected to provide further momentum to India's crop protection sector. Industry
is collaborating with the Government in building an enabling ecosystem to make India an agrochemical
powerhouse.

RISKS AND CONCERNS
Risk management comprises all the organizational rules and actions for early identification of risks
while doing business and the management of such risks along with identification of opportunities.
Despite the strong growth drivers, Indian agrochemicals industry faces challenges in terms of low
awareness among large number of end users spread across the geography. Managing inventory and
distribution costs is a challenge for the industry players in the wake of volatility in business environment.
The agrochemical industry is highly dependent on weather conditions. The uneven rainfalls affect the
overall business.
The changes and fluctuations in raw material prices due geopolitical tensions, supply chain disruptions,
inflation etc. can be a challenge to growth of the Company.
The performance of the crop protection industry and other agri-inputs is dependent on monsoons, pest
and disease incidences on crops. As this year's monsoon failure has shown, major fluctuations in total
rainfall and its distribution affect the crop acreages and overall productivity and have a direct correlation
with sales. Agrochemical companies face issues due to seasonal nature of demand, unpredictability
of pest attacks and high dependence on monsoons.

Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), standalone Statement of Changes
in Equity and standalone Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended, and notes to the standalone

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, aforesaid

("the Act") in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the Indian Accounting

India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2024, and Standalone profit, Standalone
total comprehensive income, Standalone changes in equity and its Standalone cash flows for the year
ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section
143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described
in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements section of our

our audit of the financial statements under the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 and the Rules
thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical  responsibilities in accordance with these requirements
and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate
to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in
our audit of Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements for the financial year ended March 31, 2024.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements

AUDITORS' RESPONSES
PRINCIPAL 
AUDIT 
PROCEDURES
PERFORMED
We obtained an understanding of the company's
process, policies, and procedures in making the
estimates.
• We understood the revenue recognition
process, 
evaluated 
the 
design 
and
implementation of internal controls relating to
revenue recognized.
• We selected samples and tested the operating
effectiveness of internal controls, relating to
transfer of control. We carried out a
combination of procedures involving enquiry,
observation and inspection of evidence in
respect of operation of these controls.
• We evaluated and tested the design and
operating effectiveness of controls related to
these estimates by studying the market
conditions and obtaining an understanding of
key contractual agreements.
• We tested the relevant information technology
general controls, automated controls, and the
related information used in recording and
disclosing revenue.
In respect of the selected sample of
transactions:
• We obtained the customer contracts and
understood the terms and conditions including
delivery and shipping terms.
• We tested whether the revenue is recognized
upon transfer of control to customer.
• We tested the location wise stocks reports of
the Company, for confirmation on sales
quantity made during the year.
• We tested on a sample basis (including for
sales near to the period end) the
acknowledgments of customers.
• We assessed relevant disclosures in the
standalone financial statements of the
Company.
• We considered the accuracy of management's
estimate in previous years by comparing
historical accrued liabilities with their
subsequent settlement.
KEY AUDIT MATTERS
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Refer to Note 2.11 'Revenue Recognition', Note 36
'Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty' and Note
20 'Revenue from Operations' to the standalone
financial statements.
The management is required to make certain
judgments in respect of revenue recognition.
Revenue from sale of goods is recognized, when
the control of goods is transferred to the customers.
In accordance with the accounting policy, control
is transferred either when the product is delivered
to the customer's site or when the product is
shipped, depending on the applicable terms.
Management is required to consider historical
experience, specific contractual terms, and future
expectations of revenue to determine these
estimates.
Revenue recognition involves significant
management judgements and estimates and has
accordingly been identified as a key audit matter.
Also, factors such as the current and expected
operating environment, the action of third parties
have a significant impact on management's
judgment.

Information Other than the Standalone Financial Statements and Auditor's Report Thereon
•
The Company's management & Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The
other information obtained at the date of this auditor's report is in Director's Report, Corporate
Governance Report, and Management Discussion & Analysis Report, but does not include the
Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements and our auditor's report thereon.
•
Our opinion on Ind AS financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
•
In connection with our audit of the Standalone financial statements, our responsibility is to read
the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially
inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained during the course of our
audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If based on the work we have performed, we
conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report
the fact.  We have nothing to report in this regard.
Management's Responsibility for the Standalone Financial Statements
The Company's Management & Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in Section
134(5) of the Companies Act, 2013, ("the Act") with respect to the preparation of these Standalone
Financial Statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance
(including other comprehensive income), Standalone changes in equity and Standalone cash flows of
the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the
Accounting Standards specified under Section 133 of the Act. This responsibility also includes
maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding
the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection
and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable
and prudent; and design, implementation, and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that
were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records,
relevant to the preparation and presentation of Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements that give a true
and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing Standalone Ind AS financial statements, management & Board of Directors is responsible
for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters
related to going concern, and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either
intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations or has no realistic alternatives but to do so.
 The Board of Directors is also responsible for overseeing the company's financial reporting process.
Auditor's Responsibility for the Audit of Standalone Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements
as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error and to issue an auditor's
report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance. Misstatements
can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these
Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional
skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
•
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to
fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not
detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error,
127
RASAYAN LIMITED
35th Annual Report 2023-2024
as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override
of internal control.
•
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible
for expressing our opinion on whether the Company has an adequate internal financial controls
system in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls
•
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures made by management.
•
Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting
and, based on the audit evidence obtained, we are of the opinion that the company is able to
continue as a going concern. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the
date of our auditor's report.
•
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure, and content of the financials including the disclosures,
and whether Standalone Ind AS financial statements represent the underlying transactions and
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in Standalone Ind AS financial statements that individually
or in aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of
Standalone Ind AS financial statements may be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and
qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and evaluating the results of our work; and
(ii) evaluating the effect of any identified misstatements in the financial statements.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned
scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in
internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant
ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and
other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable,
related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters
that were of most significance in the audit of Standalone Ind AS financial statements of the current
period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report
unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare
circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the
adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest
benefits of such communication.

three years. In accordance with this program, certain properties, plants, equipment, and

during such verification. In our opinion, this periodicity of physical verification is reasonable
having regard to the size of the company and the nature of its assets.

by the Management at reasonable intervals during the year. For goods-in-transit, bill of
lading/subsequent evidence of receipts has been linked with inventory records. In our opinion,

were not material in the aggregate for each class of inventory.

35th Annual Report 2023-2024
ANNEXURE-B TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
ON STANDALONE IND AS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF BHARAT RASAYAN LIMITED
REPORT ON THE INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS UNDER CLAUSE (I) OF SUB-SECTION 3
OF SECTION 143 OF THE COMPANIES ACT, 2013 ("THE ACT") AS REFERRED TO IN
PARAGRAPH 2(F) OF 'REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS'
We have audited the internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements of
BHARAT RASAYAN LIMITED ("the Company") as of March 31, 2024, in conjunction with our audit of
Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements of the Company for the year ended on that date.
Management's Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls
The company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls
based on the internal control with reference to Standalone Financial Statements criteria established by
the company considering the essential components of internal controls stated in the Guidance Note
on Audit of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India ("ICAI'). These responsibilities included the
design, implementation, and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating
effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to accuracy
and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information,
as required under the Companies Act, 2013.
Auditors Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's Internal Financial Controls over financial
reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit
of Internal Financial Controls With reference to financial statements(the "Guidance Note") and the
Standards on Auditing, issued by ICAI and deemed to be prescribed under section 143 (10) of the
Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls, both applicable
to an audit of Internal Financial Controls and, essential components stated in Guidance Note issued
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require
that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements
was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our Audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal
financial control system with reference to Standalone Financial Statements and their operating
effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Ind AS Financial
Statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting,
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal controls based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the
auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risk of material misstatement of the financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidences we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
our audit opinion on the Company's internal financial controls system over financial reporting.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting
A company's internal financial control with reference to Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial controls with reference to
Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements  includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of records in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
135
RASAYAN LIMITED
35th Annual Report 2023-2024
of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditure of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to
error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial
controls with reference to Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements to future periods are subject to the
risk that the internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls
system with reference to Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements  and such internal financial controls
with reference to Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements  were operating effectively as at Mar 31,
2024, based on the internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements
criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal controls stated
in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting  issued by the
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.

assessment of whether the lease transfers substantially all the risk and rewards incidental
to the ownership of the underlying asset. If this is the case, then the lease is a finance lease,
if not then it is an operating lease. As part of the assessment, the Company considers
certain indicators such as whether the lease is for the major part of the economic life of the
asset.

period attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of equity shares
outstanding during the period. The weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during
the period are adjusted for events of bonus issue and share split. For the purpose of calculating

2.18 Fair Value Measurement
Company measures certain financial instruments at fair value at each reporting date. Fair value is
the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on
the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:
i.
in the principal market for the asset or liability, or
ii.
In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to the company. The fair value
of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use
150
RASAYAN LIMITED
35th Annual Report 2023-2024
when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best
interest. The company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and
for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximizing the use of relevant observable
inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs.
Assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are
categorized within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input
that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:
-
Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
-
Level 2 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair
value measurement is directly or Indirectly observable.
-
Level 3 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair
value measurement is unobservable.
2.19 Dividend to Equity Shareholders
Dividend paid/payable is recognized in the year in which the related dividends are approved by
shareholders and recommended by Board of Directors.
2.20 Financial Instruments
Initial recognition and measurement
Financial assets and liabilities are recognized when the Company becomes a party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument. All financial assets and liabilities are initially recognized
at fair value. However, trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component are
initially measured at transaction price.
Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and
financial liabilities, that are not at fair value through profit or loss, are added to or deducted from
the fair value measured on initial recognition of financial asset or financial liability.
a.
Subsequent measurement
Financial Assets
Financial assets are classified in following categories:
a)
At Amortized Cost
A financial asset shall be measured at amortised cost if both of the following conditions
are met:
(i)
the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial
assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and
(ii)
The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows
that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
Financial assets measured at amortised cost using effective interest rate method less
impairment if any. The EIR amortisation is included in finance income in the statement
of profit and loss.
b)
At fair value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI)
A debt instrument’ is classified as at the FVTOCI if both of the following criteria are
met:
•
The objective of the business model is achieved both by collecting contractual cash
flows and selling the financial assets, and
•
The asset’s contractual cash flows represent SPPI.
Debt instruments included within the FVTOCI category are measured initially as well as at
each reporting date at fair value. Fair value movements are recognised in the other
151
RASAYAN LIMITED
35th Annual Report 2023-2024
comprehensive income (OCI). However, the company recognizes interest income, impairment
losses & reversals and foreign exchange gain or loss in the P&L. On de-recognition of the
asset, cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from the equity to
P&L. Interest earned is recognised using the EIR method.
c)
At Fair Value Through Profit and Loss (FVTPL)
FVTPL is a residual category for financial Assets. Any financial assets, which does not
meet the criteria for categorization as at amortized cost or as FVTOCI, is classified as at
FVTPL.
In addition, the company may elect to designate financial asset, which otherwise meets
amortized cost or FVTOCI criteria, as at FVTPL. If doing so reduces or eliminates a
measurement or recognition inconsistency. The company has not designated any financial
asset as at FVTPL.
Financial assets included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all
changes recognised in the P&L.
Financial liabilities
a)
Financial liabilities at Amortized Cost
Financial liabilities at amortised cost represented by trade and other payables, security
deposits and retention money are initially recognised at fair value, and subsequently carried
at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method.
b)
Financial liabilities at FVTPL
The company has not designated any financial liabilities at FVTPL.
c)
Derecognition
Financial Asset
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar
financial assets) is derecognised only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the
asset expires or it transfers the financial assets and substantially all risks and rewards of
the ownership of the asset.
Financial Liability
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or
cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the
same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially
modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a de-recognition of the original
liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying
amounts is recognised in the income statement.
d)
Impairment of financial assets:
Company applies expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement and recognition of
impairment loss. The Company follows' simplified approach' for recognition of impairment
loss allowance on trade receivable. The application of simplified approach does not require
the Company to track changes in credit risk. Rather, it recognises impairment loss allowance
based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date, right from its initial recognition.
Company assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses associated with
its assets carried at amortised cost and FVTOCI debt instruments. The impairment
methodology applies on whether there has been significant increase in credit risk.
ECL impairment loss allowance (or reversal) recognised during the period is recognised as
income/expense in the statement of profit and loss.

(h) Sensitivity Analysis:
The above sensitivity analysis is based on a change in an assumption while holding all other
assumptions constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions
may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant
actuarial assumptions the same method (projected unit credit method) has been applied as when
calculating the defined benefit obligation recognised within the statement of financial position.

("the Act") in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the Indian Accounting

state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2024, and Consolidated profit, Consolidated total
comprehensive income, Consolidated changes in equity and its Consolidated cash flows for the year
ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section
143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described
in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our

AUDITORS' RESPONSES
PRINCIPAL 
AUDIT 
PROCEDURES
PERFORMED
We obtained an understanding of the company's
process, policies, and procedures in making the
estimates.
• We understood the revenue recognition
process, 
evaluated 
the 
design 
and
implementation of internal controls relating to
revenue recognized.
• We selected samples and tested the operating
effectiveness of internal controls, relating to
transfer of control. We carried out a
combination of procedures involving enquiry,
observation and inspection of evidence in
respect of operation of these controls.
• We evaluated and tested the design and
operating effectiveness of controls related to
these estimates by studying the market
conditions and obtaining an understanding of
key contractual agreements.
• We tested the relevant information technology
general controls, automated controls, and the
related information used in recording and
disclosing revenue.
• In respect of the selected sample of
transactions:
•
We obtained the customer contracts and
understood the terms and conditions
including delivery and shipping terms.
•
We tested whether the revenue is
recognized upon transfer of control to
customer.
•
We tested the location wise stocks reports
of the Company, for confirmation on sales
quantity made during the year.
•
We tested on a sample basis (including for
sales near to the period end) the
acknowledgments of customers.
• We assessed relevant disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements of the
Company.
• We considered the accuracy of management's
estimate in previous years by comparing
historical accrued liabilities with their
subsequent settlement.
KEY AUDIT MATTERS
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Refer to Note 2.11 'Revenue Recognition', Note 36
'Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty' and Note
20 'Revenue from Operations' to the consolidated
financial statements.
The management is required to make certain
judgments in respect of revenue recognition.
Revenue from sale of goods is recognized, when
the control of goods is transferred to the customers.
In accordance with the accounting policy, control
is transferred either when the product is delivered
to the customer's site or when the product is
shipped, depending on the applicable terms.
Management is required to consider historical
experience, specific contractual terms, and future
expectations of revenue to determine these
estimates.
Revenue recognition involves significant
management judgements and estimates and has
accordingly been identified as a key audit matter.
Also, factors such as the current and expected
operating environment, the action of third parties
have a significant impact on management's
judgment.

35th Annual Report 2023-2024
Information Other than the Consolidated Financial Statements and Auditor's Report Thereon
•
The Company's management & Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The
other information obtained at the date of this auditor's report is in Director's Report, Corporate
Governance Report, and Management Discussion & Analysis Report, but does not include the
Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements and our auditor's report thereon.
•
Our opinion on Ind AS financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
•
In connection with our audit of the Consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read
the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially
inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained during the course of our
audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If based on the work we have performed, we
conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report
the fact.  We have nothing to report in this regard.
Management's Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements
The Company's Management & Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in Section
134(5) of the Companies Act, 2013, ("the Act") with respect to the preparation of these Consolidated
Financial Statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance
(including other comprehensive income), Consolidated changes in equity and Consolidated cash flows
of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the
Accounting Standards specified under Section 133 of the Act. This responsibility also includes
maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding
the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection
and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable
and prudent; and design, implementation, and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that
were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records,
relevant to the preparation and presentation of Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements that give a
true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing Consolidated Ind AS financial statements, management & Board of Directors is responsible
for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters
related to going concern, and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either
intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations or has no realistic alternatives but to do so.
 The Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the company's financial reporting process.
Auditor's Responsibility for the Audit of Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether Consolidated Ind AS Financial
Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error and to issue
an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate,
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of
these Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional
skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
•
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to
fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not
detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error,
as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override
of internal control.
189
RASAYAN LIMITED
35th Annual Report 2023-2024
•
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible
for expressing our opinion on whether the Company has an adequate internal financial controls
system in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
•
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures made by management.
•
Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting
and, based on the audit evidence obtained, we are of the opinion that the company is able to
continue as a going concern. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the
date of our auditor's report.
•
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure, and content of the financials including the disclosures,
and whether Consolidated Ind AS financial statements represent the underlying transactions and
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in Consolidated Ind AS financial statements that individually
or in aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of
Consolidated Ind AS financial statements may be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and
qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and evaluating the results of our work; and
(ii) evaluating the effect of any identified misstatements in the financial statements.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned
scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in
internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant
ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and
other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable,
related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters
that were of most significance in the audit of Consolidated Ind AS financial statements of the current
period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report
unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare
circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the
adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest
benefits of such communication.

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS" OF OUR REPORT OF EVEN DATE FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31ST

details and situation of property, plant, equipment, and investment properties;
(b)
The Company has a regular programme of physical verification of its property, plant, equipment,
and investment properties by which these are verified in a phased manner over a period of
three years. In accordance with this program, certain properties, plants, equipment, and
investment properties were verified during the year and no material discrepancies were noticed
during such verification. In our opinion, this periodicity of physical verification is reasonable
having regard to the size of the company and the nature of its assets.
(c)
According to the information and explanations given to us and on the basis of our examination
of the records of the company, the title deeds comprising all immovable properties of land
and buildings, which are freehold, are held in the name of the company as at balance sheet

and disclosed as fixed assets in the consolidated financial statements, the lease agreements/

(a)
As explained to us, the inventories, except for goods in transit have been physically verified
by the Management at reasonable intervals during the year. For goods-in-transit, bill of
lading/subsequent evidence of receipts has been linked with inventory records. In our opinion,
the frequency of such verification is reasonable and the procedure and coverage followed by
the management is appropriate. The discrepancies noticed during such physical verification
were not material in the aggregate for each class of inventory.
(b)

of the records of the company, the company has been sanctioned limits exceeding Rs 5

RASAYAN LIMITED
35th Annual Report 2023-2024
ANNEXURE-B TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
ON CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF BHARAT RASAYAN LIMITED
REPORT ON THE INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS UNDER CLAUSE (I) OF SUB-SECTION 3
OF SECTION 143 OF THE COMPANIES ACT, 2013 ("THE ACT") AS REFERRED TO IN
PARAGRAPH 2(F) OF 'REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS'
We have audited the internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements of
BHARAT RASAYAN LIMITED ("the Company") as of March 31, 2024, in conjunction with our audit of
Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements of the Company for the year ended on that date.
Management's Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls
The company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls
based on the internal control with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements criteria established
by the company considering the essential components of internal controls stated in the Guidance
Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India ("ICAI'). These responsibilities included the
design, implementation, and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating
effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to accuracy
and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information,
as required under the Companies Act, 2013.
Auditors Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's Internal Financial Controls over financial
reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit
of Internal Financial Controls With reference to financial statements(the "Guidance Note") and the
Standards on Auditing, issued by ICAI and deemed to be prescribed under section 143 (10) of the
Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls, both applicable
to an audit of Internal Financial Controls and, essential components stated in Guidance Note issued
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require
that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements
was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our Audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal
financial control system with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements and their operating
effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Ind AS Financial
Statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting,
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal controls based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the
auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risk of material misstatement of the financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidences we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
our audit opinion on the Company's internal financial controls system over financial reporting.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting
A company's internal financial control with reference to Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial controls with reference to
Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements  includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
the maintenance of records  in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
197
RASAYAN LIMITED
35th Annual Report 2023-2024
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditure of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to
error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial
controls with reference to Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements to future periods are subject to
the risk that the internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls
system with reference to Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements  and such internal financial controls
with reference to Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements  were operating effectively as at Mar 31,
2024, based on the internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements
criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal controls stated
in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting  issued by the
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.

with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind-AS) notified under section 133 of the Companies Act 2013
and Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 as amended from time to time.
All assets and liabilities have been classified as current or non-current as per the Company's
normal operating cycle and other criteria as set out in the Division II of Schedule-III to the Companies
Act, 2013. Based on the nature of the products and the time between purchase of materials for
processing and their realisation in cash and cash equivalents, the Company has ascertained its
operating cycle as 12 months for the purpose of current or non-current classification of assets and
liabilities.
2.2 Basis of Measurement
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and on an
accrual basis, except for the following item that have been measured at fair value as required by
relevant Ind-AS.
a. Employee defined benefit plan.
b. Certain financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value.
2.3 Use of Estimates and Judgement
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires management to make
judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
financial statements and the reported amount of income and expenses. Examples of such estimates
includes future obligations under employee retirement benefit plans and estimated useful life of
property, plant and equipment, Employee benefit expenses, provisions etc. Actual results may
differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on a periodic basis. Future results could
differ due to changes in these estimates and difference between the actual result and the estimates
are recognised in the period in which the results are known /materialized.
2.4 Basis of Consolidation
Joint Ventures
A Joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby parties that have joint control of the arrangement
have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Interests in joint ventures are initially recognised
at cost and thereafter accounted for using the equity method.
207
RASAYAN LIMITED
35th Annual Report 2023-2024
Equity Method
Under the equity method of accounting, the investments are initially recognised at cost and
adjusted thereafter to recognise the group’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses of the
investee in profit and loss, and the group’s share of other comprehensive income of the investee in
other comprehensive income. Dividends received or receivable from joint ventures are recognised
as a reduction in the carrying amount of the investment.
When the group’s share of losses in an equity-accounted investment equals or exceeds its
interest in the entity, including any other unsecured long-term receivables, the group does not
recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the
other entity.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the group and its joint ventures are eliminated to the
extent of the group’s interest in these entities. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the
transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
The carrying amount of equity accounted as investments are tested for impairment in accordance
with the Group's policy.
Any gain or loss on dilution arising on a reduced stake in the joint venture, but still retaining the
joint control, is recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
2.5 Statement of Cash Flow
Cash flows are reported using the indirect method, whereby profit / (loss) before tax is adjusted for
the effects of transactions of non-cash nature and any deferrals or accruals of past or future cash
receipts or payments. The cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities of the
Company are segregated based on the available information.
For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand,
cash at banks and demand deposits with banks, net of outstanding bank overdrafts that are
repayable on demand which are considered part of the Company’s cash management system.
The company has adopted the amendment to Ind-AS 7, which require  the entities to provide
disclosures that enable users of financial Statements to evaluate changes in liabilities arising
from financing activities, including both changes arising from cash flows and non-cash changes,
suggesting inclusion of a reconciliation between the opening and closing balances in the Balance
Sheet for liabilities arising from financing activities, to meet the disclosure requirement. The adoption
of amendment did not have any material effect on the financial statements.
2.6 Functional and Presentation Currency

environment in which the Company operates (Functional Currency) The financial statements are
presented in Indian Rupee (INR), which is functional as well as presentation currency of company.

assessment of whether the lease transfers substantially all the risk and rewards incidental
to the ownership of the underlying asset. If this is the case, then the lease is a finance lease,
if not then it is an operating lease. As part of the assessment, the Company considers
certain indicators such as whether the lease is for the major part of the economic life of the

2.19 Fair Value Measurement
Company measures certain financial instruments at fair value at each reporting date. Fair value is
the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on
the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:
i.
in the principal market for the asset or liability, or
ii.
In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or
liability.
The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to the company. The fair value
of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use
when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best
interest. The company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and
for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximizing the use of relevant observable
inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs.
Assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are
categorized within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input
that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:
- Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
- Level 2 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement is directly or Indirectly observable.
- Level 3 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement is unobservable.
2.20 Dividend to Equity Shareholders
Dividend paid/payable is recognized in the year in which the related dividends are approved by
shareholders and recommended by Board of Directors.
2.21 Financial Instruments
Initial recognition and measurement
Financial assets and liabilities are recognized when the Company becomes a party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument. All financial assets and liabilities are initially recognized
at fair value. However, trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component are
initially measured at transaction price.
Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and
financial liabilities, that are not at fair value through profit or loss, are added to or deducted from
the fair value measured on initial recognition of financial asset or financial liability.
213
RASAYAN LIMITED
35th Annual Report 2023-2024
a.
Subsequent measurement
Financial Assets
Financial assets are classified in following categories:
a)
At Amortized Cost
A financial asset shall be measured at amortised cost if both of the following conditions
are met:
(i)
the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial
assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and
(ii)
The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows
that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
Financial assets measured at amortised cost using effective interest rate method less
impairment if any. The EIR amortisation is included in finance income in the statement
of profit and loss.
b)
At fair value through Other Comprehensive Income
A debt instrument’ is classified as at the FVTOCI if both of the following criteria are met:
•
The objective of the business model is achieved both by collecting contractual cash
flows and selling the financial assets, and
•
The asset’s contractual cash flows represent SPPI.
Debt instruments included within the FVTOCI category are measured initially as well as at
each reporting date at fair value. Fair value movements are recognised in the other
comprehensive income (OCI). However, the company recognizes interest income, impairment
losses & reversals and foreign exchange gain or loss in the P&L. On de-recognition of the
asset, cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from the equity to
P&L. Interest earned is recognised using the EIR method.
c)
At Fair Value Through Profit and Loss
FVTPL is a residual category for financial Assets. Any financial assets, which does not
meet the criteria for categorization as at amortized cost or as FVTOCI, is classified as at
FVTPL.
In addition, the company may elect to designate financial asset, which otherwise meets
amortized cost or FVTOCI criteria, as at FVTPL. If doing so reduces or eliminates a
measurement or recognition inconsistency. The company has not designated any financial
asset as at FVTPL.
Financial assets included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all
changes recognised in the P&L.
Financial liabilities
a)
Financial liabilities at Amortized Cost
Financial liabilities at amortised cost represented by trade and other payables, security
deposits and retention money are initially recognised at fair value, and subsequently carried
at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method.
b)
Financial liabilities at FVTPL
The company has not designated any financial liabilities at FVTPL.
214
RASAYAN LIMITED
35th Annual Report 2023-2024

Financial Asset
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar
financial assets) is derecognised only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the
asset expires or it transfers the financial assets and substantially all risks and rewards of
the ownership of the asset.
Financial Liability
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or
cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the
same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially
modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a de-recognition of the original
liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying
amounts is recognised in the income statement.
d)
Impairment of financial assets:
Company applies expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement and recognition of
impairment loss. The Company follows' simplified approach' for recognition of impairment
loss allowance on trade receivable. The application of simplified approach does not require
the Company to track changes in credit risk. Rather, it recognises impairment loss allowance
based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date, right from its initial recognition.
Company assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses associated with
its assets carried at amortised cost and FVTOCI debt instruments. The impairment
methodology applies on whether there has been significant increase in credit risk.
ECL impairment loss allowance (or reversal) recognised during the period is recognised as
income/expense in the statement of profit and loss.

The above sensitivity analysis is based on a change in an assumption while holding all other
assumptions constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions
may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant
actuarial assumptions the same method (projected unit credit method) has been applied as when
calculating the defined benefit obligation recognised within the statement of financial position.
