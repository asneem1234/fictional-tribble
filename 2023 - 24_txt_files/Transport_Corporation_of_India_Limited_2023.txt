3.	 Describe the mechanisms to receive and redress grievances of the community         
	
The Company’s approach to managing community grievances follows the precautionary principle of identifying and resolving the 
concerns of the community through Community Grievance Mechanism. It is a process for systematically receiving, investigating, 
responding to, and closing out grievances from affected communities in a timely, fair and consistent manner. Our grievance management 
system aims to be based on dialogue with our stakeholders first and foremost and to resolve issues in a non-judicial manner. A step- 
wise mechanism has been adopted to resolve grievances on priority basis.
	
1.	
Receipt & Acknowledgement
	
	
Grievances may be written or verbal and in local languages. They can by lodged by email, phone, by the community directly 
or through staff working locally, and other locally dedicated channels, as well as at corporate level. The grievances can be 
submitted anonymously, as well as on behalf of another individual. Each grievance is acknowledged once received, and the 
complainant is informed of the next steps.
	
2.	
Assessment & Assignment
	
	
Once a grievance is received, it will be assessed for its severity and assigned to Director Community Engagement/ TCI 
Foundation, who will follow through to ensure that the issue is investigated by divisions that are best suited to do so, and that 
the complainant is responded to in due course. Grievances with high severity levels are escalated to senior management levels.
	
3.	
Investigation & Information
	
	
The Director Community Engagement/ TCI Foundation and the respective departments investigate the grievance and respond 
to the complainant informing them about the proposed resolution. In some cases, more information may be requested from the 
complainant to ensure a thorough investigation.
	
4.	
Resolution
	
	
The Company prefers that community grievance be resolved based on dialogue where a resolution can be found together with 
the complainant. Remedies may be proposed depending on the case. If the solution is unacceptable to the grieved community, 
it can be appealed, in such case the grievance will be re-evaluated by alternate investigators. Once the complainant accepts the 
resolution, the grievance is considered resolved.
