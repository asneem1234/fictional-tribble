Waste acid coming from the pickling line is 
regenerated and then used to fill the demand 
for fresh acid. Furthermore, the majority of 
effluents from the pickling line can be 
eliminated, thus saving costs for the entire 
pickling process and minimizing the 
environmental impact. 
Through this process the 
company will reduce 60 to 
80 % pickling load at ETP 
and the same will recover 
and reuse for gardening, 
as a water conservation 
initiative.
