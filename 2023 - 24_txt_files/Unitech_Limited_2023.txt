BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITY & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023-24
SECTION - A: GENERAL DISCLOSURES
Introduction:
(a)	
Unitech Limited (Unitech or the Company), was 
incorporated on 09th February, 1971 under the 
Companies Act, 1956, and commenced its operations. 
It has been one of the leading real estate companies 
in India, with a well-diversified presence in real estate 
business comprising of commercial complexes and 
integrated residential development, Schools, Hotels, 
Malls and infrastructure projects. Unitech has projects 
across the price spectrum and several states in India.
(b)	
The Company went through challenging times 
sometime around 2012-13 onwards due to various 
factors which led to a situation that it was not able to 
honour the commitments made to customers for timely 
delivery of the residential and commercial units sold to 
them. Due to numerous litigations by a large number 
of homebuyers and other stakeholders, the Hon’ble 
Supreme Court directed the Union Government vide its 
Order dated 18.12.2019 to propose the appointment of 
an independent Board of Directors of Unitech Limited. 
(c)	
In compliance thereto, the Central Government 
proposed the constitution of a new Board of Directors, 
which was approved by the Hon’ble Supreme Court 
vide its Order dated 20.01.2020 passed in the matter 
of Bhupinder Singh Vs. Unitech Limited in Civil Appeal 
No. 10856/2016. The Hon’ble Supreme Court was also 
pleased to direct the supersession of the erstwhile 
Management of Unitech Limited and its affiliates 
with the appointment of a new Board of Directors 
constituted under the chairmanship of Mr. Y. S. Malik, 
IAS (Retd.), formerly Secretary to Government of India. 
(d)	
The order inter alia, stated that - 
	
	
“The existing Board of Directors of Unitech Limited 
is superseded with immediate effect in order to 
facilitate the taking over of management by the 
new Board of Directors constituted in terms of the 
proposal submitted by the Union Government.”
(e)	
In compliance of the order ibid, the new Management, 
as directed, prepared and submitted a Resolution 
Framework (RF) before the Hon’ble Supreme Court 
on 16.07.2020, followed by updated versions filed on 
05.02.2021 and 08.08.2022, wherein a comprehensive 
approach for (i) completion of all incomplete projects, 
(ii) settlement of all other stakeholders has been 
proposed. The said RF is under consideration of the 
Hon’ble Supreme Court.
(f)	
Further, the Hon’ble Supreme Court had requested 
Justice (Retd.) A. M. Sapre, vide its order dated 
20.04.2022, to assist the Board of Management in 
monetization of the land assets under the auspices of 
the directions of Hon’ble Supreme Court. Subsequently, 
vide the order dated 18.05.20222, Justice (Retd.) 
A.M. Sapre was also associated with every stage of 
tendering process and that the same be carried out 
under his supervision. 
(g)	
It is pertinent to note that in view of the legacy issues 
confronting Unitech Group of Companies, several 
Unitech’s Projects had been lying stalled since even 
before June 2017 when the promoters were sent to jail. 
(h)	
Based on the ground-work done by PMCs, it was 
estimated that about 130-135 Tenders would be 
required to be floated for completion of all the 74 
residential and 12 commercial projects. Since, it was 
practically not possible to float all the Tenders in one 
go, the Management decided to float these Tenders 
in four to five Lots, each Lot comprising about 30-35 
Tenders, as also submitted before the Hon’ble Supreme 
court vide ATR-IV. As the Members are already aware, 
the Unitech Management after seeking the approval of 
the BoD and Justice (Retd.) A.M. Sapre in the month of 
December 2022, floated a total of 35 Tenders as part 
of Lot-1 on 02.01.2023. After the completion of Bid 
Management process and approval of BoD and Justice 
Sapre, a total of 15 Tenders were submitted to the 
Hon’ble Supreme Court seeking directions for award 
of Contracts. Further, after the approval of BoD and 
Justice (Retd.) A.M. Sapre, the Management floated 
another set of 51 Tenders as part of Lot-2 on its website 
on 08.05.2023 and 09.05.2023. After the completion 
of Bid Management Process for Lot-2 Tenders, a 
total of 34 Tenders were approved by the BoD and 
Justice Sapre on 18.08.2023, and the same were 
submitted in the Hon’ble Supreme Court for seeking 
their approval for awarding the Contracts to successful 
Bidders. The Hon’ble Supreme Court permitted the 
Unitech Management to award contracts in respect of 
49 (15+34) Tenders qua Lot-1 & Lot-2 vide its orders 
dated 03.11.2023. In furtherance to the aforesaid order 
dated 03.11.2023, the Management uploaded the list of 
these approved 49 Tenders at the Company’s website 
on 04.11.2023 and issued Letters of Intent (LoIs) to all 
the 23 Contractors to whom 49 Tenders of 39 Projects 
were awarded to comply with the requisite formalities 
for signing the Contract Agreements. Simultaneously, 
after seeking the approval of the BoD in its meeting 
held on 26.10.2023, the company floated another set of 
55 Tenders as part of Lot-3 on 07.11.2023/ 08.11.2023. 
After the completion of Bid Management Process for 
Lot-3 Tenders, a total of 38 Tenders were approved by 
BoD and Justice Sapre on 16.02.2024 and the same 
were submitted in the Hon’ble Supreme Court for 
approval for award of Contracts to successful Bidders, 
which was allowed by the Hon’ble Court vide its orders 
dated 26.04.2024. Accordingly, the process for award 
of contracts in respect of the Lot-3, invitation of tenders 
for Lot-4 and Lot-5 Tenders has been continuing.

BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITY & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023-24
(i)	
Separately, keeping in view that the works on various 
structures of buildings left incomplete by the erstwhile 
management had been lying stalled for a number of 
years, it was decided to get the Health Safety Audit of all 
these buildings carried out from institutes of eminence. 
The Hon’ble Supreme Court was also apprised about 
the same through Action Taken Report – III.  Services 
of IIT Roorkee were availed for this purpose for all 
the under-construction buildings within NCR area, IIT 
Madras for the projects at Bangalore and Chennai, and 
Jadhavpur University for Kolkata based projects. In the 
process, the Heath Safety Audit and proof-checking 
of structure designs of a total of 179 Towers and 13 
basements were carried out in respect of 27 Projects. 
While the buildings have been found largely safe, the 
experts have pointed out the need for carrying out 
Retrofitting works to address the deficiencies observed 
during these tests. Accordingly, a total of 28 Tenders 
were floated for the Retrofitting Works along with the 
general Lot-3 Tenders. Contracts have been awarded 
in case of 25 Tenders pursuant to the approval of the 
BoD, Justice Sapre and the Hon’ble Supreme Court. 
The left over 07 Tenders have also been invited and 
the same are under process of technical and financial 
evaluation. Reports of the concerned institutes have 
also been uploaded on the Company’s website. 
(j)	
Award of contracts for commencement of construction 
is only one of the important milestones in the process 
of completion of projects. There are numerous other 
statutory obligations like Renewal of Licenses (in 
case of Haryana and Punjab based projects), Fire 
NOCs, NOCs from the Airport Authority of India 
(wherever applicable), Revalidation and approval of 
the Building Plans, preparation of cases for obtaining 
Environmental Clearances and thereafter obtaining 
the Consents to Establish (CTEs) from the concerned 
statutory authorities are equally onerous tasks. The 
new management has been working on obtaining all 
these statutory approvals in parallel and succeeded to 
a considerable extent. There are still projects where the 
Contracts have been awarded but the works on ground 
have not been commenced on account of pendency 
of these approvals. The management is aggressively 
working on all these fronts.  
(k)	
The new management, working under the overall 
guidance and supervision of Hon’ble Supreme 
Court, is committed to fulfilling the statutory and 
contractual obligations of the Company to adhere to 
the Sustainability and Economic Responsibilities of 
the Company’s business for Environmental, Social and 
Governance aspects.  
(l)	
The recently revised format for BRSR is very exhaustive 
and requires details/ information which are not part 
of the normal data collection and reporting systems 
at the corporate level. Thus, the new format of BRSR 
necessitates establishing rigorous documentation 
processes and comprehensive data collection system 
across all the sites and departments of the Company, 
to ensure seamless compilation and flow of details 
for effective and accurate reporting. It also requires 
exhaustive training to employees at all levels of 
hierarchy, for a comprehensive understanding of the 
ESG objectives.
(m)	 It is pertinent to note that the proposed Resolution 
Framework (RF) is pending adjudication before the 
Hon’ble Supreme Court of India. The Company 
endeavours to take the required measures to upgrade 
the reporting system in line with the proposals 
submitted in the Resolution Framework and directions 
of the Hon’ble Supreme Court from time to time, so 
that the gaps in reporting under the new framework of 
BRSR, may be effectively bridged. All efforts have been 
made to compile the BRSR with the data available, 
which itself remains a challenge in view of complete 
change of management, and a number old employees 
having left the company. 
(n)
