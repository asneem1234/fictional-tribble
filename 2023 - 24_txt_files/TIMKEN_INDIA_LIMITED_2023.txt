supply side (the productive 
potential) and the demand 
side (the consumption and 
investment). 
Timken building its climate resilience 
through innovative designs with more 
recycled materials, Continuous process 
improvements and improve process is 
energy efficient. Focused approach on GHG 
emission reductions. 
Timken’s target is to reduce our aggregate 
Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions intensity by 
50% by 2030 (with base line year 2018). This 
covers direct emissions from our 
operations, and indirect emissions from 
purchased energy. We continue tracking the 
GHG emissions and take necessary action to 
reduce. 
Negative: Increased 
operating costs in 
meeting the 
environmental 
standards.

Management 
(Water 
Consumption and 
Effluent Discharge)
Risk 
Water is one of the most 
important resources for the 
industrial processes in 
different ways. Over 
consuming and pollution are 
posing a major challenge for 
the Water availability.  
Timken adapted Reduce, Recycle, Reuse 
approach for the Water management.  
Conservation: Rain water harvesting 
projects are installed at Jamshedpur and 
initiated at Bharuch plants. 
Reduction: Through efficient operation, 
reduction of water wastage through leaks, 
contamination, evaporation etc being 
controlled. Thus reducing the fresh 
consumption.  
Recycle& Reuse : Both Jamshedpur and 
Bharuch plants are Zero Liquid Discharge 
plants. Through ETP/STPs we treat the used 
water and reuse permeate for internal 
consumption i.e Gardening / Flushing.  
Negative: If not 
managed efficiently.

consumption patterns, identifying areas of 
inefficiency, and determining potential 
areas for improvement 
Implementation: Implementing Energy 
Efficiency Measures such as upgrading 
equipment, optimizing processes, using 
energy-efficient technologies, and 
improving insulation 
Monitoring & Continuous Improvement:

community  
Risk 
Ensuring the health & safety 
of the employees, contract 
workers, and communities is 
critical for continued 
regulatory and social 
importance to operate, 
especially considering 
process related hazards. 
Each safety incident also has 
a negative impact on the 
health, wellbeing, and 
morale of employees along 
with a negative reputational 
impact on the Company. 
We have established several environmental 
health and safety management policies to 
protect our employees.  Offering workplace 
conditions, support systems, and policies to

completing safety risk assessments. Their 
firsthand knowledge of daily operations 
and the specific challenges they face on the 
job is invaluable, comprehensive, and 
insightful evaluation of potential hazards.

ownership and responsibility for safety, 
encouraging them to take an active role in 
proposing and implementing risk-mitigation 
strategies, following Hierarchy of Risk

Diversity and 
Equal Opportunity
Opportunity 
Diversity and inclusion in the 
manufacturing industry 
encompass a broad range of 
dimensions, including 
gender,  age, disability, 
sexual orientation, and 
cultural backgrounds. The 
role of embracing diversity 
in this sector is crucial, 
leading to improved 
innovation, problem-solving, 
and financial performance. A 
diverse workforce in 
manufacturing brings unique 
perspectives and ideas, 
fostering a more inclusive 
and creative environment. 
We review and update our  hiring 
practices to ensure they are inclusive and 
equitable. This includes implementing 
unbiased screening processes to mitigate 
unconscious bias, offering diversity 
training to hiring managers, and actively 
recruiting from diverse talent pools. 
Our unique management policies & 
practices ensures, creating an inclusive 
work culture by promoting open 
communication, respect for diverse 
perspectives, zero tolerance for 
discrimination or harassment, and offering 
employee resource groups or affinity 
networks 
Positive: If 
managed well.

Financial 
Performance of the 
company 
Risk / 
Opportunity 
Achieving exceptional 
financial performance is a 
primary goal for all 
management team due to 
its importance in 
establishing a solid firm & 
facilitating growth. 
However, several factors 
consistently hinder the 
attainment of this objective, 
resulting in adverse effects 
on a Company’s 
performance and financial 
success. Like.. 
Geo-political Scenario: 
Situations like Russia-
Ukraine conflicts, Israel-
Palestine issues are 
At Timken, with the clear focus on 
innovative automations, continuous 
improvements, and adaptation of energy 
efficient processes, we are keep 
improving the efficiency in the operations 
and also use the localized raw materials 
for   manufacturing. We are mitigating the 
risk by reducing the costs while 
maintaining quality on a sustainable basis.
Timken as a group having operations at 
multiple countries, we are countering 
risks arising due geopolitical situations. 
Even problem occurs at one part of the 
world, the Company can depend on 
markets and source products from other 
non-problematic location and can operate 
smoothly.  
Negative: If not 
managed well. 
 
 
disturbing the markets, 
supply chains and increased 
raw material prices etc are 
negatively impacting the 
profitability. 
Currency Exchange 
Fluctuations: Due to various 
pollical scenarios the 
Currency exchanges are 
fluctuating on upwards 
which is causing the Raw 
material prices are on 
increased trend,  
Operating costs: Due to 
inflation, increased energy 
costs and Labour costs 
posing a big challenge to the 
income of the Company. 
8 
Information 
Security and 
Privacy 
Protection 
Risk 
Manufacturing facilities are 
increasingly reliant on 
connected devices and 
systems, like control 
systems, Supervisory 
controls and data 
acquisitions, IOT devices etc.
Any data breach/Cyber 
attack can make devastating 
consequences, including:  
Production disruptions: 
Cyberattacks can disrupt  
operations and halt 
production lines, causing 
operational downtime and 
delays that can lead to 
significant financial losses.  
Data breaches: Sensitive 
data, such as intellectual 
property or customer 
information, could be 
stolen.  
Reputation Damage: A 
cybersecurity breach can 
tarnish a Company’s 
reputation, losing customers 
and business partners.  
Safety hazards: Attacks on 
safety systems could put 
workers and equipment at 
risk.  
Legal Liabilities: Cyber 
threats can expose 
manufacturers to legal 
actions and liabilities from 
affected parties. Regulatory 
authorities may impose fines
and penalties for non-
compliance, which can be 
financially taxing.  
Timken has instituted an enterprise-wide 
information security program which is 
continuously reviewed by our Audit 
Committee. Recognizing that this is an 
evolving and complex space, we perform 
regular assessments of our information 
security program. Specific features include: 
Industry-leading cyber-prevention, 
detection and response tools Annual third-
party system penetration testing Annual 
information security training for all our 
associates — topics include identifying 
phishing attacks and insider threats, 
among other items The purchase of both 
first- and third-party cyber liability 
insurance The Audit Committee receives 
reports on cyber security threats and 
trends regularly with updates on our 
information security program.  
Negative: If not 
managed well.

Sustainable 
Supply Chain 
Risk/ 
Opportunity 
Timken business depends on 
our integrated value chain 
that extends from Steel 
mills, forgers, heat treaters, 
and various indirect material 
suppliers, warehouses, 
channel partners, and 
customers.  
Environment Related: The 
production, transportation, 
storage, and handling of 
materials, etc. have a 
negative impact on the 
environment, including GHG 
emissions. The bearing parts 
manufacturing at our 
suppliers also consumes 
more materials, oils & 
energy has an adverse 
impact on the environment.  
Social Related: Though 
Timken takes strong 
measures towards the 
sustainable products, value 
chain partners with various 
Socio-Economic levels there 
is a potential dilution of ESG 
commitments and goals 
which will impact the 
Timken's ESG goals. 
Environmentally and socially 
responsible supply chain 
practices safeguard the long-
term viability of the business 
and secure a social license to 
operate. Reduced Scope 3 
emission will also have a 
positive reputational impact.
Timken has been aiming for carbon 
neutrality and efforts are being made 
towards this which includes.  
i. 
Encouraging our suppliers for 
increased use of clean energy for 
their processes. 
ii. 
Preference to engagement with 
suppliers who are working towards 
carbon neutrality. 
iii. 
Train & guide the value chain 
partners on the ESG concepts, 
importance, and methodology. 
Regular assessment planned to find 
the gaps in the value chain partners 
processes in alignment with ESG 
goals. 
iv. 
(iv) We have plan to strengthen this 
further by introducing tougher 
supplier scorecards, databases to 
capture supplier information, 
sustainability questionnaires, etc.  
Positive: If managed 
well 
10 
Regulatory 
Compliance 
Risk 
Regulatory compliance is a 
firm’s adherence to laws, 
regulations, guidelines, and 
specifications relevant to its 
business. These regulations 
(Local/National/ 
international) covers a vast 
area of compliance. 
Violations of regulatory 
compliance often result in 
legal punishment/ fines or 
product withdrawal from the 
market. In addition to the 
fines, these violations can 
result in accidents or 
substantial property loss. 
Complying with regulatory 
standards ensures product 
safety and protects the 
equipment, property, and 
Society.  
We have implemented a systematic 
monitoring and auditing system to assess 
ongoing compliance. Regularly review 
processes, documentation, and adherence 
to policies. This step enables the 
identification of potential issues before 
they escalate, ensuring continuous 
compliance improvement. 
 
Negative: If not 
managed well.
