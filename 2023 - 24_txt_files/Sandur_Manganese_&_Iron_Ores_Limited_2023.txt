2. 	 a. Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? 
	
Yes.
b. 	If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?
	
Mining operations do not require sourcing of any raw material. In the case of ferroalloys production, the major 
portion (about 85%) of strategic raw material like manganese ore is from captive mines and is transported 
though road transportation. In the case of coke production, 100% of strategic raw material which is coking 
coal is sourced through importing from different countries. The sustainable sourcing procedure adopted 
for coking coal procurement is by placing orders well in advance to schedule discharge of shipments and 
transportation through trucks/trains to meet consumption requirement. Sourcing of materials other than 
raw materials are from various sources. The Company strives to avail the services of the local vendors.
3. 	 Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the

The Company has obtained authorization from Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) under the 
Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management and Trans boundary Movement) Rules, 2016 for generation, 
storage and safe disposal of the following type of hazardous wastes:
•	
Category 5.1 used waste oil; and
•	
Category 5.2 oil-soaked cotton waste.

flammable. Hence, these wastes are hazardous in nature.
The Company has well defined SOPs for generation, storage and safe disposal of hazardous waste. All waste oil 
generated in the manufacturing process is collected through drain ports and stored in leak proof drum before 
being disposed off to agencies duly authorized for recycling.

Outcome of the 
initiative
1
Renewable Energy - 
Based Power Plant at 
Kudligi
The Company has entered into an equity-based 
agreement with ReNew Green Energy Solutions Private 
Limited and ReNew Sandur Green Energy Private 
Limited and developed a state-of-the-art power plant 
integrating wind and solar energy technologies, which 
commenced operations at the beginning of the FY 2023-
24. This collaboration aimed to generate sustainable 
electricity, marking a significant milestone in advancing 
renewable energy solutions.
During 
the 
reporting 
year, the project alone 
contributed 44.40% to 
the 
Company’s 
overall 
energy 
consumption, 
generating 
a 
total 
of 
7,41,96,127 kWh of green 
energy.
2
Renewable Energy - 
Solar Installations
Solar installations both on-grid and off-grid were 
implemented and maintained at mines to meet 
electricity requirements, while Flat Plate Collector (FPC) 
solar water heating systems, solar streetlights, home 
lighting, and solar pumps were installed at the registered 
office, mines, and residential colonies. Additionally, a 
200 kW on-grid solar installation was added during this 
period.
These 
installations 
generated 4,12,422 kWh 
green 
energy 
during 
FY 2023-24.
3
Clean Energy
Two Waste Heat Recovery Boilers (WHRB), each with a 
capacity of 60 TPH, were installed to generate electricity 
by recovering heat from the waste gas produced by non-
recovery type coke ovens, thereby enhancing energy 
efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions in 
our industrial operations.
In FY 2023-24, a total of 
3,80,52,000 kWh of clean 
energy was generated, 
contributing to 23% of the 
Company’s total energy 
consumption.
4
Installation of Air-
Cooled Condenser 
(ACC)
The air-cooled condenser is a direct dry cooling system 
that utilizes ambient air to extract both the sensible heat 
and latent heat of condensation released by the exhaust 
steam from turbines.
The 
ACC 
has 
approximately one-third 
the water footprint of 
a 
conventional 
Water-
Cooled Condenser (WCC), 
resulting in savings of 
approximately 
2,000 
cubic meters of water per 
day.
5
Installation of Variable 
Frequency Drive (VFD) 
for Induced Draft (ID) 
fans and Forced Draft 
(FD) fans
VFDs are utilized for ID fans and FD fans in power and 
ferroalloy plants to conserve energy. By enabling motors 
to operate at variable speeds, VFDs effectively minimize 
energy 
consumption 
associated 
with 
equipment 
operation, resulting in significant energy savings.
Approximately 
2,000 
kWh of energy per year 
are conserved.
6
Sewage Treatment 
Plant (STP)
Domestic effluent is treated in state-of-the-art Moving 
Bed Biofilm Reactor (MBBR) technology-based Sewage 
Treatment Plant.
This has minimized the 
water footprint through 
efficient 
wastewater 
treatment, resulting in 
a reduction of 36,500 
kilolitres 
in 
freshwater 
consumption during the 
FY 2023-24.
7
Groundwater 
Recharge
The Company has constructed 53 rainwater harvesting 
pits, numerous check dams, and silt settling tanks to 
augment groundwater recharge within its mining lease 
area.
During 
the 
FY 
2023-
24, an estimated 11,871 
kilolitres per day have 
been recharged into the 
groundwater, 
aligning 
with GEC norms and 
making the Company’s 
water positive.
