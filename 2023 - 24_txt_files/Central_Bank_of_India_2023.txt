whether risk or 
opportunity (R/O)
Rationale for identifying the 
risk / opportunity
In case of risk, 
approach to 
adapt or mitigate
Financial 
implications 
of the risk or 
opportunity 
(Indicate positive 
or negative 
implications)
1.
Tie-up with 
Fintech 
companies 
for delivering 
ﬁnancial 
services.
Opportunity
Fintech is enabling and 
empowering the next 
generation of consumers 
who are highly tech-savvy 
and have greater ﬁnancial 
literacy but had a paucity of 
time. These customers can 
avail the services on the go. 
With the enablers like the 
use of Artiﬁcial intelligence 
for credit decisions based 
on algorithms, APIs for 
e-documentation, and 
system integrations any 
bank can excel and deliver 
the desired services and can 
enhance its asset/liabilities 
portfolios.
Though the 
activity has 
inherent risks, 
however with 
appropriate 
risk mitigates in 
place, the risk 
can be reduced 
substantially.
The adoption 
of newer 
technology will 
help any bank to 
provide ﬁnancial 
services across 
the ecosystem 
even without 
having a brick 
and mortar 
structure more 
swiftly and 
enhance its 
asset/liability 
portfolio.
2.
Sustainable 
Development 
Goals 
-“Green Fixed 
Deposits”
Opportunity
Green Deposits will help 
enhance Central Bank of 
India’s participation in 
projects directly supporting 
United Nations’ Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) 
and empower our depositors 
to opt for ﬁnancial products 
that have a positive impact 
on the environment, and the 
society at large.
Green deposit is 
offered at special 
rates which are 
above other ﬁxed 
deposit rates.
Positive: 
Safeguarding 
our environment 
from climate 
change is the 
need of the hour. 
Hence there is 
immense scope 
to increase 
green deposits 
in the country.

Green 
Financing
Opportunity
The government often 
employs SDGs as a 
framework to achieve a more 
sustainable future for all and 
companies are increasingly 
setting the corporate target 
to align with those SDGs.
Encourage dealers to sell 
more electric vehicles 
by providing incentives 
to dealers and sales 
executives.
Charging lower interest 
rates on electrical vehicle 
loans than fossil fuel vehicle 
loans to attract more 
customers.
Access to a 
diversiﬁed pool 
of green ﬁnance 
like water 
management, 
waste 
management, 
affordable 
green housing, 
green vehicle 
ﬁnancing, etc.
Positive:
Immense scope 
to build a larger 
green Portfolio.

and social impacts of product and processes to total R&D and capex investments made by the entity, respectively. 
Not Applicable 
Given the nature of business of the Bank, the relevance of the above is largely restricted to information 
technology (IT) capex. In FY24, Capex incurred towards IT hardware and software, which facilitated the 
enhanced digital initiatives of the Bank was 1.68% of total revenue. Greater adoption of digital platforms 
not only brings in increased efﬁciencies of operations but also ensures substantially reduced consumption
