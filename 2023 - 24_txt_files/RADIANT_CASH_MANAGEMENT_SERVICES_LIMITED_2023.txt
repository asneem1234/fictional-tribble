and 
reduce 
carbon 
emissions. By identifying carbon 
emission as a material topic, 
RCMS 
ensures 
compliance 
with the existing and proposed 
environmental regulations. This 
helps the company avoid legal 
issues and penalties and improves 
its reputation as a responsible 
organization.
In India, the nature of vehicles 
to be used for the cash logistics 
operations 
are 
regulated 
by 
the 
RBI/MHA 
guidelines. 
As 
per current regional regulatory 
compliance, the vehicles in Delhi

instead of conventional fuels like 
Petrol/Diesel. Additionally, steps 
to reduce emissions from the 
cash vehicles are being taken by
