Talent 
Demand and 
Employee 
Attrition Risk
	\ Market forces –
After the great 
resignation 
phase that 
the industry 
faced post 
COVID, the 
talent market 
has been stable 
for last year. 
However, it is 
hard to predict 
how long it 
will last. Any 
change in the 
market force 
may increase 
voluntary 
attrition.
	\ Limited 
talent pool 
in emerging 
technology 
areas – While 
larger talent 
demand has 
stabilized, 
demand for 
emerging 
technologies 
is still high. 
Talent pool 
for the same 
is limited. This 
will continue to 
impact attrition.
	\ Employee 
preferences – 
Hybrid working 
seems to be 
the employee’s 
preference.
Risk
	\ Employee Grooming and Upskilling – Focus 
on employee development and upskilling, 
enabling them to build their careers has been 
a part of the ‘Persistent way’ of working.

competencies. Persistent invests in up-
skilling of its associates in new age digital 
technologies and runs Persistent’s Digital 
Engineering Academy (PDEA). PDEA runs 
upskilling programs in Cloud, Data, Gen AI, 
etc.
	\ Employee engagement and all-round 
wellbeing – All round wellbeing of our 
employee has been central to our employee 
engagement approach, which covers physical, 
financial, and psychological wellbeing. We 
conduct regular surveys to seek input from 
the employees on various aspects of their 
work to understand their engagement and 
expectations. Input thus received is processed 
to make necessary improvements in processes 
and policies.
	\ Persistent brand – our consistent growth over 
the last several quarters, scale of operations, 
geographical presence, and initiatives such 
as GWR (Guinness World Records) has been 
helping us continue to position Persistent as a 
leading brand in the industry. We continue to 
invest in branding initiatives.
	\ Inclusive Workplace - Persistent provides

frequent legal 
updates and 
changes in 
regulatory 
requirements / 
disclosures 
(including 
regulations

Management Discussion and Analysis Report
Market Overview 
The demand environment continues to remain challenging as high level of inflation continues to worry the central banks. 
Geopolitical conditions remain challenging with actual conflicts and serious risk scenarios creating uncertainty for the 
world economy. 2024 will also see a record number of elections in major countries of the world. While the immediate 
macroeconomic impact of these elections is expected to be limited, their outcome will influence the outlook for the
coming year. 
Growth outlook in advanced economies is likely to be feeble as high price level and tight monetary policies dampen new 
investment as well as consumption. Annual inflation rates are expected to stay above target in many major economies.
Overall risks to the growth outlook are thus tilted to the downside. Geopolitics will remain an important risk factor for the 
world economy. In an environment of rather weak growth and falling inflation, major central banks are expected to lower bank 
rates towards later part of 2024. 
During early pandemic years, as companies accelerated their digital transformation efforts, technology industry flourished. 
However during last year, high inflation and elevated interest rates softened global tech spending. It was a turbulent year for 
the tech sector with many leading tech companies announcing layoffs. Despite these challenges, there are hopes for tech 
comeback to be imminent. With economists lowering the assessment of recession risks, there are expectations for tech sector 
to return to modest growth. Tech companies have extended their reach into other industries using digital advancements. 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is anticipated to lead the charge in growth as companies seek AI solutions to increase productivity 
and drive profitability. 
No matter what the macroeconomic outlook looks like, Chief Information Officers must work through the various risks of 
technology and lead their teams to meet or exceed business objectives, and they still have to run efficient and cost effective 
operations that will navigate the Company through this phase.
Company Overview
We are a global solutions company having technical expertise and industry experience of over 30 years. We imagine, design 
and deliver new digital experience, revenue streams and business models to meet rising customer expectations. We are 
focused on staying connected to our clients and employees while building technology solutions. Over last 30+ years, we have

world in powerful and positive way by using the latest technology.

market leaders across industries. 
With our impactful projects, ranging from groundbreaking IoT solutions to cutting edge advancements in cloud computing 
and artificial intelligence, we have been at the forefront of the technology wave that’s shaping the digital landscape.

and are working towards crossing $ 2 Billion within next three years. The journey is being steered by dynamic group of 
professionals. Our client list consists of numerous industry leaders. We were awarded “Most Promising Company of the Year” 
by CNBC-TV18. We have delivered significant shareholder value, with shareholder returns of 1,152.9% over the last 5 years. 
Opportunities & Challenges
Technology industry is in the business of solving everyone else’s problem but tech companies are facing its own issues. The 
IT sector has undergone significant changes since the onset of COVID-19 and technology companies need to prepare for 
the new challenges in the coming years. Firstly, tech businesses have to keep up with all the new lightning changes in the 
technology trends. Secondly, given the difficult economic situation, rising inflation curtails tech spending, which impacts 
demand scenario, though the demand to embrace technology to accelerate business growth has increased. However 
adopting technology comes with unprecedented challenges. In our digital world, adopting emerging technology is a MUST 
for companies to stay competitive. However, potential benefits and risks of new technology is difficult to predict. One way to

balance technology’s potential risk and benefits is encouraging collaboration and promoting the culture of innovation. 
While customer demand is volatile, one of the major challenges is the shortage of skilled talent in the new technologies. It’s a 
significant problem in introduction of innovative technology. To retain existing talent, companies have been offering attractive 
pay packages which has resulted in the elevated salary levels. The global talent shortage has burdened the job market. With 
tech advancement accelerating by the day, it’s possible the problem gets worse. 
Problem in communication between remote workforce and office workforce can have a negative impact on the productivity 
of the entire company. For enhancing productivity, it is important to create a corporate culture where each employee would 
feel like a participant in the work process. 
Another common problem in technology companies is the organisation of internal multicultural communication. When 
the team is made up of different nationalities, it is necessary to develop an inclusive corporate culture. At the same time, 
diversity of the workforce also helps improve productivity and competitiveness. Geographic spread of a business also brings 
in complexity in compliance requirements. Failure to comply with specific regulations result in fines and penalties that can 
paralyse the business. 
Another important threat is of data breach. It affects the financial health and competitive advantage of a business. 
Successful navigation through all these challenges may even open doors for new opportunities. Cyber security, multi-cloud 
operability, and its integration are some of the opportunities that can help drive growth.
Next year looks to be an exciting year for the technology industry. Not only the AI revolution is taking place but there is a 
transition going on from Web2 to Web3 which Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Citibank say is worth 8 to 12 trillion 
dollars. It will be common ground for companies to have digital first strategy where companies will build things digitally 
before they build it physically. There will be many complexities and regulatory compliances which leaders will have to look at 
as they attempt to execute their strategies for growth and innovation. To remain agile will be the key.
Business Strategy
No matter what the company’s size is, today’s business landscape is throwing challenges and disruptions from every direction. 
After a difficult year in tech sector, everyone is hoping for a comeback. There is much less talk on the recession and hence, a 
renewed optimism that we could be entering the recovery stage prevails. 
Economic uncertainty persists, inflation remains stubborn, talent shortage has not been solved. Technical debt is increasing. 
Under such circumstances, a report from Gartner suggest that IT services will be the largest segment of IT spend. Thus tech 
leaders should be prepared to shift strategies to meet these demands. It is expected that majority of the IT enterprise software 
and services companies will integrate Gen AI into their offerings. The fast–paced developments in the world of AI have led to 
much excitement as well as controversy. 
Secondly, increasing data regulation and security standard require new governance standards. The growth of data privacy 
regulations has also elevated consumer expectations about data protection and security. Along with legislative data 
regulations, businesses must meet evolving industry specific compliance standards while also investing in technology strategy 
that implements modern security solutions to keep customer data safe. 
A strategic plan needs to be developed that uses technology initiatives to drive business growth. Resource utilisation should 
be optimised to serve both – high priority business goals and technology ROI. There should be a method to mitigate potential 
risks, including data breach and technology failure and other unforeseen cybersecurity threats. 
Talent Management
Talent management has become a buzzword in the corporate world. Right talent is an important asset and retaining this talent 
is an important task. At Persistent, we make sure that employees with right skill stick with the Company for a longer time. Our 
Human Resource management takes care of recruiting, managing, assessing, developing and maintaining an Organisation’s 
most important resource – i.e. people. Talent management brings together various management initiatives. Our growth 
mindset has also helped us to build a meaningful work culture.
In this fast-changing tech world, work culture is most important. At Persistent, we promote an environment where employees 
feel empowered to collaborate and contribute. All our policies and practices demonstrate our people–first approach. Our 
reflection of core mission and values have helped to find ways to continuously improve and grow putting people at the center. 
Empathy, communication and transparency are the basis of all our interactions with the team. The shift to remote work has 
also made it possible to hire people all around the world which helps to create a diverse environment.

Effective Portion of Cash Flow Hedges
The Company derives a substantial part of its revenues in foreign currency while a major part of its expenses is incurred in 
Indian Rupees. This exposes the Company to the risk of loss due to fluctuations in foreign currency rates.
The following chart shows movement of monthly spot and forward rates of the Rupee against the USD in Financial year
2023-24, indicating the volatility that the currency faced throughout the year:
₹/$ Currency Movement
The Company minimises the foreign currency fluctuation risk as per Company’s Foreign Exchange Risk Management Policy. 
The Company holds plain vanilla forward contracts against expected future receivables in USD to hedge the risk of changes in 
exchange rates.
As per the accounting principles laid down in Ind AS 109 – “Financial Instruments” relating to cash flow hedges, derivative 
financial instruments which qualify for cash flow hedge accounting are fair valued at the balance sheet date and the effective 
portion of the resultant loss/(gain) is debited/(credited) to the hedge reserve under other comprehensive income and the 
ineffective portion is recognised in the statement of profit and loss. Derivative financial instruments are carried as forward 
contract receivable when the fair value is positive and as forward contract payable when the fair value is negative.
Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the statement of 
profit and loss as they arise. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, or terminated, 
or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised 
under other comprehensive income is transferred to the statement of profit and loss when the forecasted transaction occurs 
or affects profit or loss or when a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur.
Accordingly, the Hedge Reserve (net of tax effects) as at March 31, 2024 stood at a credit balance of ₹ 23.85 Million as 
against a debit balance of ₹ (5.76) Million as at March 31, 2023. Please refer “Other Equity” under Statement of Changes in

Exceptional item
In respect of export incentives pertaining to previous periods amounting to ₹ 255.52 Million, which have been refunded 
under protest with interest of ₹ 41.03 Million, aggregating to ₹ 296.55 Million, the Company had filed an application with 
Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT). The Company believes that its services were eligible for the export incentives 
and the dispute is purely an interpretational issue given the highly technical nature. With the intention of avoiding litigation 
and settling the dispute, the Company had applied before the Settlement Commission for settlement of the case and had 
offered to forego ₹ 296.55 Million. The Company had recognised a provision of ₹ 296.55 Million for the quarter ended 31 
December 2022, which was presented as an “exceptional item” in the statement of profit and loss for that period. During the 
year, the Settlement Commission has approved the Company’s application and has settled the liability of ₹ 296.55 Million 
including interest. As the amount has already been provided for in full by the Company, no further adjustment is necessary in 
these financial statements.

Tax expense consists of current tax and deferred tax.
The Company’s two major tax jurisdictions are India and the United States, though the Company also files tax returns in other 
overseas jurisdictions.
The tax expense for the year amounted to ₹ 3,752.84 Million (including tax charge in respect of earlier years of ₹ 73.19 Million) 
against ₹ 3,111.77 Million [including tax charge in respect of earlier years of ₹ (3.54) Million] in the previous year. The deferred 
tax credit for the year was ₹ 211.69 Million against deferred tax debit of ₹ 85.82 Million in the previous year.

Report on Risk Management
Persistent’s Approach to Risk Management 
Persistent has a well-defined Risk Management framework that includes a risk management policy, risk management 
processes, governance, and awareness programmes. Our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) function aims to strengthen 
and embed proactive risk management culture across the organisation. 
The ERM function works closely with the various organisational units and their leadership to facilitate the risk management 
process.
ERM Objectives
\	 Promote an effective risk management system that supports the Company’s growth strategy, business objectives
and ensure resilience to the business dynamics.
\	 Improve institutional decision-making by giving senior management and Board of Directors timely and accurate information 
that helps them better comprehend the risks and possibilities at the enterprise level, and then propose mitigation plans
to achieve the desired objectives.
\	 Enhance the company’s capacity to achieve its legal, regulatory, and policy compliance obligations.
\	 Strengthen the business’s capacity to recognise its most important resources and put strategies in place to protect and 
strengthen them. 
\	 Establish a process to identify and assess risks that may impact the business continuity of the Company and define 
response and recovery plans for such risks. 
\	 Proactively identify potential opportunities and risks to prepare for future breakthroughs and obstacles.
\	 Strengthen the organisation’s capacity to comprehend and control risk exposures and establish a culture of responsible
risk-taking.
\	 Integrate opportunity and risk assessment analysis into the company’s periodic planning procedures (for example, strategic 
planning, annual budget cycle, etc.).
ERM Framework
The Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework adopted by Persistent is mapped as per the ISO Standard 31000:2018 
Risk Management — Guidelines, COSO: ERM — Integrating Strategy and Performance (2017), and the requirements of 
various applicable regulations in India. Our ERM framework is a holistic approach to managing the full range of risks the 
Company faces, especially risks that are critical to its strategic success. The framework provides guidance for identifying, 
assessing, measuring, monitoring, and responding to risks across the enterprise in a way that is aligned with its strategic 
objectives and risk appetite. ERM function reports the risks to the executive leadership and Risk Management Committee 
(RMC) of the Board for their regular oversight.
The responsibility for risk management is shared across the organisation for an effective and consistent process. There are 
dedicated forums involving leadership and ERM function to address operational and contractual risks. 
Below is the risk management process followed at Persistent:
ERM Process Flow
\	 Identifying plausible uncertainties or risks that may impact the successful achievement of functional, organisational, and 
business objectives or threaten the business continuity of the Company. The risks are categorised into financial, operational, 
reputational, regulatory, extended enterprise, strategic, sustainability, and technology for further assessment. 
\	 Analyzing and assessing the potential impact, likelihood and velocity of existing and newly identified risks and determining 
the readiness to manage them.
\	 Evaluating the results of the risk analysis with the established risk criteria and prioritizing them based on criticality to help 
decide on the appropriate risk management strategy.  
Persistent Systems Limited — 34th Annual report FY2023-24. 
All Rights Reserved © 2024.
283
\	 Formulating risk response strategies to evade / prevent / eliminate the root causes of the risks and the occurrence of
risk event, especially in case of key risks. 
\	 Integrating mitigation plans devised by the risk owners in the day-to-day activities and monitoring them closely.
\	 Monitoring and reviewing risks on a periodic basis for continuous risk assessment. 
\	 Re-evaluating the risk environment and the risk events and updating the mitigation plans if necessary. 
\	 Reporting relevant risk information to Risk Management Committee of the Board in a timely manner to provide the 
necessary basis for risk-informed decision-making.
