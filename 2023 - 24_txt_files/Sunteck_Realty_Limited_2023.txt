throughout our supply chain. The Company has a Supplier code of conduct and Materials Policy which outlines 
the expectations of working with suppliers in terms of various ESG concerns. ESG clauses are also incorporated 
in the Company’s agreements with major suppliers/contractors engaged with Sunteck. The Company makes 
every effort to source product locally within a defined boundary from its project site. Local product sourcing 
enables the Company to cut down on the emissions and energy use involved in transporting and storing such 
goods. Moreover, it fosters the facilitation and creation of additional business and job opportunities for local 
vendors and suppliers, thereby generating a positive impact on the local economy. 100% of our inputs were 
sourced from suppliers who are covered by Sunteck’s supplier code of conduct. 
Also, during 2023-24, we locally procured 90% of the materials for our development portfolio with overall 74% 
recycled content materials. To further strengthen our supply chain, we strive to conduct sustainable supply chain 
assessment in the following year to demonstrate greater environmental stewardship and social responsibility.

Additionally, as part of our endeavor to safety and sustainable construction practices, Sunteck Realty Ltd. has 
initiated the removal of bamboo scaffolding from all ongoing construction projects. Recognising the safety risks 
and limitations associated with traditional bamboo scaffolding, we are transitioning to more secure and reliable 
alternatives. This proactive measure not only enhances the safety of our construction sites but also aligns with 
our broader strategy to adopt modern, sustainable building practices.
By implementing advanced scaffolding systems, we can provide a safer working environment for our construction 
teams, reduce the likelihood of accidents, and improve overall project efficiency. This initiative reflects our 
dedication to safeguarding our workforce and upholding the highest standards of safety and sustainability in 
every aspect of our operations. This year, we have taken a significant step by deploying paramedic staff at our 
Naigaon and Vasai construction sites. This proactive safety initiative is designed to provide immediate medical 
assistance and ensure prompt response to any health emergencies that may arise on-site.
The presence of trained paramedics not only enhances the overall safety and well-being of our workers but 
also helps in creating a secure working environment. By prioritising the health and safety of our employees, we 
continue to foster a culture of care and responsibility, reflecting our core values of sustainable and responsible 
development.

stakeholders to communicate anything material.

step approach, which culminated in identifying a final set of material topics. Regular engagement with various 
stakeholders ensures that expectations are identified in a timely manner and are addressed responsibly.

Initiative I: Project Lajja - Sunteck collaborated for this initiative with “Making the Difference” charitable trust 
to confront the taboo surrounding menstruation and empowering girls. Project Lajja represents our concerted 
effort to change this reality. The impact it has had on the lives of these women and girls is difficult to articulate. A 
total of 14 sessions conducted to empower 1,000 adolescent girls across three locations in 14 different schools.

specific focus on creating a supportive environment conducive to addressing their menstrual health needs.
