Notes:
 
 
The Company has formulated a Grievance Redressal policy incorporating various stakeholders’ and grievance 
redressal mechanisms. It is placed on the website of the Company at https://www.mahanagargas.com/MGL-corporate/
investors/policies and Grievance Redressal Policy for employees/ trainees is available on the Company’s intranet to 
address the Grievances, concerns or complaints in a systematic and trustful manner. 
 
 
Further, the Company has a well-defined vigilance framework which provides a platform to the employees, Directors, 
vendors, suppliers, and other stakeholders to lodge their grievances/ complaints.
 
 
The shareholders can directly submit their complaints to Company through  investorrelations@mahanagargas.com or 
to RTA at rnt.helpdesk@linkintime.co.in Further, the Company has empowered a Board-level Stakeholders Relationship 
Committee ("SRC") to examine and redress complaints by shareholders. 
 
 
MGL has set up various online and offline touch points such as 24*7 call centers, website, chatbot, mobile application 
(MGL Connect), social media platform viz., Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp and Instagram to address queries, concerns 
and grievance redressal of large customer base, that customer may use. Complaint can be made through emails, 
physical letters and walk-in to back office and front office also. 
 
 
Further, MGL is also a part of the Centralized Public Grievance Redressal and Monitoring System (CPGRAMS). This 
system is aimed at providing the citizens and the public at large with a platform for redressal of their grievances, where 
complaints are directly received by the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MoP&NG). MGL redress and resolve all 
the complaints received through CPGRAMS.

Financial implications of the 
risk or opportunity (Indicate

implications)
1
Energy 
management
Risk
Under City Gas distribution 
(CGD) 
sector 
where 
compressors 
consume 
substantial 
power 
for 
compression 
of 
natural 
gas to dispense it as 
CNG, 
inefficient 
energy 
management can lead to 
increase in operational cost. 
Energy utilized for office air 
conditioning system is also 
an important factor.
Some of the important initiatives undertaken 
by the Company for energy management at its 
premises are listed below:
 
 
Maintaining electrical power factor of 
electrical systems at all CNG stations at 
desired level (close to unity) to operate the 
system at best efficiency.
 
 
Installation of stationary cascades of 
adequate capacity at every CNG station to 
provide buffer and reduce number of start/ 
stops and idle running of CNG compressor.
 
 
Installation of solar power panels at MGL 
offices and gas receiving stations.
 
 
Most offices of the Company are equipped 
with LED lights for energy saving.
Energy Management serves 
as a Risk and has a potential 
negative implication on the 
Company. However, due to 
various 
energy 
efficiency 
initiatives 
undertaken, 
the 
negative implication is minimal.

The Company has also installed smart 
switching device for energy management at 3 
CNG ROs. These fault identification and error 
diagnostic equipment help the Company 
to rectify the issue before any incident and 
lowering the energy consumption.
 
 
MGL has implemented UFAD (underfloor air 
distribution) in Parinee office at Bandra Kurla 
Complex, Mumbai instead of  conventional 
OHAD 
(overhead 
air 
distribution). 
Fundamental difference in OHAD & UFAD 
is the supply air travel distance to reach 
and touch the occupants. Due to this, 
distance travel by supply air is 3 to 5 
times more in OHAD as compared UFAD. 
Accordingly final temperature requirement 
is also different 18 to 20 C in UFAD and 12 
to 15 C in OHAD.  Hence Air Handling Unit 
(AHU) loading & ton of refrigeration (TR) 
consumption is always higher for OHAD as 
compared to UFAD. A properly designed 
UFAD system at MGL is resulting into at 
least 20 to 25% energy consumption as 
compared to OHAD.
2
Asset integrity 
and critical 
incident 
management
Risk
Pipeline 
& 
compressor 
infrastructure is backbone 
of 
CGD 
industry. 
Gas 
being inflammable and 
a necessity of life; asset 
safety, human life and 
continuity of supply can 
be at risk without efficient 
systems in place.
MGL has a Board-approved Asset Integrity 
Policy & Integrity Management Plan.
Additionally, the Company has implemented 
various 
policies 
and 
procedures 
which 
includes risk audit framework, operation and 
maintenance guidelines covering gas pipeline 
surveillance, defect assessment & repair policy, 
Management of Change (MOC) procedure, 
Non-Routine Operation (NRO) procedure to 
optimize asset integrity, safety & productivity.
Regular mock drills are conducted to check 
effectiveness and for monitoring and control 
as part of Emergency Response & Disaster 
Management Plan (ERDMP).
Negative implication would 
depend 
upon 
extent 
of 
damage 
and 
/or 
period 
for which gas supply is 
discontinued.

3
GHG 
emissions
Opportunity
The 
combustion 
of 
natural gas emits fewer 
greenhouse gases (GHGs) 
compared to coal and 
liquid 
fuels, 
and 
also 
releases 
significantly 
fewer pollutants per unit 
of energy delivered. The 
increasing 
emissions 
of CO2 and other air 
pollutants are primarily 
attributed 
to 
the 
rapidly expanding road 
transportation sector in 
India. The transition from 
liquid fuels to natural gas 
is proving beneficial for 
India, 
addressing 
both 
global warming concerns 
and 
health 
hazards 
associated with pollution.
Continuous expansion of operations gives the 
Company an opportunity to increase gas sales 
and thereby reduce GHG emissions which 
could be caused by other energy alternatives 
such as petroleum products.
The Company has undertaken systematic study 
for GHG inventory & Net Zero targets setting.
The Company is also, replacing, re-sizing gas 
meters, conducting regular maintenance of 
risers in domestic customer category, carrying 
out leak survey using FLIR (Forward Looking 
Infrared) camera at all CNG stations, CGSs 
and DRSs etc. are other actions carried out to 
minimize the methane leakage /emissions. 
MGL is in process to appoint Fluid Control 
Research Institute (FCRI – established by 
GOI and comes under Ministry of Heavy 
Industries) as Technical Consultant to verify 
and validate metering system in MGL and 
validate methodology of computation of lost 
and unaccounted gas. 
Positive implication because 
of increased geographical 
coverage & incremental sale 
of natural gas helps to reduce 
GHG 
emissions 
otherwise 
caused 
by 
petroleum 
products.
4
Human Rights
Risk
Non-adherence of human 
rights, a Company can 
be prone to operational 
delays, lawsuits, reduced 
employee satisfaction, lost 
opportunities in expansion 
or new investments, and 
reputational harm.
MGL has developed and implemented a formal 
Human Rights policy in place apart from code 
of conduct, which   is applicable to different 
stakeholders including employees.
Periodically the Company has taken positive 
affirmation from employees about understanding 
& adherence to the Human Rights Policy.
MGL supports the safeguarding and upholding 
of human rights. The Company conducts its 
activities in a way that respects human rights 
and is a business imperative. 
The Company prohibits any kind of employment 
of children or minors below the age of 18 at its 
workplace. 
Negative 
implications 
on 
case-to-case basis
5
Water 
Stewardship
Risk
Water 
is 
a 
scarce 
& 
precious natural resource. 
Wastage & sub-optimal 
usage of water can lead to 
acute shortage of potable 
water and rise in costs for 
business processes.
MGL has developed and implemented a 
formal Water Stewardship Policy in addition to 
general guidelines for saving water issued to 
all employees. 
The Company commissioned multiple Sewage 
Treatment Plant & Rainwater Harvesting projects 
at 2 of its city gas stations in FY 2023 -24
The Company has also installed, sensor-based 
taps to avoid wastage of water.  
Negative Implication. Over 
usage of fresh water can 
lead to increased business 
operation costs

Local 
communities 
including 
Corporate 
Social 
Investment
Opportunity
In 
developing 
nations 
like 
India, 
Companies 
have good role to play 
in 
ensuring 
inclusive 
growth. While CSR related 
Regulations 
make 
it 
mandatory, at MGL it is 
considered as one of the 
ways of uplifting needy, 
marginalized 
community 
through various projects.
MGL has a Corporate Social Responsibility 
policy in place. The Company considers 
local community as an important stakeholder. 
It continuously engages with communities 
through awareness camps to understand their 
expectations and explain the benefits of nature 
gas distribution.
Under the banner of ‘MGL We Care,’ the 
Company covers seven thematic areas. These 
are MGL Aarogya for health care, MGL Vikas 
for rural development, MGL Saksham for 
empowerment, MGL Vidya for Education, MGL 
Hariyali for environment protection, MGL Hunar 
for skill development and MGL Saathi for other 
social development initiatives.
Positive 
reputation 
with 
community will translate into 
faster project executions.
7
Customer 
relationships 
and 
experience 
and 
satisfaction
Risk & 
Opportunity
Risk:
In future era of losing 
marketing 
exclusivity, 
unsatisfactory 
CRM 
can 
lead to loss of market share.
Opportunity:
On the other hand, due 
to a common product of 
natural gas without any 
differentiation, 
excellent 
CRM 
can 
help 
retain 
market share and aid in 
increase of sales volume.
MGL has a robust consumer grievance redressal 
mechanism in place. All the Company’s CRM 
processes & practices are ISO certified.
The Company has an omni channel customer 
interface consisting of a 108-call agents  - 
24x7 customer helpline, 12 walk-in centers. To 
provide additional support to customers, there 
are back offices, mobile application, and social 
media channels.
A 
customer 
satisfaction 
survey 
is 
also 
conducted annually by an independent agency 
to gauge the satisfaction index of domestic 
PNG customers.
Negative implication. There 
are financial costs involved 
in running CRM system, but 
customer satisfaction is a 
positive outcome of it.
8
Waste 
Management 
Risk:
Unless 
hazardous 
as 
well as other wastage is 
disposed of carefully or 
generation minimized, it 
will harm environment and 
would entail costs due to 
storage space occupied.
The Company’s products PNG and CNG do 
not result in waste generation. But some 
items which are part of the pipe network and 
electronic items used in the Company offices 
need due attention. The Company has a formal 
Waste Management Policy in place.
All types of waste generated are handed 
over to authorized agencies to dispose of. 
Also, the Company has established 2 Sewage 
treatment plants which are already in operation 
and additional sewage treatment plants are 
planned to be initiated in the coming years. 
This is in alignment with the Company’s Waste 
Management Policy. 
Negative 
Implication 
due 
to 
non-effective

Occupational 
health 
and safety 
including 
Employment 
practices.
Risk
Risk:
The employees are the 
greatest assets, and their 
safety and wellbeing are 
of paramount importance. 
Improper 
handling 
of 
health and lack of training 
with respect to safety risks 
can lead to disastrous 
impacts on both property 
and the stakeholders. 
MGL is an ISO 45001:2018 certified Company 
and has a Health and Safety Environment 
Policy in place which is available on the 
Company’s 
website. 
This 
confirms 
the 
Company’s commitment towards health and 
safety practices. 
The following are some of the initiatives taken 
by the Company to ensure complete Health 
and Safety in the Company’s operations:
 
 
Personal protective equipment is distributed 
to all eligible individuals and usage of the 
same is ensured. 
 
 
Every contract person working for MGL 
gets 
trained 
in 
the 
required 
safety 
and 
technical 
competency 
(STC) 
and Employees are suitably trained. 
 
 
Apart from the mandatory annual health 
surveillance for all employees, periodic 
executive health check-up is also carried out 
to keep track of the health of the employees. 
 
 
Health and term life insurances, financial 
aids are also part of the benefits provided 
to the employees. 
Positive implications due to 
various employee policies 
and safety practices in place
10
Business 
Ethics and 
Compliance
Risk
High 
business 
risk 
is 
associated in case of non-
compliance or unethical 
business practices, and 
it can lead to financial 
penalties 
as 
well 
as 
reputational damages.
The Company has established and put in place 
a code of business ethics policy to be followed 
by the Company as well as all the Company’s 
value chain partners.

no cases reported due to 
fraud, money laundering or 
executive misconduct during 
the year.
11
Diversity
Risk & 
opportunity
Not only gender diversity 
but other aspects of identity 
such as race, ethnicity, age, 
socio-economic status etc. 
need careful dealing in any 
organization to foster equal 
opportunity & inclusiveness 
to all concerned.
The Company is committed to providing equal 
opportunities in employment and thus create 
an inclusive work environment which gets 
reflected through its talent acquisition policy. 
In its continued efforts to boost the performances

End-use 
Safety
Risk
MGL 
takes 
adequate 
safety measures including 
pressure 
reduction 
at 
appropriate levels as a 
CGD Company but lack of 
awareness about product 
usage, hazards etc. at end 
of customers could pose 
significant risk of accidents.
MGL caters to a large number of domestic 
customers. While at CGS the Company may 
receive gas at pressure of around 49 bar, MGL 
follows a pressure reduction methodology such 
that at cooking stoves, the gas pressure is just 
21 millibar.  
The Company’s invoices, mailers, web site, 
newsprint advertisements, registration camps 
and other mediums of communication. facilitate 
awareness creation. A strong after sales service 
mechanism is also in place for any eventuality.
Negative 
implication. 
This 
can be due to consequential 
costs 
and 
reputational 
damages for the Company.
13
Data Security
Risk
A 
large 
amount 
of 
personal data is captured 
for operational reasons, 
particularly in household 
customer category which 
puts 
customers’ 
data 
privacy at significant risk. 
Ensuring data privacy of 
customers is necessary for 
the Company and is also 
covered under the data 
protection laws.
Data privacy is covered as a separate chapter 
under MGL’s Code of Conduct policy.
Also, the Company has a web enabled 
registration process for its potential customers. 
In case, customer prefers to provide data in 
hard form, post scanning, the collected data is 
stored in the ERP system where the Company 
follows a strict access control guideline with 
due care on segregation of duty.
Negative Implication. Leakage 
of personal data can lead 
to 
negative 
implications 
including penalties, fines, and 
reputational damages.
14
Risk
Management
Risk
Risk 
Management 
is 
important in any business 
for various stakeholders 
but assumes much higher 
significance 
in 
CGD 
industry due to risk of 
accidents, 
volatility 
in 
gas prices and need for 
uninterrupted gas supply.
MGL has enterprise risk management policy 
in place which details the Risk Management 
principles and framework along with the 
associated procedures for MGL’s business 
environment and act as guidance for critical 
decision-making process such as strategic, 
operational, financial, legal etc. The Policy 
framework includes objective of identification 
of elements of risks which includes operational 
risks as well as business risks and assessment 
of 
management’s 
actions 
to 
mitigate 
the exposures periodically. Further, Risk 
Management tool is in place to aggregate risk 
data for identification of the elements of risks.
Negative 
implication. 
This 
can be due to consequential 
costs 
and 
reputational 
damages for the Company.

7.	 Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets and 
achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
	
We at MGL aspire to play a pivotal role in addressing the twin challenges of meeting growing energy needs of the country and 
reducing the carbon intensity by providing innovative, low-carbon and sustainable energy solutions. MGL is already  an eminent 
name in the city gas distribution (CGD) sector in India , with a mission to create a greener and more sustainable future in its 
Geographical Areas (GA) of Greater Mumbai, Urban Thane & Raigad district. 
	
With a steadfast commitment to environmental stewardship, the company recognizes its crucial role in mitigating the impact of 
climate change. In pursuit of this goal, MGL has not only made significant strides towards promoting sustainable practices, with 
natural gas as the pivot  of its  efforts, but also kept sharp focus on the Environmental, Social & Governance factors. MGL continues 
to strengthen these pillars while implementing changes throughout its value chain to meet the most pressing challenges including

India is one of the fastest-growing economies worldwide and has pledged to achieve “Net Zero” by 2070. The share of Natural Gas in 
India’s total energy mix is around 6.3 % and GOI has set a target to raise the share of natural gas in the energy mix to 15% in 2030. To 
align with the same, MGL intends to expand its scale of operations to promote the use of natural gas as a “Clean & Green Fuel. The 
company’s flagship product, natural gas, is renowned for its superior eco-friendliness in comparison to other available alternatives. 
Its usage significantly reduces the carbon footprint, making it a much cleaner and efficient fuel option. MGL has been supplying 
PNG & CNG at rates lesser than that of other CGD players as well as competing fuels like LPG, Petrol & Diesel thereby reducing 
the barriers and creating better access to the customers (Households, Industries, Commercial establishment & Vehicle owners) and 
promoting affordability. In the current year, MGL has completed the 100% acquisition of another CGD entity M/s Unison Enviro Private 
Ltd (UEPL) thereby expanding its footprints in three additional GA’s viz Ratnagiri, Latur & Osmanabad in Maharashtra and Chitridurga 
& Davengere in Karnataka. This acquisition will enable MGL to leverage the synergies & competitive advantage in substantially 
enhancing the Natural Gas coverage in these three GA’s of UEPL.
	
To minimize the methane emissions & reduce the waste going to landfills, MGL is planning to set up a Compressed Biogas (CBG) 
plant in Mumbai, capable of processing up to 1000 Tons Per Day (TPD) of organic Municipal Solid Waste (MSW), mainly food waste 
from 28,000 restaurants & over 400 star hotels, Banquet halls, Malls as well as Airports, Vegetable markets in association with 
Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). MGL is proud to be a part of this innovative and impactful initiative, which is aligned 
with the Central government’s SATAT (Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation) scheme to promote CBG. This 
project will not only eliminate 1000 TPD waste from going to the huge mountain of Landfill & methane emissions from the dumped 
waste but will also produce bio gas as well as Organic Fertilizer.
	
In any CGD operations, methane leakage is possible. We, at MGL are very mindful of such emissions & are constantly devising 
ways & investing to decarbonize its natural gas supply chain with a focus on methane detection and reduction of emissions related 
to the gas it purchases as well as the downstream carbon emissions emanating from supply chain. Replacing or Re-sizing gas 
meters, regular maintenance of risers in buildings, Leak survey using FLIR (Forward Looking Infrared) camera at all CNG stations, 
CGSs and DRSs etc. are some of the actions carried out to eliminate/ minimize the methane emissions.
	
During the year, MGL installed   sewage treatment plant (STP) at City Gate Stations (CGS) at Savroli and Taloja. These STP’s 
collect, treat, and discharge wastewater, providing a service essential to environmental and public health thereby eliminating the 
possibility of sewage leaching into subsoil and contaminating ecosystems. Also during the year, MGL implemented Rain Water 
Harvesting system at CGS Savroli and Ambernath for collecting  and storage of rain water , rather than allowing it to run off and 
utilizing it for gardening  purpose as well as replenishment of ground water.  
	
MGL has initiated Green Building Certification for its CGS  at Savroli, Mahape, Ambernath , Taloja and  two  Administrative offices 
in Mumbai & expect to get the Green Building Certification of a CGS & Office building in FY 2024-25. 
	
The long haul trucking market of India is expected to quadruple from 4 million trucks in 2022 to around 17 million trucks by 2050 
as per Niti Aayog – Zero Emission Trucking Report.  This segment of automobile market is predominantly on diesel   offering a 
huge potential in reduction of PM & carbon Intensity. It is worthwhile to note that due to the characteristics of this auto segment, EV 
penetration is likely to be miniscule. To effectively tap this potential, MGL has taken three initiatives this year. We have worked with 
an OEM for making LNG fueled trucks. We also commissioned LNG dispensing at CGS Savroli , MGL’s first LNG station  which has 
been receiving very good response .Also  , MGL has formed a JV  with Baidyanath LNG Private Limited, Mahanagar LNG Private 
Limited (“MLPL” incorporated in December 2023) to set up LNG Stations initially  across Maharashtra  to spearhead the shift of 
the heavy trucking and the logistics sector to LNG as a fuel. In phase- I MLPL will be setting up LNG stations at six locations viz., 
Aurangabad, Bhiwandi, JNPT, Gadchandur, Amravati & Kolhapur. Simultaneously, MLPL is also working with various OEM’s , LNG 
retrofitters & Fleet owners to  expand the LNG ecosystem thereby “Greening” the Long haul trucking market .
	
The Government has established an ambitious target of achieving 30% market penetration for EVs by the year 2030. An early 
investment in EV will help MGL diversify its revenue &mitigate future risk on CNG business. MGL is investing H 96 Cr. in 3EV 
Industries Pvt. Ltd, an EV three-wheeler manufacturing company based out of Bangalore for an equity stake of around 31%. MGL 
has already disbursed H 50 Cr, a part of which would be used to augment the manufacturing capacity from the current 2400 units 
to 6000 units per annum in FY 2024-25.

area that cater free-of-cost services to rural and urban communities from lower socio-economic strata.

also has provisions for penalty which is executed 
considering monthly performance of the respective 
contractors. On similar lines dispenser operators 
are rewarded for their contribution towards accident 
prevention at Retail Outlets.

many of the HSE related monitoring and evaluation 
tools. Android based application has been developed 
to ensure site compliance through real time site 
photos. MGL Lifesaving Rules is a set of rules which 
are mandatory for work execution and checklists 
are developed based on MGL Lifesaving Rules.

Describe the mechanisms to receive and redress grievances of the community.
	
MGL implements its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives through multi pronged approach. This results in giving direct 
benefits to the marginalized community as well as a snowball effect to more beneficiaries. MGL’s CSR initiatives under the banner 
of “We Care” cover 14 out of the 17 United Nations Development Goals. The entire approach is process-driven, focusing on 
need assessment at the inception.  MGL has instituted a robust framework for the selection of projects. A mandatory part of 
the framework is a visit by MGL’s official to the proposed community/ site to gauge the community's needs, enthusiasm, and 
acceptance of the proposed intervention. Instances of grievances of the community are almost NIL in our case since our business 
operations , project activities do not cause any  air  pollution , water pollution ,  severe noise pollution, acquisition of private lands 
, damage of natural resources etc. Our pipeline network is laid generally on public roads with due permissions and with minimum 
disturbance to general public.
