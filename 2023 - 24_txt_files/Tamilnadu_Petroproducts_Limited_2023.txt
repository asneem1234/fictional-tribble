 1
Carbon 
Emission - Risk 
& Opportunity
Given 
 
the 
 
growing 
emphasis on sustainability 
and  the  transition towards 
cleaner 
energy 
sources, 
Petro products companies 
face 
potential 
challenges 
including stricter regulations, 
carbon pricing mechanism 
and a consumer shift to low 
carbon alternatives. If not 
addressed, 
these 
factors 
pose as a risk to company’s 
operations, 
market 
competitiveness and long-
term  viability.  As a result.
TPL 
needs 
to 
address 
Carbon emissions as  a  risk 
and  explore ways to reduce 
their carbon footprint, invest 
in renewable  energy sources 
and adapt to  the evolving 
energy 
landscape. 
While 
carbon emissions present 
challenges to  petroleum 
products 
companies, 
it 
can  also be  viewed as  an 
Opportunity for innovation 
and diversification.  As a 
step towards  low carbon 
emissions, 
TPL 
can 
reduce or  offset carbon 
emission  by switching  to 
renewable power,  more 
hydrogen fuel  and invest in 
renewable energy projects
a.	 Baselining 
the 
current 
carbon footprint, product 
wise and also baseline the 
total carbon emission-TPL 
cumulative, scope 1, 2 & 3 
basis.
b.	 Detailed   activity   break 
up 
and 
activity 
wise 
carbon emission.
c.	 Time bound action plan 
to reduce or eliminate 
carbon from the activity.
d.	 Cost estimate and 
economics of various 
projects.
e.	 Setting a realistic timeline 
and targets.
f.	 Analysing cost 
benefit that every 
project can give, post 
implementation.
g.	 Implementation of 
decarbonisation 
measures and monitoring.
Negative
High carbon emissions can  be 
detrimental to  the company’s 
growth. 
Increasingly 
strict 
environmental regulations and 
carbon pricing mechanisms, 
carbon taxes can lead to 
elevated operational 
costs for companies with high 
carbon emissions. These costs 
can erode profitability and hinder 
investment in growth initiatives. 
It can also result in reputational 
damage as consumers and 
investors 
are 
increasingly 
concerned   about sustainability 
and the Company’s action plan 
to reduce product carbon. As a 
responsible Corporate Citizen, 
we also have to support the 
Government of India’s target of 
carbon reduction by 2070.

2
Toxic 
Emissions - 
Risk
Addressing toxic  emissions 
in 
 
 
a 
petrochemical 
products company requires 
implementing 
rigorous 
environmental  regulations, 
emission control  mechanisms 
and   regular monitoring to 
minimize harmful impacts 
on the environment and 
public 
health. 
Possibility 
of leak from the system 
while handling,  loading and 
unloading  pose critical threat 
to the environment.
Various  steps   are   taken 
to  handle Toxic Emissions 
proactively and   effectively. 
Release of  toxic emissions 
to environment  is practically 
Nil, as any draining is only 
through closed piping to 
Recovery  drum, from where 
it is recycled to system. Any 
venting is also only through 
closed 
header 
for 
safe 
disposal through Flare. HC 
& Gas Detectors are installed 
in various areas of the plants, 
to alert any leaks and to take 
immediate corrective action. 
LDAR (Leak detection and 
Repair) surveys are done at 
periodic intervals to  detect 
fugitive emissions & to rectify. 
SOP is available  and PPEs 
are provided to the concerned 
employees and also relevant 
safety trainings are imparted 
to the employees.
Negative
Toxic 
emissions 
can 
significantly harm companies 
leading to financial losses, 
increased operational costs, 
legal 
issues, 
reputation 
damage, regulatory issues 
etc. Addressing these issues 
through sustainable practices 
and emissions reduction can 
help mitigate financial risks.
3
Hazardous 
Waste and 
Wastewater 
management 
- Risk
The 
 
hazardous 
waste 
generated should be stored 
safely inside the premises 
and disposed off prudently 
through approved disposal 
facilities to avoid/ reduce the 
impact on environment.
The risk of spillage or leakage 
should be understood and 
addressed 
effectively 
as 
part of risk assessment and 
mitigation plan.
The  waste water discharge 
from 
chemical 
industry 
operations poses a significant 
environmental risk due to 
potential 
contamination 
and 
harmful 
impacts 
on 
ecosystem, 
hence 
it’s 
important to prudently treat 
the waste water generated.
The 
hazardous 
waste 
generated 
through 
the 
process    are     maintained 
in a   secured area.  Valid 
documentation for authorising 
generation  and storage and 
disposal is maintained. Also, 
a contract with the disposal 
agency is in  practice. The 
Hazardous 
waste 
annual 
return is submitted as part of 
the regulatory requirement.
The Company has to plan 
ZLD 
by 
consuming 
the 
treated 
water 
within 
the 
same 
manufacturing 
unit, 
to 
avoid 
inconsistency 
even when the receiving 
unit is not in operation.
Negative
The absence of proper hazardous 
waste management within the 
company can result in severe 
financial consequences. These 
include  potential fines   and 
penalties for non-compliance with 
regulations, increased liability for 
any harm caused due to improper 
waste 
disposal, 
increased 
operational expenses associated 
with mitigation and clean- up 
efforts hence causing loss in 
customers and investors interest.
Recent regulatory updates permit 
even closure of unit in case of 
gross violations

Two  plants of  TPL,  LAB 
(Linear Alkyl  Benzene) and 
HCD  (Heavy Chemicals 
Division) are ZLD units. PO 
(Propylene 
Oxide) 
plant 
has consent for   Marine 
Discharge of   treated effluent. 
Wastewater generated during 
operations from  LAB  and 
HCD plants is repurposed 
effectively by being utilized 
in PO plant. As a step 
forward towards Zero  Liquid 
Discharge 
implementation 
across 
TPL, 
National 
Environmental  Engineering 
Research Institute (NEERI) 
has been engaged  to 
study the   feasibility  of 
implementation of ZLD in 
PO plant, thus enforcing our 
commitment to sustainable 
resource  management and 
minimizing 
environmental 
impact

Opportunities 
in Clean 
Technology – 
Opportunity
By 
adopting 
clean 
technology opportunities, 
petrochemical companies 
can 
contribute 
to 
environmental 
protection     and also 
position 
themselves 
as a sustainable  and 
responsible 
player. 
At 
TPL we are actively trying 
to 
reduce 
our 
carbon 
footprint 
by 
exploring 
more environment friendly 
resources like renewable 
energy 
and 
alternate 
energy viz., replacing fuel 
oil DG Sets with Gas based 
Engines 
for 
improving 
energy efficiencies and 
conservation of resources.

Positive
Embracing 
clean 
technology 
provides 
the 
company 
with 
opportunities 
for 
revenue 
growth, cost savings, regulatory 
compliance, 
reputation 
enhancement, access to funding, 
risk 
mitigation, 
resilience 
to 
market 
shifts 
and 
long-term 
sustainability. 
These 
benefits 
can contribute to the company’s 
success and competitiveness in 
a changing business landscape.

Labour 
Management 
- Risk
In today’s changing times 
workforce 
expectations 
are  constantly changing 
and 
Inability 
to 
meet 
with 
the 
workforce 
expectations may impact 
the Company’s retention 
rate 
and 
 
eventually 
affect 
the 
 
business 
continuity hence causing 
reputational risk as well 
as 
productivity 
issues. 
It is also vital to ensure 
safe working conditions 
for the workforce and 
compliance to all safety 
measure mandated by the 
regulators. 
Considering 
the manufacturing industry 
with the huge number of 
workforce it’s important to 
have a welfare monitoring 
and tracking system.
By 
periodic 
and 
continuous 
interactions 
with 
the 
workforce 
and 
ensuring 
speedy 
grievance redressal TPL 
is committed to fostering 
a 
positive 
association 
with 
their 
work 
force. 
Having 
committed 
and 
engaged workforce aids 
the company in increased 
production and innovation.
Negative
Poor 
labour 
management 
can 
lead 
to 
deceased 
productivity     due to  disputes 
and strikes, increased labour 
cost due to inefficiencies 
and huge turnover rates, 
legal expenses   related 
to 
employment 
disputes, 
damage 
to 
company’s 
reputation, resulting in various 
financial challenges for  the 
company.

Chemical 
Safety - Risk
As a chemical manufacturing 
company, chemical safety 
is of utmost priority for 
us. 
Risks 
of 
Leakage, 
explosion, 
hazardous 
dust, 
odour, 
mishandling 
of chemicals  and reactive 
nature of chemicals is an 
eventuality 
we 
face 
on 
a daily basis. Therefore, 
Hazard identification,    Risk 
assessment and mitigation 
plan is critical to the business.
The 
 
Company 
has 
several multi-level safety 
features incorporated  in 
plant design, to  minimize 
plant safety & integrity 
related incidents. Plant is 
operated through a well 
automated 
Distributed 
Digital 
Control 
System 
(DDCS) 
within 
the 
operating  envelope with 
sufficient  alarms to take 
corrective  action. In the 
case of deviation  well 
beyond 
the 
operating 
envelope, 
automated 
interlocks are available 
to trip the equipment. 
Over 
and 
above 
this, 
mechanical 
protection 
devices like Safety valves 
are available to safely 
relieve to Flare, well before 
the design parameters of 
the equipment. 
Negative
Ensuring robust chemical 
safety practices is not 
only a moral imperative 
but also a  crucial financial 
safeguard 
for 
 
the 
operations of a company. 
The absence of proper 
chemical safety measures 
can 
result 
in 
potential 
costs related to accidents, 
causing damage to men 
and 
materials, 
legal 
liabilities, regulatory fines, 
and damage to company 
reputation

utilization of treated water. Similarly, in the HCD plant, a portion of the effluent water is recycled 
internally, while the remaining treated effluent is utilized in the PO plant process. This approach 
guarantees the complete utilization of treated water, eliminating any discharge.
