Climate 
Change
Risk and
Opportunity
Extreme weather events due to 
climate change pose a physical risk of 
disruption to Tata Communications’ 
operations, as well as to the safety 
and well-being of our employees. 
Additionally, the transitional risks 
due to climate change can cause 
disruptions to our operations 
which can impact our growth and 
profitability. Climate change also 
presents opportunities to Tata 
Communications to become a more 
conscious and resource efficient 
organisation. Tata Communications 
implements several initiatives 
and projects to ensure resource 
optimisation which enables reduction 
of carbon emissions through cutting-
edge technologies and innovations.

Risk and

Sustainable management of resources 
is vital for continuing smooth 
operations at Tata Communications 
and to add value to our stakeholders 
and communities. Unless efficiently 
utilized, resources may result in a 
risk for the Company and disrupt 
its operations. This material issue 
also poses an opportunity for us to 
enhance our systems to efficiently 
utilize our resources and augment 
environmental conservation. We are 
working towards minimising the use of 
energy and other resources, including 
practising recycling and reusing of 
resources. Further, we also strive to 
enhance our ESG performance as per 
the expectations of our investors and 
stakeholders.

Employees are of prime importance

health and safety issue can cause harm 
to the employees. We aim to foster 
a safety culture and ensure safe and

Risk
With the increasing thrust on
stakeholder capitalism, stakeholders 
are concerned about how Tata 
Communications is integrating 
the ethos of human rights into its 
operations. As a responsible corporate, 
this poses a risk for our operations as 
it is vital to respect the rights of all 
stakeholders and ensure that there 
are no instances of human rights 
violations, in any form. Through its 
operations and value chain
partners, Tata Communications 
ensures that no instances of 
misconduct occur at workplaces and
that human rights principles are held

Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues.45
	
Tata Communications does not tolerate any malpractice, impropriety, non-compliance, or wrongdoing with respect to 
Human Rights and its salient elements. To that end, Tata Communications has adopted an exhaustive grievance redressal 
and remedial framework consisting of its Whistleblower Policy. The Whistleblower Policy provides and addresses concerns 
or complaints regarding any reportable matters defined in the policy, including but not limited to infringement of human 
rights, including privacy rights and freedom of expression, disclosure matters, anticorruption, or any other company 
matters involving fraud, employee misconduct, illegality or health and safety and environmental issues which cannot be 
resolved through normal management channels. The Whistleblower Policy intends to encourage and enable employees 
and any person other than employees to proactively raise concerns regarding any such instances without fear of reprisal, 
discrimination, or adverse employment consequences. This can be done through Tata Communications’ “Ethics Helpline”, 
managed by an independent third party which enables a whistleblower to report a potential wrongdoing through various 
channels such as phone, email, web portal, or post box.

for domestic utilities such as flushing, landscaping and cooling tower water. In other facilities, due to space constraints, 
the wastewater is sent to municipal drains after appropriate approvals. We are also planning to explore alternate recycling 
technology for such facilities.

leading to GHG reduction of 6,306 tonnes of CO2. [Link]
	
2.	
Making a switch to renewable energy: A significant portion of our global electricity requirement is derived from 
renewable energy sources. This is in line with our commitment to reducing carbon emissions and promoting 
sustainable practices. In future, we shall continue to focus on exploring new avenues inorder to increase the share of 
renewable energy in our energy mix. [Link]

are continuously striving towards reducing our carbon footprint at the operational level, and have significantly 
improved our GHG intensity to 40.20 (metric tonnes of CO2 per million US$ revenue), a 11% improvement from 
FY 2022. [Link]

Community carbon offset programmes: We remain steadfast in our commitment to mitigating the risks of climate
change and kindling a positive change within the communities in which we operate. We have undertaken an extensive 
baseline and community needs assessment to identify viable carbon offset projects. Through this approach, we
have identified projects that have been evaluated on financial and operational levels and are aimed at improving
cook stoves and plantations. Our unwavering focus on these initiatives underscores our role as a socially conscious

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by 
your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices 
adopted to manage such wastes.56
	
Being a service-oriented organisation, Tata Communications does not typically generate waste as a by-product of its 
processes. The waste generated can be divided into two categories: non-hazardous waste generated by domestic 
activities such as housekeeping and cafeteria operations, and hazardous waste generated by equipment which provide 
services to customers. Such equipment is purchased based on business requirements, and Tata Communications relies on 
its suppliers for delivery of such products and services. Tata Communications aims to reduce the environmental impact 
of waste by focusing on the efficient and sustainable disposal of all types of waste. Non-hazardous garbage is collected 
by municipalities and authorized third party agencies to ensure safe disposal. Hazardous waste is appropriately disposed 
off through authorized recyclers. Tata Communications ensures adequate storage with secondary containments during 
collection and handling of such hazardous waste and ensures proper training of the waste handlers. The scrap waste is 
recycled and disposed through external agencies while ensuring that all regulatory criteria of waste management rules of 
relevant regions or nations are complied with.

190 out of 192 projects were completed, resulting in 
energy savings of 7.7 million kWh (cumulative) and 
energy cost savings of H 7.4 crores.
We have consumed 180 million kWh of energy during 
FY 2023-24, procured from the national grid. Almost 48 
million units (~27%) out of 180 million units consumed 
were produced from solar and wind energy. This year, 
we have added 23.14 million units (MU) of Renewable 
Energy (RE) capacity globally. In India, new RE projects 
were added with varied RE models, such as green tariff 
scheme leading to addition of 9.52 MU, Group captive 
model led to 4.91 MU of RE addition and Capex based 
Solar roof top led to 0.21 MU of RE addition.
On the international front, we signed a contract to 
purchase renewable energy certificates for our Wall 
facility, totaling around 6.6 million units. In Seixal, 
Portugal, we have become 100% RE operated with 
Guarantee of Origin and On site solar plant leading to 
addition of 1.9 million units of RE.
