Does the entity have an anti-corruption or anti-bribery policy?
	
Yes
	
If yes, provide details in brief.
	
Yes, KNPL has a comprehensive Code of Conduct (CoC) that extends to its Group companies, outlining prohibited 
actions like deception, bribery, forgery, extortion, and corruption. The CoC is applicable to any misconduct involving 
employees in their dealings with any external entities. Fraud detection falls under the purview of both the Statutory Audit 
Committee and the Risk Management Committee.
	
Under the CoC Policy, specifically in the section on Misconduct and Embezzlement of Company Funds, the acceptance 
of illegal gratification is strictly prohibited. Any employee found guilty of accepting illegal gratification faces termination 
from employment. Thus, KNPL’s CoC effectively addresses anti-corruption/anti-bribery practices.
	
Furthermore, the Company has implemented a separate Code of Conduct for Directors and senior management of 
Kansai Nerolac Paints Limited. This Code mandates that the BoD and senior management adhere to the highest ethical 
standards, acting with integrity and honesty at all times.

Also, the following initiatives were taken to neutralise such risks: periodic trainings and awareness sessions to build 
a ‘Safety First’ mindset and a dedicated focus on chemical safety; safety training at KIOSK & safety laboratories 
across all locations; and infrastructure upgrades to achieve the highest level of fire safety. Additionally, KNPL has

link, if available).
	
All necessary information about KNPL’s products and services is available and accessible on its website, https://www.

product posts on its social media handles, such as Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, and LinkedIn, to engage with 
customers.
2. 	
Steps taken to inform and educate consumers about safe and responsible usage of products and/or services.
	
Product information, including descriptions, performance features, benefits, applications, usage precautions, and 
technical data, is accessible via the product data sheet and the MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheet). Customers can 
access these details either through the Company’s website or directly, and they are also provided on the product 
packaging. Furthermore, this comprehensive approach ensures that consumers are adequately informed about the safe 
and responsible usage of KNPL’s products and services.

Policy, Mitigation Plan and a Review Mechanism to address any unforeseen disruptions in the supply chain or service 
delivery to its customers. Additionally, KNPL maintains regular communication with its customers (OEMs and dealers, 
among others) to promptly notify them in case of disruptions to products or services.

Does the entity display product information on the product over and above what is mandated as per local laws?

major products/services of the entity, significant locations of operation of the entity or the entity as a whole? 
(Yes/No)

If yes, provide details in brief.
	
KNPL ensures that all its products display the required information as per legal regulations. In addition to mandated

environmental considerations related to the product, guidance on safe and responsible usage, and instructions for 
proper disposal.
	
KNPL regularly engages with customers to gather feedback on products and assess their satisfaction levels. This 
engagement encompasses various methods like brand tracking, customer meetings, satisfaction surveys, and product 
training sessions conducted at the customer’s end. Surveys are conducted specifically for major business lines to 
gather insights directly from customers. Utilising this feedback, KNPL initiates and monitors various measures aimed at 
enhancing overall customer satisfaction levels.
