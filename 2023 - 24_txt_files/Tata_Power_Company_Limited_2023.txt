Discoms’ consumer-centric operations like Meter Reading, Billing, and Collection (MBC) activities, enabling them to become 
self-employed.
 
 We’ve also established the Corporate Social Responsibility program, Adhikaar, to bridge the gap between individuals and 
government entitlements and schemes. This program connects beneficiaries with various government initiatives, addressing 
the needs of diverse population segments.
 
 The Tata Power Skill Development Institute (TPSDI) caters to the increased need for infrastructure to train community members, 
especially those who are vulnerable and marginalized. TPSDI equips youth and others with employable skills in the Power and 
allied sectors, providing modular training and certification across a wide range of skills.
 
 With training hubs strategically located across the country, TPSDI collaborates with Tata Power Delhi Distribution Limited and 
The Centre for Power Efficiency in Distribution (CENPEID), Delhi. Our courses, aligned with the National Skill Quality Framework 
(NSQF), vary from 2 to 12 weeks, emphasizing holistic development including technical, numerical, IT, communication, soft skills, 
safety, health, and environment (SHE) aspects.

 Do you have a focal point (Individual/ Committee) responsible for addressing human rights impacts or issues caused 
or contributed to by the business? (Yes/No) 
 
 Tata Power is committed to upholding Human Rights for all its stakeholders (Tata Power Human Rights Commitment Framework: 
https://www.tatapower.com/pdf/sustainability/human-rights-policy.pdf). Tata Power had undertaken a Human Rights Dipstick 
Assessment in FY24 through an external assessor and facilitated by a committee of Sustainability, HR and CSR as a precursor 
to SA8000 certification. The SA8000 certification encourages organizations to adopt socially acceptable practices on eight 
key areas (child labour, forced labour, health and safety, free association and collective bargaining, discrimination, disciplinary 
practices, working hours and compensation). SA8000 standard will allow us to measure social performance, sensitize our people 
and encourage meaningful engagement on human rights in our direct and indirect stakeholder ecosystems. This will in turn 
enhance our internal systems and external ESG rating. Mr. Himal Tewari - CHRO, Chief – Sustainability & CSR is the focal point of 
contact and Sustainability, HR and CSR teams work on various aspects of human rights impacts or issues caused or contributed 
to by the business along with Ethics team.
5. 
Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues.
 
 Tata Power is fully committed to upholding human rights standards across our entire value chain. Tata Power has been 
working with this ethos and we support the well-being, dignity, and human rights of all our stakeholders. Our commitment 
to human rights is upheld by our zero-tolerance policy which demonstrates our effort to ensure an environment in 
which the rights of every individual are respected and protected. We have implemented stringent measures to prevent 
child labour and bonded labour within our Company and our direct value chain. In addition, we have specific policies 
in place to address workplace harassment and prejudice. Our human rights policy aligns with the principles set by 
the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC). We have also developed 
a comprehensive human rights commitment framework based on the UN Guiding Principles Reporting Framework. 
The Human Rights Policy elaborates on the grievance mechanism. The policy is available at the Company’s website at: - https://
www. tatapower.com/pdf/sustainability/human-rights-policy.pdf 
 
 The Company has adopted TCoC which categorically states that ‘We do not employ children at our workplaces, We do not use 
forced labour in any form, We do not confiscate personal documents of our employees, or force them to make any payment to 
us or to anyone else in order to secure employment with us, or to work with us.’ 
 
 There are various channels available to raise concerns and for redressal of the same. Also, concerns can be raised through our 
Whistle Blower Policy. An independent third-party ethics helpline has also been provided for raising concerns. The details for 
raising grievances are as follows: Toll-free Number - 0008001004382/8277, Website: www.tip-offs.com, Email ID: tatapower@

8. 
Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases.
 
 The TCoC underscores that any form of retaliation against individuals reporting legitimate concerns will not be tolerated. Those 
who engage in targeting such individuals will be subject to disciplinary action. If a complainant suspects that they or someone 
they know has been subjected to retaliation for raising a concern or reporting a case, the Company strongly encourages them 
to contact the line manager, the company’s Ethics Counsellor, the Human Resources department, the CEO & MD, or the office of 
the group’s Chief Ethics Officer without delay. 
 
 The Company has zero tolerance for sexual harassment at the workplace and has adopted a comprehensive policy on preventing, 
prohibiting, and redressing sexual harassment of women in the workplace. We have established an Internal Committee (IC) in 
compliance with the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013. Members 
of the IC are responsible for conducting inquiries related to such complaints. Throughout the process, the IC will safeguard the 
identities of all parties involved, as well as the contents of complaints and inquiry proceedings. 
 
Please refer TCoC at https://www.tatapower.com/pdf/aboutus/Tata-Code-of-Conduct.pdf

 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by 
your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices 
adopted to manage such wastes.
 
 Tata Power has robust waste management practices and aims to be Zero Waste to Landfill by 2030. Tata Power 
believes in going beyond compliance and has taken numerous steps to improve waste management practices across 
its operations. All businesses are optimized to minimize waste generation through evaluation of various options of 
resources, technologies and processes. These processes are also continuously reviewed and improvement initiatives are 
suitably undertaken and monitored for effectiveness. There are policies in place to ensure effective waste management 
including:
 
https://www.tatapower.com/pdf/aboutus/ash-policy.pdf
 
https://www.tatapower.com/pdf/aboutus/e-waste-mgmt-policy.pdf
 
 The major waste for Tata Power is the Fly Ash generated from thermal power stations. This is redirected towards construction 
(Ready Mix Concrete as per Fly Ash Notification) and Quarry filling as per State Pollution Control Board’s No Objection Certificate. 
Tata Power’s endeavour is to utilize the bottom ash as well in line with Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. For 
the renewable operations, Tata Power conducted a study on end-of-life considerations for photovoltaic solar panels. The study 
portrays future projections with respect to PV panel waste quantum, disposal problems and how to address them through 
technology and advocacy.

engagements. We provide clear and transparent disclosures about any identified conflicts of interest in our assurance 
statement. We recognize that failure to address conflict of interest adequately could undermine the creditability of the 
assurance process and the reliability of the reported information. Therefore, we strictly adhere to SEBI guidelines and take
