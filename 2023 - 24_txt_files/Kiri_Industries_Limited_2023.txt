Water
Management
Risk
Increased water 
consumption and 
constrained water supply 
are among the most critical 
global risks.  Considering 
our dependency on 
water for the viability of 
our operations, we have 
identified it as a material risk 
for us.
The Company has implemented 
total Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) 
at its dyes intermediates facilities 
and implemented Zero Liquid 
Discharge for few products of 
dyes manufacturing facility 
in order to reduce fresh water 
consumption and to maximize 
recycle and reuse of water.
Further, we have optimized 
reuse, recycle of treated waste 
water in the plant operations 
to reduce overall fresh water 
consumption. We have also 
increased reaction concentration 
in process to reduce waste water 
generation.

Community
Development
Opportunity
Community development 
activities help the Company 
to create a positive impact 
on society by undertaking 
meaningful interventions to 
bring significant benefits to 
large sections of society.
The Company is dedicated 
to generate sustainable 
opportunities for 
underprivileged communities 
through initiatives such as 
enhancing education, promoting 
sustainable livelihoods, fostering 
a healthy society, and supporting 
rural infrastructure development. 
Positive
3.
Health and 
Safety
Risk
In chemical industry, failure 
to ensure Health & Safety 
can directly impact people 
and community and
disrupt the operations.
The Company recognizes and 
accords highest priority to 
safety and well-being of its 
employees and other relevant 
parties. The Company’s dyes 
manufacturing unit is ISO 
45001:2018 Occupational Health 
and Safety (OHS) Management 
System with 100% coverage as 
on 31st March, 2024. 
We have embraced the safety

which covers all manufacturing 
locations, offices, laboratories 
and supply chain partners. We 
ensure health, safety and well-
being of our employees, visitors, 
contractors, and stake holders.

Organizations are under 
increased pressure from 
shareholders, customers, 
and regulators to mitigate

exposures within their supply 
chain. Not having sustainable 
supply chain management 
practices, a Company may 
be exposed to more risks 
including labour disruptions, 
workforce health and safety 
incidents, human rights 
issues, and shortages of raw 
materials.
The Company has established an 
integrated and flexible network 
to meet business requirements 
and engage with suppliers to 
assess their performance in 
accordance to industry leading 
social and environmental 
certification standards. It always 
focus on adoption of new-

7.	
Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, 
targets and achievements –
Business responsibility has developed new trends in the sustainability landscape. These are driven by initiatives 
that translate the sustainability philosophy into actions that impact companies and their stakeholders. In this 
challenging era, the Company is committed to demonstrate its highest level of service towards Environment, Social 
and Governance. Each operation in our plant which we undertake, we make sure and keep a track to act responsibly 
towards the environment and the society.
We have made notable achievements in the realm of ESG initiatives, showcasing its commitment to sustainability 
and responsible practices. The Company has undertaken extensive plantation activities during Monsoon, 2023, 
resulting to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions which in turns contributes to environmental conservation & 
biodiversity. Additionally, the Company holds an ISO 14001:2015 Certification for Environment Management, for its 
dyes and dyes Intermediates division.
We believe that industrial development and environmental integrity are not mutually exclusive. Indeed, they should 
be two sides of a coin, each side being equally important components of the coin’s value. For which, the Company 
has developed policy of Duo-Eco-Growth i.e. economic growth encompassing ecological growth.    
We ensures that it is compliant with all the statutory and regulatory requirements and the appropriate reporting 
/ filings in this regard are done timely without any lapse. The Company follows a well-defined procurement 
policy for procurement of goods and services. The IT infrastructure security and management systems are well 
deployed including disaster recovery. The HR Policies of the Company ensure holistic employee well-being and 
benefits, career progression, adequate training, safety and encouragement for women employees and well defined 
grievance redressal mechanism, thus ensuring proper governance. Accordingly, the Company has taken appropriate 
measures to inculcate beneficial and fair business practices to the labour, human capital and to the community at 
large. It provides employees and workers with working conditions that are clean, healthy and safe.
Further, we have been actively engaging our resources in CSR volunteering activities by providing a platform to 
interact with local communities with a sense of purpose and satisfaction. Our CSR projects focus on Education, 
Health & Wellness, and Women Empowerment.

to reduce overall fresh water consumption.
	
Increased reaction concentration in process 
to reduce waste water generation.
	
Segregation of waste water streams according

We have optimized reuse, recycle 
of treated water which in turn 
saves natural resource water.

Energy efficiency 
improvement steps 
taken to reduce 
fuel and electricity 
consumption
	
Increased batch size.
	
Increased total solids in our products before

	
Some modifications done in ice plants such as 
increased cooling coil, harvesting & freezing 
time settling done.
	
Increased spray drying capacity through 
airflow and pressure increase, spray nozzle 
and swirl chamber size increase, changed 
pulse timing etc.
Reduction in fuel and electricity 
leads to reduction in greenhouse 
gas emissions.

intermediates unit has gained the acknowledgement and appreciation of GPCB representatives, other government 
agencies and environmental groups.
At dyes intermediate unit, by-products are being recovered, recycled and re-used in process and leftover quantity 
sold to end users. Dyes intermediate unit has developed unique water reduction, recovery, recycling and reusing 
system. The Company has opted reverse osmosis technology for effluent recycling system at its dyes unit.
The Company takes pro-active measures for pollution prevention. Periodical internal evaluations are conducted, 
backed by third-party i.e. an Environmental Auditor recognized by the GPCB. 
The Company is having ISO 14001:2015 Certification for Environment Management, for its dyes and dyes 
Intermediates division. 
For emission minimization, adequate stack heights have been provided to all the flue gas stacks and process vents. 
Efficient air pollution control systems are installed in respective units and all are operated and maintained regularly 
to ensure adherence to GPCB’s pollution control norms.  At dyes plant, the Company opted bag type dust collector 
system for all spray dryers to abate air pollution. 
Additional to air exhaust ventilators, the Company has provided scrubbing systems at dyes and dyes intermediates 
units to improve work place air quality.  At all units, preventive maintenance of all valves, fittings, pumps and other 
equipment is carried out regularly to ensure that there are no spillages/leakages leading to fugitive emission. 
Sulphuric Acid is manufactured through the Double Conversion Double Absorption (DCDA) system, ensuring that 
emissions remain below than the prescribed limit of GPCB.
At Company’s plants, various hazardous wastes are collected, stored and disposed off as per the updated Hazardous 
Wastes Management and Handling Rules 2016. The Company Working area of all units is impervious to protect the
