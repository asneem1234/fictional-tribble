department. At least three quotations are solicited, and the selected vendor must sign the code of conduct and 
complete the ESG questionnaire before the purchase order is issued. Violations require corrective action within

Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and 
social topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board. 
	
The Company engages in consultations and feedback sessions with stakeholder groups. Subsequently, business and 
functional heads analysed material topics related to the economy, environment, and social aspects. The company identifies 
material issues through stakeholder engagement exercises. These issues are then presented to the highest governing

topics is conducted in collaboration with stakeholders. Once these issues are identified, they are mapped to relevant risks. 
As part of the risk management plan, strategies and mitigation action plans are developed for the identified risks.
	
These material issues serve as a guiding framework for the non-financial disclosures through the Corporate Overview, 
Statutory Reports, and Financial Statements in the Annual Report 2023-24. The Sustainability Report adheres to relevant 
national and international guidelines and standards, disclosing the management approach, targets/goals, and non-financial 
performance in the reporting year for each identified material topic.

development of future action plans, such as policy development and implementation of initiatives. This approach ensures 
a proactive stance towards continuous improvement and sustainable growth.

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishment. Describe the strategy adopted 
by your Company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the 
practices adopted to manage such wastes. 
	
Sigachi is deeply committed to clean manufacturing practices and efficient waste management. The company meticulously

regulatory requirements across all factory locations.
	
In a bid to enhance environmental stewardship, Sigachi directs nearly 100% of its non-hazardous waste to authorized 
recyclers. This initiative supports recycling efforts and contributes to sustainable waste management practices.
	
Moreover, Sigachi is actively implementing strategies to minimize the use of hazardous and toxic chemicals in its products 
and manufacturing processes. Through continuous process optimization, the company aims to reduce the generation of 
solvents and hazardous waste. Sigachi’s practices include adopting safer alternatives, improving production efficiencies, 
and implementing stringent waste management protocols.
	
By converting waste into valuable biomass resources, Sigachi is not only mitigating environmental impact but also fostering 
a circular economy within its operations. This holistic approach underscores Sigachi’s commitment to sustainable practices 
and regulatory compliance, ensuring responsible stewardship of resources and environmental protection.

Variable Refrigerant 
Flow (VRF) Systems
At Sigachi, we have implemented VRF cooling 
systems to eliminate water use for cooling. VRF 
systems are advanced air conditioning systems 
that use refrigerant as the cooling and heating 
medium. They precisely control refrigerant flow to 
multiple indoor units based on demand in different 
zones, ensuring high efficiency and consistent, 
comfortable indoor environments. By adjusting 
refrigerant flow to meet exact requirements, VRF 
systems reduce energy consumption and increase 
efficiency.
