Promotion of Quality education- Skilling for students- MASKILL/MA 
IAM, Skilling projects: 
India, with its rapidly growing economy and a burgeoning youth 
population, stands at a critical juncture where skilling initiatives are 
imperative for sustainable development. The country’s demography, 
characterized by a significant proportion of the working-age population, 
can be a boon if harnessed correctly. However, a large segment of 
this workforce remains unskilled or under-skilled, posing a challenge 
to economic growth and competitiveness. Skilling initiatives are 
essential to bridge this gap, equipping individuals with the necessary 
competencies to meet the demands of various industries, including 
technology, manufacturing, and services. By investing in skill 
development, India can enhance employability, reduce poverty, and 
ensure that its youth contribute effectively to the nation’s economic 
progress. Recognizing the critical need for skill development, MAFIL 
has made significant investments in skilling within Valappad and the 
rural areas of Coimbatore and Palakkad through its Corporate Social 
Responsibility (CSR) initiatives. These investments include support for 
three major projects aimed at enhancing vocational skills and improving 
employment opportunities. One project, in collaboration with the Deen 
Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY), focuses 
on skill development for rural youth, providing market-led training to 
improve employability. The MAIAM project was dedicated to automotive 
skilling, addressing the growing demand for skilled professionals in the 
automotive sector. MASKILL focused on nursing, training individuals to 
meet the critical need for healthcare professionals.
