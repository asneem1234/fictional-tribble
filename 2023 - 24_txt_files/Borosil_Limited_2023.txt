the availability and 
cost of raw materials, 
impacting production, 
and potentially leading 
to product shortages.

for the company to

GHG management 
is a material issue for 
the Company due to 
the inherent carbon 
footprint associated 
with its manufacturing 
operations, particularly 
as it aims to expand 
production. Balancing 
growth with emissions 
reduction presents a 
significant challenge. 
Failure to address 
emissions could 
lead to reputational 
damage and impact the 
Company’s long-term 
sustainability goals.
As a manufacturing 
Company, we recognize 
that our operations 
inevitably interact with 
the environment. There 
is an intrinsic connection 
between our sustained 
success and the well-
being of the ecosystems 
within which we 
function. Any potential 
degradation of these 
ecosystems, coupled 
with the consequential 
loss of biodiversity, 
poses a significant threat 
to our brand image and 
the resilience of our 
operations.
Negative:
Inefficient emissions 
management may pose 
an adverse impact on 
financial performance. 
Furthermore, 
reputational damage 
stemming from 
a perceived lack 
of environmental 
responsibility could 
lead to decreased 
consumer confidence 
and loss of market share, 
ultimately affecting the 
Company’s top line and 
bottom line.
Negative:
This risk may negatively 
impact the Company’s 
profitability and overall 
financial performance 
due to financial penalties 
for non-compliance 
with regulations, 
reduced consumer trust 
impacting sales, and 
operational costs due 
to resource scarcity or 
remediation efforts. 
The Company plans to 
leverage innovation and 
collaboration to address 
its GHG emissions. We 
will implement energy-
efficient technologies, 
work with partners to 
promote sustainability 
across the value chain 
and explore diversified 
energy sources. Regular 
monitoring and reporting 
will ensure transparency 
and drive continuous 
improvement.
Company is dedicated 
to preserving the 
ecological balance

environment where it 
conducts its business. 
We have established 
a process of ongoing

Supply Chain 
Management
R
The effective 
management of 
Company’s supply chain 
is crucial to mitigate risks 
related to raw material

At Borosil Limited, we view ourselves as more than just a glassware manufacturing Company; we are committed to making glass 
an integral part of everyday life for our consumers. In our pursuit of customer centricity, we remain unwavering in our commitment 
to sustainability. The very essence of our manufacturing—glass—is a recyclable material crafted from abundant natural resources. 
We have consistently invested in energy-efficient technologies, sustainable packaging, and responsible sourcing.
We are also evolving our approach to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) targets, which are clearly reflected in our 
Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report. As this is an emerging field, we recognize the challenges in measuring our 
performance against these ambitious targets and in assessing our value chain partners.
To address these challenges, we are developing robust processes to map key performance indicators (KPIs). Recently, we 
introduced our Supplier Code of Conduct policy, aimed at educating and empowering our value chain partners to align with our 
sustainability initiatives and compliance standards.
Our commitment to sustainability is not just a responsibility—it’s a fundamental part of who we are as a Company.
All Corporate Policies including the Business Responsibility (BR) Policies of the Company are ingrained in day-to-day business 
operations of the Company and are implemented by Management at all levels. The responsibility for implementation of BR 
Policies of the Company is ultimately shouldered by Mr. P. K. Kheruka - Chairman of the Company.

Agencies.
One such initiative, Project SAFAL, was dedicated to provide 
skill training and career guidance to underprivileged youth. 
The participants received computer training, tools to enhance 
their communication skills, and career guidance to pursue 
suitable livelihood opportunities. Through the Women's 
Craft Centre (Handicraft & Tailoring Unit), underprivileged 
women were empowered to achieve economic independence. 
They were taught stitching techniques and given skill training 
in handicrafts, enabling them to become economically 
independent.

underprivileged families, battling critical illnesses and enduring 
prolonged stays in solitary hospital rooms, were counselled 
during moments of despair and medication fatigue to express 
their deepest desires and were provided with educational 
support through digital tools, which enabled them to pursue 
their studies despite the circumstances. Grant of Wish Gift 
served as a preventive healthcare measures, fostering hope

treatments with resolve and complete their prescribed 
medications.

Patients at the Government Hospital in Bharuch, Gujarat. 
The Indian Cancer Society through its Project Satark, 
organised community awareness sessions across Goa,

communities, who once regarded cancer as a taboo subject. 
Through this outreach program, they are now empowered 
with the knowledge to take preventive measures and seek 
timely care, marking a significant step towards safeguarding 
their health and well-being.
The Inspire Institute of Sport (IIS) is a high-performance 
training center dedicated to mentoring India’s most promising 
athletes, particularly those from vulnerable and marginalized 
communities who lack access to world-class infrastructure and 
training. This initiative focuses on nurturing talent by providing 
comprehensive support to athletes, ensuring they can reach 
their full potential.
As part of this program, IIS ensures the preparation of four 
nutritious daily meals for over 250 athletes in the cafeteria, 
with costs covered for all food and beverage consumables. 
The institute also secures the expertise of both on-campus 
and consultant nutritionists, alongside skilled kitchen 
professionals and chefs, to maintain high standards in meal 
preparation. Additionally, IIS upholds the cafeteria’s hygiene 
and cleanliness, covering the maintenance and upkeep of

5.  Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its coverage and 
implementation.
The Company is deeply committed to environmental sustainability 
and has instituted a comprehensive Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) 
policy to meticulously manage its wastewater effluent. Under this 
policy, the raw influent generated from our plant undergoes stringent 
treatment processes to ensure that no liquid waste is discharged into 
the environment without any treatment. Our advanced effluent 
treatment plant (ETP) which commences with chemical treatment 
to neutralize and eliminate contaminants, followed by biological 
treatment to further degrade organic matter. 
Additionally, complementing our ZLD system, we have an 80 KLD 
Sewage Treatment Plant based on Membrane Bioreactor (MBR) 
technology for wastewater from toilets and bathrooms, which is reused 
in garden irrigation and toilet flushing. This holistic approach not only 
reduces the burden on groundwater extraction but also promotes 
water recycling, aligning with achieving Sustainable Development 
Goal 6 (SDG6). Through these initiatives, the Company continues 
to lead by example in environmental responsibility and sustainability.
The effluent then undergoes tertiary treatment stages, including 
dual media filtration, & activated carbon filtration (ACF), ensuring 
the highest level of purification. Subsequently, the treated water 
undergoes additional polishing through ultrafiltration and reverse 
osmosis (RO) at three stages to meet stringent quality standards. 
Once treated, the water is seamlessly integrated back into our 
operations for various processes, including cooling towers, chiller 
units, and forming machine cooling, effectively closing the loop on 
water consumption. With a robust capacity of 120 kiloliters per day 
(KLD), our ZLD system exemplifies our unwavering commitment to 
environmental stewardship.

8. Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details.
The Company has implemented several initiatives to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions through solar power installations 
and energy efficiency measures. In March 2021, the Company 
installed a 1 MWp rooftop solar plant on a warehouse within 
it’s premises, which directly reduces the reliance on grid power. 
Additionally, an 8.6 MWp (6.5 MW AC) ground-mounted 
solar captive plant was set up at the Gajner, Bikaner solar 
park, beginning operations in December 2023. We are further 
expanding with a 7.2 MWp (5 MW AC) ground-mounted 
solar plant currently under installation and commissioning, 
expected to start generating power by September 2024 or 
earlier.
These initiatives are designed to significantly reduce our 
energy consumption, resulting in substantial energy savings 
and a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. 
Through these efforts, we are strengthening our commitment 
to environmental sustainability, reducing our carbon footprint, 
and working towards achieving our carbon neutrality goal by 
2040.
To advance our sustainability goals, we have also undertaken 
several energy efficiency initiatives. These include expanding 
LED lighting across our facilities, replacing outdated devices with 
more energy-efficient alternatives, and upgrading compressors 
to more modern and efficient models. In November 2023, we 
replaced an old mold oven with an energy-efficient model, 
resulting in daily power savings of 85 kWh and annual energy 
savings of 31,025 kWh. We also optimized process parameters 
of various equipments, achieving daily energy savings of 3,000 
kWh, which translates to annual savings of 9,15,000 kWh. 
Furthermore, we utilized waste heat from online tempering for 
water heating in the Opal Glass Furnace-2 decoration process, 
leading to annual energy savings of 11,520 kWh.
