harassment, victimisation or any other unfair employment practice being adopted against Whistleblowers. With an 
aim to create awareness, during the year under review, the Company also undertook a series of communication and 
training programmes on the values, Code of Business Conduct and other ethical practices of the company for internal 
stakeholders, vendors and distributors, partners etc. A dedicated Ethics Helpline has been setup which is managed by an

of Conduct. The Ethics Helpline can be contacted to report any suspected or confirmed incident of fraud/misconduct on:
