Company is in the design and manufacture of Process Equipment and Systems and turnkey projects. This business, especially, 
manufacturing, has an impact on the environment in terms of energy consumption. Given the strong growth aspiration of the 
Company, the biggest challenge is to balance the growth while minimizing its impact on the environment.

fossil fuel space and move to green energy. The Company’s aim, as it grows, is to make use of renewable energy across its operations.
The Manufacturing and turnkey projects business is very labour intensive, and the availability of skilled labour has become a 
challenge. This challenge could increase over time as India increases its thrust on infrastructure development. Recognizing this, 
the Company plans to strengthen its inhouse training program to upgrade the skill of the workers which will be a mutually beneficial. 
In addition, the Company plans to introduce latest technology to increase efficiency in manufacturing and at the same time reduce 
power consumption. These initiatives are intended to reduce manual component of work, increase worker productivity, reduce 
wastages and thereby, improve the cost competitiveness of the business and at the same time to conserve energy.
The Company’s CSR program is focused on improving the quality of life of the communities by providing them with a good nutritious 
diet. We are Proud that Our Organization with the help of Akshaya Chaitanya an NGO in Mumbai with an attempt to make food
