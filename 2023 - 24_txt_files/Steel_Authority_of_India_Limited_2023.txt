Environment
1
Conserving 
water 
by 
recycling and reusing
R
Production processes at SAIL involve 
consumption of water from different 
sources and to ensure that there is 
proper usage and no non-compliance 
with 
respect 
to 
regulatory 
requirements, we identify this as an 
important material issue.
Across all SAIL Plants, substantial 
investments 
are 
being 
made 
to 
achieve the long-term goal of “Zero 
Liquid Discharge” through adequate 
treatment and recycling of effluent 
being discharged through the outfalls 
at the Plant boundary
Negative
2
Greenhouse gas emissions 
& carbon footprint
R
Transition to low carbon steelmaking 
is an important factor for the long-
term success of the Company. Hence 
this is identified as an important 
material issue.
SAIL is taking concrete steps to 
substantially reduce CO2 emission 
and increase the share of renewable/
nonconventional energy by 2030 as 
well as to achieve net zero emission by 
2070.

implications) 
Social
3
Human rights in operations 
and supply chain
R
As a steel manufacturing company 
with plants operational in multiple 
locations, SAIL has a vast pool of 
human resources to cater to. As a 
result of this, it becomes important 
to address all human rights related 
concerns across all locations in 
compliance with norms under ILO. 
Any form of non-compliance can 
lead to reputational damage for the 
company and hence is an important 
material issue.
-
Negative
4
Fair and equal wages
O
Employees at SAIL are treated equally 
irrespective of caste, creed, colour 
or gender. Fair and equal treatment 
is critical for all our employees at 
SAIL and hence it is identified as an 
important material issue. 
-

5
Employee’s 
health 
and 
safety during catastrophic 
situations 
viz. 
Natural 
calamities, 
medical 
emergencies 
(COVID-19)
etc.
R
SAIL 
plants 
are 
operational 
in 
multiple 
locations. 
Investing 
in 
employee’s health and well being is 
crucial for operational efficiency of 
the plant. Increase in safety incidents 
can create a negative impact hence it 
has been identified as an important 
material issue.
SAIL has implemented Occupational 
Health and Safety management system 
i.e ISO 45001:2018 certification. The 
Company makes constant efforts to 
avert all illnesses and accidents related 
to the workplace. 
Internal and surveillance audits and 
evaluations are conducted on a regular 
basis, which leads to continuous 
improvement 
in 
safety 
systems, 
standards, and performance. All of 
the above is monitored by the Board 
Sub-Committee on Health, Safety & 
Environment on a quarterly basis. More 
details are given later in the report. 
Negative
Governance
6
Ethics / Code of Conduct
R
Ensuring that all business operations 
function in an ethical manner is 
crucial for the development of the 
company. Any unethical behavior 
can create a negative impact on 
profitability of the business.
SAIL has a policy on Code of Conduct 
for all its Directors, KMP’s, Employees 
and Workers. It serves as a guiding path 
for an ethical and transparent conduct 
in managing the operations of the 
company.
Negative
7
Data Privacy and Cyber 
Security
R
Cybersecurity is a critical factor in 
ensuring trust and protecting data. 
Presence of an Information Security 
Policy 
by 
which 
the 
company 
is 
governed 
on 
data 
privacy, 
information protection and cyber 
security is important for business 
from a governance point of view.
SAIL has a policy on Information 
Technology Security by which the 
company 
ensures 
data 
privacy, 
information 
protection 
and 
cyber 
security. It has helped SAIL prevent any 
sort of data breaches and strengthens

Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy workplace.
	
	
SAIL has adopted “Safety Policy” which ensures safety of its employees and the people associated with it, including 
those living in the neighbourhood of Plants/Units/Mines. A dedicated Board Sub-Committee on Health, Safety & 
Environment (BSC on HSE) is in place to review the policy, procedures and systems on Health, Safety and Environment 
matters. At the corporate level, SAIL Safety Organisation (SSO) centrally monitors and guides the plants & units in safety 
efforts. Performance on safety parameters is reviewed at the highest level at each Plant/Unit every Monday. In line 
with this commitment, systematic approach to safety is adopted and workplace hazards have been identified, risks 
assessed and accordingly, control measures are taken on continuous basis to bring the risk to an acceptable level. Good 
Safety Practices (G-SaPs) are identified from the steel industry and are implemented at different levels. Various kinds of 
initiatives & drives/campaigns are undertaken on regular basis in all the Plants, Units & Mines to ensure safe working and 
bring continual improvement in the safety performance. Some of the initiatives are as follows:
	
a. 	
OHS Policy

Stakeholders are an integral part of the company’s growth strategy. Engagement with stakeholders is crucial to 
identify risks and develop a management plan for integration into the company’s business model. At SAIL, a rigorous 
Stakeholder Engagement approach is being followed, which entails identifying and capturing stakeholders;

1.	 	
Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and 
social topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.
	
	
SAIL believes that effective stakeholder engagement is essential for inclusive growth. The company aims to strengthen its 
relationships with key stakeholders, such as government, shareholders, employees, customers, suppliers, communities, 
NGOs, academics, consultants, competitors, and financial institutions.
	
	
SAIL engages with stakeholders through a variety of channels, from daily interaction with employees to annual general 
meetings (AGMs). The company also has dedicated board subcommittees to deal with economic, environmental, and 
social topics. These subcommittees meet regularly to discuss and address identified issues. Recommendations from 
the subcommittee meetings are presented to the board for approval, and an effective follow-up mechanism keeps the 
board apprised of the actions taken.
	
	
An effective engagement mechanism is incorporated in the Stakeholder Engagement Matrix. This matrix anchors 
stakeholder engagement on the following principles:
19
	
	
Completeness: Understanding key concerns of stakeholders and their expectations, and transparent and balanced 
reporting.
	
	
Materiality: Prioritized consideration of the economic, environmental, and social impacts identified to be important to 
the stakeholders as well as the organization.
	
	
Responsiveness: Responding coherently and transparently to such issues and concerns.
	
	
In addition to these principles, SAIL uses numerous modes to engage with its both internal and external stakeholders in 
a constructive manner and consciously captures their expectations. Frequent interaction with stakeholders, especially 
suppliers, allows the company to recognize focus areas and strengthen relationships with them. The company has 
adopted Customer Satisfaction Index and Employee Satisfaction as a few of the metrics and methodologies to gauge 
and quantify the stakeholders’ feedback. The outcomes of the feedback received are integrated into the organization’s 
medium- and long-term strategy and planning. The company strives to meet the identified goals for the shared growth 
of the company and society.
	
	
Customer feedback also goes into forming the basis for product improvement, product, and services development 
necessary for customer retention, market penetration, and growth.
2.	 	
Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, and 
social topics (Yes/No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these 
topics were incorporated into policies and activities of the entity.
	
	
Yes, stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, and social topics. 
	
	
At SAIL we have conducted Stakeholder Engagement and Materiality Assessment for employees. Stakeholder 
engagement is an essential element for the sustainability strategy that helps the company to learn from its stakeholders 
to identify and manage risks, to build trust and strong relationships and to identify ways to improve its performance. We 
try to understand where business interests overlap with the sustainability priorities of a company’s stakeholders. Basis 
the surveys we have highlighted materiality topics and are taking into consideration. 
	
	
We are also in the process of incorporating these into our policies and activities. This includes developing new policies 
and procedures, training employees, and reporting on our progress.
3.	 	
Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/ 
marginalized stakeholder groups. 
	
	
SAIL Plants have continuously been making efforts for development of MSE vendors by organising Vendor Development 
Programs (VDPs). Further, Special Vendor Development Programs targeted towards developing a supportive ecosystem 
to SC/ST entrepreneurs were conducted in collaboration with National SC ST Hub Office (NSSHO) along with participation 
from Dalit Indian Chamber of Commerce & Industries and TICCI (Tribal Indian Chamber of Commerce & Industries where 
procurement procedure and vendor registration procedures were explained to intended beneficiaries. 
	
	
During these meets, the vendors are also informed about the requirements of SAIL, items reserved for SC ST/Women 
vendors, registration procedures, benefits available to SC/ST and Women MSEs etc. SAIL has also been actively 
participating in conclaves organized by NSSHO for SC ST entrepreneurs. 
	
	
Officials of Invoice Mart are also invited to some SVDPs to inform the participants regarding benefits of bill discounting 
through TReDS. SAIL has in FY 2023-24 organized 20 VDPs and 18 SVDPS. SAIL Plants also provide support to local MSEs 
by mentoring, training, handholding and by providing technical support. SAIL is also incentivizing the local MSMEs 
(located in the same district as our 5 ISPs) by making steel available to them at affordable & competitive prices with 
suitable commercial terms to accelerate industrial growth of the region.

RPL is Recognition of Prior Learning. It was noticed that contract workers suffer most injuries due to their inadequate training. 
To build competence and skill development of contract workers before they enter the plant RPL came into shape. It’s a training 
and skill development center outside the plant premises run jointly by skill development mission and concerned plant where 
workers were trained on different skills. Contractors are supposed to take RPL certified workers, which is run by plant HRD 
department. It is a step to strengthen Contractor Safety Management (CSM) system in SAIL. 
All employees and workers are provided training on various aspects of human rights, as well as other key areas such as 
prevention of sexual harassment, vigil mechanism, code of conduct, and code of business ethics. This is to keep them apprised 
of changing regulations and to help them make ethical decisions and understand the consequences of any wrongdoing. SAIL 
strives to keep its employees and workers updated by regularly providing such training.

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases.
	
	
To prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in cases of discrimination and harassment, SAIL has implemented 
several robust mechanisms. We ensure confidentiality of the complainant’s identity and case details to protect their 
privacy and prevent retaliation. We provide support services, including counseling and legal advice, to help complainants 
cope with the situation. All complaints are investigated fairly, thoroughly, and promptly. Regular training sessions and 
awareness programs are conducted to foster a respectful workplace culture and educate employees about their rights 
and responsibilities. Whistleblower protection mechanisms are in place to ensure safe reporting without fear of reprisal. 
Through these measures, SAIL strives to maintain a safe, respectful, and supportive work environment for all employees. 
	
	
The mechanism is well laid in the Policy. For more details, refer to the Policy link (https://sail.co.in/sites/default/files/

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted 
by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the 
practices adopted to manage such wastes.
	
	
SAIL is committed in its Corporate Environment Policy to minimize source-wise solid waste generation and maximize 
its utilization to the tune of 100%. SAIL has adopted the “4Rs Policy” (Reduce, Recover, Recycle, and Reuse) across all its 
processes to foster circularity as well as the sustainability of the industry. 
	
	
Iron slag and steel slag are the two major contributors to solid waste generation. 100% utilization of iron slag is being 
achieved through its granulation and utilization in the cement industries. On the other hand, steel slag is used mainly 
internally through recycling it in blast furnaces & steel melting shops as a partial replacement of limestone and in sinter 
making as base-mix. Solid wastes like mill scale and lime/Dolo fines are recycled entirely through the sinter-making 
process. Waste refractory bricks are fully utilized by either selling to external agencies or reusing internally. 
	
	
Various R&D-based studies have been/are being taken up by SAIL either through its in-house research wing or in 
association with other eminent research centers or academic institutions of national repute to explore potential avenues 
for enhancing steel slag utilization.
	
	
The wastes, which are hazardous by reasons of their physical and/or chemical characteristics, are safely disposed of as 
per the rules of the “Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management and Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2016”, either in 
captive Secured Landfill Facility (SLF) or through the authorized recyclers dealing with Treatment, Storage, and Disposal 
of hazardous wastes. Some hazardous wastes are reused/co-processed. 
	
	
E-waste is being recycled/disposed of through authorized e-waste recyclers. 
	
	
Battery wastes are recycled through registered vendors.
	
	
A negligible quantity of construction & demolition waste is generated sometimes at some of the plants, which is 
internally utilized. During the demolition/dismantling of specifically old structures/buildings, a significant quantity of 
waste is generated which is disposed of through external agencies.

Describe the mechanisms to receive and redress grievances of the community.  
	
	
SAIL has a diverse and multi-dimensional approach to get feedback from the communities via holding regular community 
meetings, periodic interaction with municipalities and Town administrative committees and active engagement with the 
local society so as to understand if they have any views, issues, complaints and grievances related to the interventions. 
	
	
Centralised Public Grievance Redress and Monitoring System (CPGRAMS) is an online platform available to the citizens 
24x7 to lodge their grievances to the public authorities on any subject related to service delivery. CPGRAMS is also 
accessible to the citizens through standalone mobile application downloadable through Google Play store and mobile 
application integrated with UMANG.
	
	
The status of the grievance filed in CPGRAMS can be tracked with the unique registration ID provided at the time of 
registration of the complainant. CPGRAMS also provides appeal facility to the citizens if they are not satisfied with the 
resolution by the Grievance Officer. After closure of grievance if the complainant is not satisfied with the resolution, he/
she can provide feedback. If the rating is ‘Poor’ the option to file an appeal is enabled. The status of the Appeal can also 
be tracked by the petitioner with the grievance registration number.
