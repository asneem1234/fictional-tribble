The disclosures under this report are made on a consolidated basis. Vedanta Group comprises 
of Vedanta Limited, its Subsidiaries, Associates and Joint Ventures, the details of which are 
given in point No. 23 of Section A of Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) 
and on page 323 of the Integrated Report and Annual Accounts FY 2023-24. All these entities 
are considered for the purpose of Financial Consolidation of the Group; however, for the 
purpose of reporting data and information in BRSR, we have considered Vedanta Limited, its 
10 Subsidiaries and 38 sites based on the management’s assessment of materiality, the list 
of which are given as appendix to BRSR. The following categories of Entities/Sites have not 
been considered for the purpose of this report:
•	
Newly incorporated Entities or Entities/Sites operational for less than 12 months;
•	
Non-operational/ intermittent operational Entities/Sites; and entities/sites discontinued 
or outsourced.
Further, the GHG footprint, Water footprint, Energy footprint and details of the Waste 
Management with respect to the following have not been considered, based on our 
assessment of being immaterial to the Group’s reporting:
•	
The Corporate Offices with respect to the Entities as considered under the Reporting 
Boundary.
•	
Guesthouses and Colonies being owned and maintained by the Group.
Furthermore, for the purpose of BRSR reporting, following methodology has been used:
•	
The financial numbers used in some of the indicators of the BRSR are extracted from the 
Integrated Report and Annual Accounts FY 2023-24.
•	
While the financial numbers related to certain entities include inter-company consolidation 
adjustments as per the applicable financial reporting framework (net figures), the non-
financial data used in some of the indicators of the BRSR related to these entities are given 
without adjustments (gross figures). Further, some of the Entities/ Sites are considered for 
the purpose of said financial numbers, which may have been excluded from the Reporting 
Boundary.
•	
Some of the Entities are considered for the purpose of preparation of the BRSR on full 
consolidation method, without adjusting for minority interest in the relevant group entity, 
based on operational control, as per our assessment.
•	
In certain newly incorporated indicators, previous year figures have not been provided.

1
Climate Change  
and 
Decarbonisation
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk:
Vedanta’s operations are likely to be affected by rising regulatory 
changes and investor demands aimed at limiting or reducing 
GHG emissions. This will lead to higher costs for fossil fuels, 
penalties for emissions exceeding permitted limits and increased 
administrative costs for compliance monitoring and reporting. 
For instance, the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism will be 
applicable to our Aluminium as well as Iron and Steel business. 
The Company would need to potentially pay additional taxes for 
imports into countries implementing CBAM. Also, CBAM could 
increase the Company’s risk exposure due to decreased market 
access. 
Opportunity:
Vedanta recognises that transition towards a low carbon 
economy has resulted in increased demand for low/ zero carbon 
metals. Vedanta can leverage its expertise and resources to 
tap into these opportunities while at the same time reducing its 
carbon footprint.
Vedanta’s strategies for mitigating these risks include:
•	 Being a Net Zero carbon business by 2050. Our climate targets 
are aligned with SBTi’s 2-degree scenario.
•	 GHG emissions intensity of our metal businesses by 20% by 
FY 2024-25 from a FY 2020-21 baseline.
•	 Track long-term tier 1 suppliers’ GHG reduction strategies.
•	 Implement decarbonisation projects to offset emissions from 
growth pProjects.
•	 Launch/Develop low carbon products.
•	 Vedanta plans to dDevelop a Scope 3 emissions reduction 
roadmap in FY 2024-25.

Workplace Health 
and Safety
Risk 
Risk:
Neglecting the health and safety of Vedanta’s employees 
can have significant consequences for the Company. Injuries 
or illnesses due to unsafe working conditions can result in 
decreased productivity and efficiency, as affected employees are 
unable to perform their duties. 
Additionally, workforce morale can be severely impacted by a 
lack of focus on health and safety.
Failing to prioritise health and safety can also lead to increased 
litigation costs, as accidents or injuries may result in lawsuits 
seeking compensation for damages, medical expenses, and 
loss of income. Repeated safety violations or, in extreme cases, 
fatalities can trigger stringent consequence management for 
management teams.
Furthermore, regulatory bodies, industry watchdogs, and 
stakeholders may impose penalties, fines, or legal action against 
the Company.
The Company has taken some of the following measures to ensure 
a safe and healthy workplace:
•	 Implementation of Critical Risk Management (CRM) Program 
across Vedanta sites to identify the root causes of accidents and 
implementing systemic corrections.
•	 Improving safety infrastructure by deploying engineering 
solutions.
•	 Regular employee and tier 1 supplier training and senior 
leadership sessions to reinforce the importance of working safely 
and stopping work in case of any unsafe situation on the ground.
•	 External audit and certifications such as ISO 4500:2018.

Please indicate material responsible business conduct and sustainability issues pertaining to environmental and 
social matters that present a risk or an opportunity to your business, rationale for identifying the same, approach 
to adapt or mitigate the risk along-with its financial implications, as per the following format
Vedanta reviewed its material topics in FY 2023-24 as part of its annual process. In FY 2022-23, Vedanta Limited 
undertook a detailed evaluation to identify sustainability/ESG issues that are of material importance to execute its 
business strategy and growth plan. Furthermore, three of our businesses - namely Vedanta Aluminium, Cairn India 
and Hindustan Zinc Limited conducted independent assessments of ESG topics impacting their businesses.
The overall assessment approach played a crucial role in appraising the risks and opportunities that Vedanta and its 
businesses may face as well as in refining our ESG strategy. The comprehensive assessment attempted to follow the 
principles of double materiality, which involved assessing the impact of Vedanta’s operations on stakeholders (impact 
materiality), as well as, in some cases, evaluating the reciprocal impact of society and the environment on Vedanta 
(financial materiality).
The assessment procedure involved the following steps:
1.	
Identification of an initial list of material topics: By considering leading standards such as International Council 
for Metals and Mining (ICMM) and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), as well as analysing peer 
company priorities, a total of 26 material topics were identified.
2.	
Stakeholder consultations and impact assessment: The topics were prioritised after assessing the intensity 
of impact on a wide spectrum of stakeholders (both internal and external). This was done by consulting 1,933 
stakeholders using multiple engagement channels such as interviews, focus group discussions, surveys, and 
site visits.
3.	
Risk and opportunity assessment: An in-depth analysis of identified material topics was conducted to 
determine the potential impact of these topics on our ability to execute the 'Transforming for Good' strategy 
with a specific focus on topics that could have significant financial implications. Topics were then assessed 
against the risk threshold as defined in Vedanta's Enterprise Risk Management matrix. The assessment 
allowed us to evaluate the level of risk associated with each topic and inform the development of appropriate 
mitigation strategies.
4.	
Prioritising material topics: A scoring methodology was employed to evaluate the severity and likelihood of 
each issue using the inputs from stakeholders as well as risk assessment. Based on this analysis, the material issues 
were classified as high, medium, and low priority.
5.	
Preparation of the materiality matrix: Matrix was prepared by deploying two axes to evaluate the material 
issues, with the X-axis depicting the impact on Vedanta’s business, and the Y-axis depicting impact on 
stakeholders. The issue with highest significance for both stakeholders and business were identified as Top 
material topics. This classification allows for focussed attention and tailored strategies to address the identified 
material issues effectively.
6.	
Finalisation of the materiality matrix: In the validation phase, the results of the materiality assessment 
underwent a thorough review by Vedanta's senior management team and was signed off by the ESG ManCom 
chaired by the Executive Director. This critical step ensured the relevance, accuracy and completeness of the 
materiality matrix.

Water 
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk:
With many of Vedanta’s operations in both water-stressed areas and 
areas prone to flooding, change in water availability is a material risk for 
businesses such as BALCO, Hindustan Zinc Ltd., and Cairn Oil & Gas. 
Additionally, there could be water-related stakeholder conflicts. 
The impacts are as follows:
a) 	 Decrease in the capacity utilisation of operation resulting in 
productivity losses. 
b) 	 Legal conflicts resulting in loss of credibility and reputation of the 
Company. 
c)	 Higher financial burdens and increase in water costs.
•	 Water stewardship initiative to reduce freshwater withdrawal and 
maximise both reuse and recycle of water.
•	 A zero-discharge philosophy.
•	 Site-specific roadmaps to achieve water positivity.
•	 Technology deployment across our sites for process improvement 
and recycling of wastewater.
•	 Integrated Watershed Management Initiatives (IWMI) such as 
rainwater harvesting and groundwater recharging projects for 
communities to improve freshwater availability.

Engagement 
and 
development
Risk and 
opportunity
Risk:
Not involving community members in decision-making processes, 
can create conflicts with the community leading to delays in project 
implementations. The conflict may lead to stoppage of work at the site, 
leading to production and revenue loss.
Opportunity:
Maintaining a harmonious relationship with the communities in which 
the Company operates is crucial for obtaining and retaining the social 
licence to operate.
It helps create a positive outlook towards the expansion of the business, 
and facilitates the growth of the local economy by providing direct and 
indirect employment opportunities
•	 Social Performance Manager (SPM), at each site to drive the 
implementation of social performance principles.
•	 A robust grievance mechanism for effective resolution of social 
incidents. 
•	 Regular Community group meetings and village council meetings 
to understand expectations and manage perceptions.
•	 Community development programs at each site location to build 
confidence in the communities and ensure inclusive development.

Air Emissions 
& Management
Risk
Risk: 
Air quality management and emissions control pose significant 
challenges affecting environment and stakeholders, necessitating 
stringent oversight and consistent monitoring. 
Failure to comply could incur fines, penalties, and legal repercussions, 
disrupting regular operations. Hence, stringent air emissions 
management is imperative due to the significant operational and 
reputational risks involved.
•	 Real-time monitoring of suspended particulate matter, sulfur 
oxides (SOx), and nitrogen oxides (NOx) as integral components 
of our ambient air quality monitoring protocol. 
•	 Installation of Control Devices to reduce harmful effects of air 
emissions arising from processing of metals. 
•	 Dust suppression activities at our mining operations.

2.	
a. 	
Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)
	
	
Yes, Vedanta’s Supplier Sustainability Management Policy’ and ‘Suppliers’ Code of Conduct’ (SCOC) align with its 
sustainable sourcing commitment.
	
	
The Supplier Code of Conduct (SCOC) serves as the guiding principle for all of Vedanta’s engagements with suppliers 
and is a mandatory adherence for all suppliers and vendors. The SCOC is comprehensive; it addresses various areas, 
including anti-corruption, human rights, health, safety, environment, climate change, and sustainability. To uphold 
human rights laws and practices and ensure relevant legislations are being complied throughout Vedanta’s supply 
chain, the Supplier and Contractor Sustainability Management Policy has been established. Critical suppliers need 
to declare their commitment to compliance with the Modern Slavery Act. This approach further helps to prioritise 
Vedanta’s risk management measures for its suppliers. We also engage a third-party to conduct a risk assessment 
of their suppliers on various aspects, including regulatory compliance and compliance with the Modern Slavery 
Act (MSA). Training is provided for the Company’s buyers and/or internal stakeholders on their roles in the supplier 
ESG programme.
	
b.	
If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?
	
	
In FY 2023-24, 81% of the inputs were sourced sustainably from tier 1 suppliers.
3.	
Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling, and disposing at the end of life, 
for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.
	
Our Waste to Wealth philosophy pivots around our focus on minimising waste to landfill and integrating greater circularity 
into our production processes. Aligned with our ESG vision, we are working towards becoming a Zero Waste organisation, 
and several initiatives are underway to completely utilise mineral and non-mineral waste. As a part of Vedanta 
Sustainability Governance, we have developed ‘Technical Standard– Resource Use and Waste Management’, supporting 
our Environmental Policy, and applicable to entire operation lifecycle of all businesses. The standard has been developed in 
line with the Basel Convention, International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) and IFC Performance Standards with an 
objective to follow principles of waste hierarchy i.e., avoid, reduce, reuse, recycle, treat, and dispose across all operations. 
Vedanta is committed to design and operate in an efficient manner to minimise resource consumption and to identify and 
implement all feasible opportunities to reduce waste generation.
	
a) 	
Plastics (including packaging): Vedanta’s product portfolio includes metals and minerals, which are supplied 
to the customers without any packaging material. All the plastic waste acquired through suppliers is disposed 
through certified third parties. HZL, BALCO and, TSPL follow a strict ban on ‘No Single-Use Plastic.’ TSPL and Cairn 
have received Single-Use-Plastic-Free certification from the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII). As a part of 
the certification process, CII does verification, under the provisions of the Plastics-use Protocol: Verification and 
Certification (1.0).
	
b) 	
E-waste: Not Material to Vedanta’s operation. All the e-waste is disposed through certified third-party agencies as per 
E-waste management and handling rules.
	
c) 	
Hazardous waste: The Company has identified several hazardous wastes as per the Basel convention and the 
Hazardous and other Wastes (Management and Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2016, generated at different 
stages of operations. These include: used/spent oil, waste refractories, spent pot lining, residual sludge from 
smelters, etc. The hazardous wastes undergo several end-of-life treatment processes, such as internal reprocessing, 
co-processing at cement plants, processing by registered recyclers, and handling at registered Treatment, Storage, 
Disposal Facilities (TSDF).
	
d) 	
Other waste: Non-hazardous wastes include fly-ash (from captive and merchant power plants), red mud (aluminium 
refinery waste), jarofix (from zinc smelting), slag, lime grit (process residues from smelters and aluminium refineries) 
and phosphor gypsum (phosphoric acid plant). These non-hazardous wastes are termed High-Volume-Low-Toxicity 
(HVLT) wastes. HVLT wastes are stored in tailings dams/ash-dykes or other secure landfill structures before being 
sent to other industries as raw materials – thereby recycling the waste stream. Other non-hazardous wastes are sent 
for recycling, disposed, or incinerated.
	
For example:
	
•	
The use of Jarosite, a common ore processing waste, is being extended to multiple applications with the help of 
in-house technologies. In FY 2023-24, close to 35% of the jarosite generated was used for various purposes like 
constructing roads and creating enhanced use in cement industries.
	
•	
We have initiated an R&D project to explore the utilisation of red mud, a waste material produced during the 
processing of bauxite into alumina. This project aims to find innovative ways to repurpose and make productive use 
of red mud, further consolidating our circularity initiatives. In FY 2023-24 we were able to utilise 4.5% of red mud 
we produced.
	
•	
Composter used for biodegradable waste and converted manure is used for horticulture purpose.
	
Further, the standard defines procedures for on-site waste handling and storage, waste treatment and disposal, waste 
transfer and off-site treatment and disposal. Specific clauses have been described for safe handling of hazardous wastes 
such as display of MSDS and warning signs, authorised access only and providing emergency contact information and 
wash facility.
4.	
Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes/No). If yes, whether the 
waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to Pollution Control 
Boards? If not, provide steps taken to address the same.
	
EPR applies to certain Business Units within our organisation, such as HZL, BALCO, Cairn, VAL-Jharsuguda, MEL Nickel, 
and ESL Steel Limited. Each of these Business Units have a waste collection plan in place that aligns with EPR guidelines. 
For example, BALCO implemented a ban on single-use plastic within its plant premises and collaborates with a third-party 
recycler to collect plastic waste generated within the township. This recycler then channels the plastics to the cement 
industry, certifying BALCO as a 100% plastic recycling company. At HZL, EPR only applies to plastic received as packaging 
material for imported goods. These materials are unwrapped in stores and subsequently sent for further recycling, 
with a waste collection plan that complies with the Extended Producer Responsibility plan submitted to the Pollution 
Control Board.

Is there a mechanism available to receive and redress grievances for the following categories of employees and 
workers? If yes, give details of the mechanism in brief.
Yes/No (If yes, then give details of the mechanism in brief)
Permanent Workers
Yes. At Vedanta, we believe in open communication. We encourage employees to voice their concerns 
directly to their manager, HR, or even senior leadership. This transparency fosters a trusting and supportive 
work environment. All employees including workers and contractual staff, can voice their concerns 
anonymously by reporting to sgl.whistleblower@vedanta.co.in. Vedanta’s Technical Standard-Grievance 
Mechanisms outlines reporting mechanism for grievance for both internal and external stakeholders. All 
grievances received are registered, documented, and tracked within a secure database or an equivalent 
programme with controlled access. Each grievance is investigated, and a fair chance of representation is 
given to other individuals named in the case, if any.
Furthermore, Vedanta has streamlined its grievance registration process through the following initiatives:
•	
Unified HRMS System: The Darwin Box HRMS system incorporates a centralised employee helpdesk 
accessible to all employees. This portal serves as a one-stop shop for addressing employee queries and 
concerns.
•	
Dedicated HR SPoCs: For personalised assistance, Vedanta has designated HR Single Points of Contact 
(SPoCs) to address employee grievances effectively. HR of the respective businesses share grievances 
with the authorised person. The grievances are expected to be resolved within 20 days of being 
reported. If a grievance is not resolved within the stipulated time, the issue is escalated to the grievance 
committee, which then takes the action to close the grievance.
•	
Grievance/suggestion Boxes: Sites have suggestion boxes installed, where employees, and business 
partners can report a grievance or offer solutions to improve processes.
•	
Grievances can also be raised informally during meetings, engagement sessions.

10.	 Health and safety management system:
a.	
Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Yes/ No). If yes, 
the coverage of such a system?
	
Yes, Vedanta’s health and safety policy is aligned with International Council for Metals and Mining (ICMM) guidelines, 
International Finance Corporations (IFC) recommendations and applicable international standards. It is committed to 
achieving excellence in Health and Safety Management. Our goal is to eliminate unsafe work conditions. This applies 
across all our operations, encompassing subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates, and acquisitions. All our operations are 
certified with ISO 45001:2018. A robust government structure has been implemented and monitored via Vedanta Safety 
Performance Standard.
b.	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by 
the entity?
	
In line with the requirements of ISO 45001:2018, the Technical Standard-Safety Management (https://www.vedantalimited.
com/uploads/esg/esg-sustainability-framework/Safety-Management.pdf) sets out the requirement of following 
established methodologies such as Hazard Identification study (HAZID), Hazard and Operability study (HAZOP), or a 
quantitative risk assessment (QRA) along with Job Safety Analysis (JSA) to identify facility-specific occupational risks 
and hazards. Further, management plans are developed, and a structured approach is adopted to eliminate and control 
the identified hazards, such as safety interaction, VFL(Visible Felt Leadership) visits, contractors safety field audit(CSFA), 
further based on the data received from Enablon(Vunified Digital Platform for HSES process), sites are assessed and 
action plans are ensured.
	
Further, Vedanta has initiated a Critical Risk Management (CRM) program, a risk-based approach based on International 
Council for Metals and Mining’s (ICMM) 9-step methodology to identify and evaluate critical risks and to measure the 
effectiveness of control activities. Under CRM, we have identified 13 critical risks namely Vehicle Pedestrian Interaction, 
Fall of person and objects from Height, Uncontrolled Release of Energy, Uncontrolled Load During Lifting, Event in Confined 
Space, Contact with Electricity, Entanglement in Moving and Rotating Equipment, Events in Rail operations, Slope Failure-
Surface, Fall of Ground: Under Ground, Incidents during Blasting, Incidents in Shaft & hoisting and Loss of containment 
of Molten Material across our operations based on past incidents and fatalities records. We are in a continuous process 
of rolling out improvised control designs for the risks identified to minimise or eliminate each risk across the Group and 
create a zero-harm workplace for all.
c.	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such risks. 
(Y/N)
	
Yes, Vedanta’s digital platform called "V-Unified”, serves as a central system for reporting any work-related hazards 
by employees, workers, visitors, etc. This system allows for effective tracking and closure of every hazard reported in 
the system. Each site is assigned a healthiness score, which is meticulously tracked to enhance safety controls and 
infrastructure continuously. Following additional measures have been taken to ensure minimum safety incidents:
	•
All our employees are required to conduct safety interactions, scheduled hazard tours, critical risk verifications enabling 
employees to identify and report potential hazards. These processes are governed by our standards like MS11, GN42, 
GN43, which are part of the Vedanta Sustainability Framework (VSF).
	•
Vedanta businesses have deployed tech-based camera surveillance systems such as AI cameras (T-Pulse system), 
at most of its sites/plant locations. These systems assist in monitoring and reporting of unsafe acts/conditions in 
real time.
	
– Employees have the right to refusal of work if they feel unsafe to work. Safety teams conducts regular trainings 
onsite to promote the mindset and practice of exercising the right.
	•
Each site is assigned a healthiness score, meticulously tracked to enhance safety controls and infrastructure 
continuously. Across all our operations, we adhere to a 'Safety Pause' protocol, ensuring that work halts immediately if 
deemed unsafe, mitigating any potential incidents or accidents proactively.

12.	 Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy workplace.
	
Vedanta prioritises safety through a comprehensive health and safety framework. This framework governs all 
organisational activities and is implemented through established technical, management, and safety standards. 
Recognising the inherent risks associated with our operations, we are steadfastly committed to achieving a zero-
harm work environment. Safety and occupational health remain core values, guiding our continuous efforts 
towards improvement.
	
Leveraging insights gleaned from past incidents, we have proactively identified key challenges and developed a multi-
pronged action plan. This plan outlines several initiatives aimed at enhancing safety, some of which include:
	•
Critical Risk Management (CRM): Leveraging past incident data, Vedanta has proactively identified 13 critical risks. 
To mitigate these, a comprehensive Critical Risk Management Program has been established. This program details 
specific control measures for each identified risk and has been implemented across all Vedanta operations. The 
program empowers our line functions to continually monitor the effectiveness of these critical controls, ensuring a 
consistently safe work environment.
In FY2024 alone, the program facilitated the completion of approximately 46,000 verification activities and the 
generation of 2,500 action plans, demonstrating our unwavering commitment to continuous improvement in safety..
	•
Improving safety infrastructure: Complementing our Critical Risk Management Program, the Infra-matrix program 
identifies critical infrastructure requirements associated with each high-priority risk. This program ensures that all 
Vedanta sites implement these essential infrastructure elements. The program has contributed to significant safety 
enhancements, including building 30+km pedestrian pathway network, 80+ designated parking areas, 47km of conveyor 
guarding, and the procurement of 2,000 electrical PPE units and specialised tools. The Infra-matrix program fosters a 
culture of safety by garnering strong commitment from senior management, who play a vital role in ensuring sufficient 
focus is placed on infrastructure needs.
	•
Provision of PPEs: Vedanta prioritises the well-being of its workforce by ensuring all employees and workers have 
access to appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). This PPE is carefully selected to address the specific risks 
and requirements associated with each individual's role and work environment. Furthermore, Vedanta maintains a 
system of strict availability, guaranteeing that PPE is readily accessible to all personnel before they begin their tasks. 
This proactive approach fosters a culture of safety and empowers our employees to work confidently.
	•
Safety Governance System: A CEO-sponsored committee comprising of a Business Unit CEO, with business unit and 
safety experts representation governs critical risk management, infrastructure implementation, and injury prevention 
efforts. This ensures continuous improvement in site safety performance.
	•
Employee and Tier 1 Supplier Business Partner Training: Vedanta fosters a safety-first culture through comprehensive 
training programs, including on-site sessions, virtual webinars, and CEO-led discussions, empowering both employees 
and tier 1 suppliers business partners to prioritise safety and intervene in unsafe situations.

significant risks / concerns arising from assessments of health and safety practices and working conditions.
	
During the year, Vedanta experienced near-miss incidents, injuries, and fatalities at our operating sites. Workplace safety 
continues to be a significant concern for the management. We are committed to ongoing improvement in this area, 
and have conducted a comprehensive review of our safety strategies. The review helped us to identify opportunities to 
strengthen safety measures at all operational levels.
	
Any incident once reported is subject to a thorough investigation by the leadership team. Of all the incidents, High-
Potential Incidents (HiPos), and fatalities are investigated in the most comprehensive manner. Key learnings and insights 
gleaned from these investigations are disseminated across the organisation, fostering a culture of shared knowledge and 
understanding. This multi-level communication promotes the exchange of diverse perspectives and facilitates continous 
improvement of control designs. In FY 2023-24, unfortunately we had 3 fatalities due to road accidents and work at height. 
Few corrective actions are listed below:

Detection, Fall Protection Monitoring at Height. More than 300 cameras are configured for this purpose. By leveraging 
such advanced detection technology, Vedanta aims to create a proactive safety environment that fosters a culture of 
risk awareness and reduces the potential for incidents.
	
2. 	
Enablon implementation: Vedanta has implemented Enablon, a unified digital platform for comprehensive 
management of safety and sustainability data. This platform centralises the reporting, tracking, and analysis of 
various data points, such as incident data, observation data, and inspection data. Enablon empowers our businesses 
to make data-driven decisions for continuous improvement. It facilitates transparent reporting with clear timelines 
accessible by all organisational levels. The platform also streamlines the reporting process, enabling timely closure of 
reports and minimising manual data capture, thereby reducing the risk of human error and limitations.
	
3. 	
Critical Risk Management: Leveraging insights from past fatality data, Vedanta has proactively identified 13 critical 
risks. To mitigate these risks, a comprehensive Critical Risk Management Program has been established. This 
program details specific control measures for each identified risk. The Vedanta Critical Risk Management Program 
has been implemented across all operational sites, ensuring the consistent effectiveness of these critical controls in 
safeguarding personnel.
	
4. 	
Infra-matrix Program: Complementing our Critical Risk Management Program, the Infra-matrix program identifies 
critical infrastructure requirements associated with each high-priority risk. Details on this program have been 
provided in question 12 above.
	
5.

Leadership Indicators
1.	
Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and social 
topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.
	
Stakeholder consultation is an ongoing endeavour. We engage regularly across various platforms to ensure inclusive 
dialogue. Each Business Unit has its tailored engagement plan, overseen by Business Unit heads, who maintain consistent 
communication with relevant stakeholders.
	
Each Board committee seeks representation from relevant functional teams. These functional teams provide the Board 
with regular updates, including feedback and expectation from stakeholders. Eg: The HSE & Sustainability team provides 
updates to the ESG Committee on consultations and discussions from stakeholders such as investors, rating agencies, 
media, and employees. Similarly, the CSR team provides updates from local communities to the CSR Committee. The 
Company Secretary and Legal teams assists the Audit committee understand concerns raised by shareholders and 
regulators, Additionally, the Annual General Meeting provides the Board to interact with shareholders on a quarterly basis.
2. 	
Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, and social 
topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these topics 
were incorporated into policies and activities of the entity.
	
Yes.
	
Stakeholder consultation is a key element of the materiality assessment exercise, one of the major activities are 
stakeholder consultation. At the heart of the stakeholder engagement process lies the determining of issues that are 
material to our business from the environmental, social and governance perspectives. These issues also reflect the needs 
and concerns of our stakeholders. In FY 2022-23, a Group-wide materiality assessment exercise was carried out, along 
with similar exercises at three of our Business Units. The broad process followed is delineated below:
	•
Circulation of interview guides and questionnaires among the identified groups of stakeholders.
	•
Arrangement of stakeholder meetings by relevant departments within Vedanta.
	•
Capture of the feedback given and the suggestions made
	
We maintain a consistent and robust connection with stakeholders, both internal and external, regarding sustainable 
issues, recognising their impact on our business. Regular engagement helps us grasp their perspectives and adjust to 
market dynamics for proactive risk management.
	
To prioritise material issues, we analysed stakeholder responses and conducted a risk assessment according to ICMM 
requirements. Using a scoring methodology, we evaluated the severity and likelihood of each issue, categorising them 
as high, medium, or low priority. Our prioritisation considers both financial materiality, focussing on topics influencing 
enterprise value, and impact materiality, addressing issues affecting stakeholders, the economy, environment, and people.
	
Through this process, we gain qualitative and quantitative insights into Vedanta's environmental and social impact, 
aligning our nine aims with relevant KPIs, policies, and standards.
3.	
Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/ 
marginalised stakeholder groups.
Employees: We have established a welfare committee to help with employee engagement initiatives through employee 
training, and by organising other outreach activities.
LGBTQ Community: To reinforce our commitment towards creating a discrimination-free and inclusive workplace and to 
promote supportive behaviour within our organisation, we have launched ‘Samanvay’, a group-wide gender sensitisation 
and awareness drive.
For example, Vedanta has introduced a pioneering 'Gender Reaffirmation Leaves and Compensation Policy' for LGBTQ+ 
employees across all its locations. The policy supports transgender employees with a one-time grant of ` 2 lakhs 
rupees for gender reassignment surgery expense. It also provides a 30-day paid leave to ensure a supportive transition 
period focussed on self-care for those utilising the policy. Moreover, Hindustan Zinc has been recognised at the National 
Transgender Awards 2024 for its contribution towards for creating equal opportunities for the LGBTQ community.
Community: The Company has established a comprehensive social framework as a key to engaging with local 
communities. The Social Performance Steering Committee (SPSC) employs a cross-functional approach to community 
engagement through community group meetings and village council meetings.
We have established a dedicated on-site social performance management team and a robust grievance redressal 
framework to effectively manage our community relations. Our approach across all businesses involves localised 
community consultations and needs assessments. We actively engage in open dialogues with communities near our 
operations to understand their developmental and livelihood needs, tailoring interventions accordingly. This direct 
engagement acknowledges the unique needs and aspirations of each community, empowering them and promoting 
local capacity-building. Our system incorporates two-way communication mechanisms to systematically capture and 
document any questions, complaints, grievances, or incidents raised by communities. Business Unit wise site-level 
staff reports community incidents, which are discussed in larger employee meetings. This ensures that the needs and 
expectations of the community are met while fostering transparent and constructive communication.
In the last quarter of FY 2022-23, Vedanta had introduced ‘Project Panchhi’ an innovative corporate recruitment drive 
which aims to employ 1,000 girls from economically backward communities, across its diverse businesses in metals, 
mining, oil and gas situated pan-India. The target demography of this drive is girls from lower income families who are 
likely to opt out of pursuing further studies and a fulfilling career, owing to financial and social constraints. Project Panchhi 
strives towards inclusive development of the local communities, in line with Vedanta’s overall vision for diversity, equity 
and inclusion The objective of the programme is two-fold – To create opportunities for deserving young women from 
underserved, remote communities in the immediate vicinity of the company’s metals, mining and oil and gas businesses 
in Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Karnataka, and Goa and to increase the diversity in its workforce by 
specifically focussing on the recruitment of girls and women, who are underrepresented in the metals, mining and heavy 
engineering industries. In the first phase, 40 such girls have been identified for recruitment, at Vedanta Aluminium’s 
Lanjigarh operations. The selected candidates were handed over their offer letters in the felicitation ceremony arranged.

Do you have a focal point (Individual/ Committee) responsible for addressing human rights impacts or issues caused or 
contributed to by the business? (Yes/No)
Yes, Vedanta upholds core value of ‘Respect’, which is evident in our approach to human rights. Our Human Rights Policy 
underscores our unwavering commitment to fulfilling our social responsibilities as both a direct and indirect employer, 
while also ensuring the protection and respect of human rights for all stakeholders. The company also complies with the 
Modern Slavery Act (UK), 2015.
We work to enhance our social performance and address the impacts our activities have on communities through cross-
functional Social Performance Steering Committee (SPSC) established at all our sites. The committee employs a cross-
functional approach to community engagement through community group meetings and village council meetings.
Additionally, the SPSC is supported by the Company functions such as External Affairs/ Public Relations, Operations, 
Security, CSR, Human Resources (HR), HSE, Finance, and Corporate Communications and each one has specific 
responsibilities for preventing and addressing concerned human rights such as leaves, hours, wages, child or forced 
labor, health and safety, discrimination, freedom of association and others. Each of these departments has distinct duties 
in preventing and addressing human rights issues, maintaining human rights standards, and ensuring that suitable 
safeguards are in place to protect the rights and well-being of individuals impacted by the Company’s operations.
The SPSCs ensure an effective local stakeholder engagement and a grievance redressal mechanism in a timely manner 
addressing any human rights impacts associated with the Company’s business operations. The Social Performance 
Manager (SPM) is the convening authority for the SPSC, which is supported by a Community Liaison Officer (CLO), whose 
primary responsibility is to have regular interactions with the local communities.
5.	
Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues.
Vedanta’s Technical Standard and Guidance Note on the Grievance Mechanism, is a part of the Vedanta Sustainability 
Framework (VSF). This mechanism serves as a platform for both employees and external stakeholders to voice their 
concerns or grievances related to human rights issues. This mechanism is designed to accept and resolve complaints, 
disputes, or grievances presented by employees or external stakeholders. It offers a fair and prompt avenue to all 
community segments to express their concerns.
The Company’s Grievance Mechanism is communicated through community liaisons and ongoing engagement, which 
ensures that aspects of legitimacy, accessibility, predictability, equitability, rights-compatibility, transparency, dialogue, and 
engagement are met. It provides clear processes for complaint and grievance resolution and includes escalation pathways 
for unresolved issues.

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases.
Vedanta adheres to a strict policy of zero tolerance for any discrimination and harassment across its operations. The 
company has established an Anti-Harassment Policy and a Policy on the Prevention and Prohibition of Sexual Harassment 
at the Workplace (POSH). The goal is to foster an environment that is devoid of any form of intimidation, oppression, 
exploitation, discrimination, and harassment across the entire organisation.
Vedanta firmly acknowledges the necessity of creating a secure environment where employees can voice their concerns 
without fear of adverse repercussions. Therefore, Vedanta strictly maintains confidentiality regarding employee 
information disclosed during investigations. This approach is designed to protect the complainant and witnesses from any 
potential disadvantages or adverse outcomes. In accordance with the POSH policy, Vedanta takes decisive measures to 
safeguard individuals who lodge complaints from any form of victimisation or retaliation.
Vedanta has constituted an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC), in line with the Sexual Harassment of Women at 
Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act 2013, to address all complaints related to harassment, sexual as well 
as non-sexual in nature. The complaint shall be reported to the ICC constituted or shall be e-mailed to sexualharrassment@
vedanta.co.in, and the Company policies have a well-defined procedure in place to resolve such cases.
To ensure awareness and sensitivity towards these issues, we provide sensitisation and training programs to all 
employees. These initiatives will be coordinated with the Human Resources department and other relevant functions to 
ensure comprehensive coverage across the Company.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If yes, then provide details.
	
Vedanta’s greenhouse gas emission reduction strategy is designed to align with the goals of the Paris Agreement and 
prioritise the transition to a lower-carbon economy. The roadmap consists of four key stages:
	
Stage I: From 2021 to 2025, the company aims to reduce GHG intensity (measured in tCO2e/MT) of its metal businesses 
by 20% compared to the FY 2020-21 baseline.
	
Stage II: Between 2021 and 2030, there is a focus on creating renewable energy capacity, with the goal of establishing 
enough capacity to provide 2.5 GW of round-the-clock (RTC) renewable power for its facilities by FY 2029-30.
	
Stage III: From 2026 to 2030, the aim is to achieve a 25% reduction in absolute GHG emissions compared to FY 2020-21 
levels. This reduction will be measured against the baseline as the company actively pursues decarbonisation efforts.
	
Stage IV: Beyond 2030, the company plans to intensify the deployment of emerging technologies and expand its 
renewable energy capacities further, with the aim of becoming a net-zero carbon business by FY 2049-50.
	
Our significant achievements over the recent years include introducing our first low-carbon aluminium products, “Restora” 
and “Restora Ultra”, both low-carbon products and a pilot project for producing copper from recycled copper. We are in 
process of implementing fuel switching programme, by using biomass in thermal power plants and reducing our carbon 
footprint. In FY 2023-24, Vedanta Aluminium has dispatched its first domestic supply of Restora, the nation’s first-ever 
low-carbon ‘green’ aluminium, to Global Aluminium Pvt Ltd. As part of the order, the company will supply 300 metric tons 
of Restora Billets to Global Aluminium, making it the first domestic customer of what is likely among the most sustainable 
products from the domestic primary aluminium industry.
	
During FY 2023-24, we have implemented the following key initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions:
	•
Reduction of met coke consumption per metric ton of slag by ~2% at HZL’s Dariba Smelting Complex, resulting in GHG 
emissions reduction of ~32,000 tCO2e.
	•
Reduction in the average specific power consumption of zinc melting and casting furnaces at HZL’s Pantnagar plant by 
6%, thereby reducing GHG emissions by 4,00,00 tCO2e.
	•
Reduction in average specific power norms of silver plant by 5%, resulting in GHG emissions reduction of 
~2,00,000 tCO2e.
	•
At Cairn’s MBA-block, the conversion of a pump from PF to motor has resulted in GHG reductions of ~50,000 tCO2e.
	•
At ESL, in the Waste Heat Recovery system, the insulation of the boiler has resulted in more than 2,01,000 tCO2e of 
GHG reduction.
	•
At BALCO, the procurement of Renewable Energy has resulted in GHG reduction of more than 2,11,000 tCO2e.
	•
At the Value-Added-Business of Sesa Iron Ore, multiple initiatives to enhance the efficiency of the Waste Heat Recover 
system has reduced GHG emissions by more than 1,50,000 tCO2e.

10. 	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by 
your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices 
adopted to manage such wastes.
	
Waste management stands as a pivotal focus area, with waste categorised as a significant indicator.
	
Our waste management framework adheres to the principles of minimisation, optimisation, and circularity, aimed at 
reducing waste generation while promoting recycling and recovery processes. This strategic approach not only maximises 
benefits but also substantially lowers operational costs by curbing expenses related to raw material consumption, waste 
disposal, and energy usage across our operations. Our ultimate objective at Vedanta is to evolve into a 'zero-waste' 
organisation. We are actively embracing new technologies in our waste management procedures to eliminate waste 
to landfills or incinerators while ensuring alignment with the best industrial practices and relevant legal requirements 
governing various waste categories.
	
The Guidance Notes and Technical Standards on Solid Waste Management delineate comprehensive procedures for waste 
identification, classification, segregation, handling, storage, treatment, and disposal, both on-site and off-site, in a safe and 
sustainable manner. Our waste storage areas undergo weekly inspections, with meticulous documentation of records. 
Action points are identified, tracked, and addressed accordingly.
	
The Company’s hazardous waste strategy emphasises the safe storage and segregation of hazardous materials to 
facilitate recycling where feasible. Storage areas for hazardous waste are required to display detailed information about 
the materials stored, including material safety data sheets (MSDSs) and relevant precautions. These areas must feature 
appropriate warning signs in English and the local language, be securely locked to prevent unauthorised access, and be 
equipped with emergency wash facilities and spill cleanup kits. Access is restricted to only those authorised personnel 
who have undergone proper training. Hazardous waste generation is documented using Form 3 and disposed of in 
accordance with Hazardous Waste authorisation, either through recycling, co-processing, or other approved methods 
handled by State Pollution Control Board authorised vendors, with records maintained via Form 10. Site-specific SOPs are 
established for managing Hazardous and Toxic Chemicals. Quarterly hazardous waste management audits are conducted, 
with subsequent actions aimed at minimising hazardous waste usage.
	
At Vedanta, we are committed to leveraging all non-hazardous waste, exemplified by one of our units, TSPL, securing 
'Single Use Plastic Free' certification from the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII). Recognising the criticality of 
hazardous waste management, we are dedicated to recycling and circularity initiatives, including:
	•
Collaboration with organisations and research institutions to develop tailored recycling and reusing options. For 
instance, partnering with NHAI to utilise fly ash as construction material, thereby enhancing construction quality and 
conserving soil quality in adjacent areas.
	•
Incorporating ore-processing wastes like Jarosite and Jarofix into construction material.
	•
Undertaking R&D to explore the potential of red mud as an alternative construction material.
	•
Achievements in waste utilisation, such as 18.6 million tonnes of HVLT waste utilisation (94% for FY 2023-24), 
16.5 million tonnes utilisation for Fly Ash (108%), and reduction of legacy waste from 44.42 million tonnes to 
45.62 million tonnes.
	•
With the commissioning of Fumer plant, there will be complete elimination of Jarosite generation from one of the 
Hydro Zinc Smelter and generated slag will be 100% utilised in cement industries, for effective metal recovery, a second 
ancillary plant commissioned for treatment of process residues at Chanderiya Lead-Zinc Smelter; a project to recover 
sodium sulphate crystal from RO Reject commissioned at Dariba Zinc Smelter; gainfully utilised waste such as Jarosite, 
Jarofix, slag and fly ash in cement manufacturing and road construction, also tailings used in back-filling voids in mines 
through Paste fill/Hydrofill.

With respect to the ecologically sensitive areas reported at Question 11 of Essential Indicators above, provide details of 
significant direct & indirect impact of the entity on biodiversity in such areas along-with prevention and remediation activities.
	
Significant direct impact on biodiversity
	•
Construction activities, along with dust, pollution, and emissions, can directly impact natural ecosystems, leading to 
loss and degradation of natural habitats or disruption of wildlife migration and movement patterns. Vehicular traffic 
involved in the project poses a direct threat to wildlife, leading to collisions that cause injury or death. Transport 
associated with the project can also accidentally introduce invasive plants or animals, which can outcompete native 
species and disrupt ecosystem balance.
	
Significant indirect impact on biodiversity
	•
Ecosystem fragmentation - The development of mining infrastructure in the proximity of biodiversity rich areas can 
indirectly cause habitat fragmentation - affecting migration patterns of wildlife.
	•
Invasive species - The disturbance of land and increased human activity associated with mining can indirectly facilitate 
the introduction and spread of invasive species and alter ecosystem dynamics.
	•
Changes in land use patterns - Mining activities can indirectly lead to changes in land use. For example, conversion 
of agricultural land for mining activities can affect traditional livelihoods - and in case of proximity to forest areas - 
potentially displace such activities and lead to deforestation or encroachment.
	•
Socio-economic impacts - The presence of mining operations can indirectly lead to population influx - leading to 
increased demand for resources and resulting in additional pressure on local ecosystems and biodiversity.
	
Prevention and remediation activities
	
Vedanta has taken steps to mitigate the direct and indirect impacts emphasises preventing pollution, strictly regulating 
vehicle routes, and minimising environmental disturbances through a comprehensive Environmental Management Plan 
(EMP). Vedanta aims at creating net positive results for biodiversity through actions that include restoring soil and water 
bodies, removing invasive species, replanting native vegetation, and restoring wildlife habitats and corridors. There is 
an additional focus on supporting the conservation of endangered species, awareness campaigns, and community 
engagement as a part of its biodiversity management.

Describe the mechanisms to receive and redress grievances of the community.
Vedanta’s technical standard details the mechanism for grievance redressal from external stakeholders including 
communities. Concerns raised from the communities are primarily received and addressed at site level to ensure an ease 
of accessibility and transparency. During the engagement process conducted by the Company, the Community Liaison 
Officer (CLO) communicate the grievance mechanism. The redressal procedure follows a seven-step approach i.e., 
Receive, Acknowledge, Assess and Assign, Investigate, Respond, Resolve/Recourse and Close-out.
A grievance box is kept outside the plant's main gate, allowing stakeholders to submit written grievances in the local 
language. Every effort is made to resolve reported grievances at the initial stage, directly between the complainant and the 
Company. All complaints are acknowledged within 24 hours or a maximum of two business days, with updates provided 
every 30 days. Complaints are then forwarded to relevant departments for investigation, where the validity is verified, 
causes are identified, and corrective actions are developed to prevent recurrence. The CLO provides responses to raised 
complaints and ensures discussions with the concerned parties. A Resolution Form is signed by the complainant, outlining 
agreed-upon actions and their completion timeline.
However, if the Company fails to deliver any resolution for whatsoever reason, an approach to a second order is taken and 
a third-party mediator is engaged with the due consent of the complainant. If the second order mechanism does not yield 
resolution, the last resort is engaging legally with a court protocol, which can be initiated by either party. Complaints and 
grievances escalated to the third order mechanism are beyond Vedanta’s control of Vedanta and have no time limit due to 
lack of the company’s control over the resolution process.
Each Vedanta Business Units maintains a record of all complaints and grievances received to assess nature, analyze any 
patterns, identify training needs and for further references.

applicable Laws and Regulations, if any, related to reporting

includes design, implementation and maintenance of internal 
controls relevant to the preparation of BRSR, including BRSR 
Core and the measurement of BRSR Core, which is free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Inherent limitations
The absence of a significant body of established practice 
on which to draw to evaluate and measure non-financial 
information allows for different, but acceptable, measures 
and measurement techniques and can affect comparability 
between entities.
Our Independence and Quality Control
We have complied with the independence and other 
ethical requirements of the International Code of Ethics

Independence Standards) issued by the International Ethics 
Standards Board for Accountants (‘IESBA Code’), which is 
founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, 
professional competence, and due care, confidentiality, and 
professional behavior.

Emphasis of Matter
We draw your attention to the following matters:

The “Scope, Boundary and Limitations” in this report and 
the boundary, as mentioned in point no. 13 of Section 
A: General Disclosures of BRSR. These Entities/ Sites 
are considered for the reporting in BRSR as per the 
management’s assessment of materiality.
	•
The financial numbers used in some of the indicators 
of the BRSR Core are extracted from the Integrated 
Report and Annual Accounts FY 2023-24 and hence are 
not audited by us. While the financial numbers related 
to certain entities include inter-company consolidation 
adjustments as per the applicable financial reporting 
framework (net figures), the non-financial data used in 
some of the indicators of the BRSR Core related to these 
entities are given without adjustments (gross figures). 
Further, some of the Entities/ Sites are considered for the 
purpose of said financial numbers, which may have been 
excluded from the “Scope, Boundary and Limitations”.
	•
Some of the entities are considered for the purpose 
of preparation of the BRSR Core on full consolidation 
method, without adjusting for minority interest in the 
relevant group entity, based on operational control, as 
assessed by the management.
	•
The Non-Financial Reporting System used by the Group in 
the preparation of BRSR Core is in the advanced stage of 
implementation and is in the process of being integrated 
with other Financial and Non-Financial Reporting Systems 
of the Group.
	•
For the purpose of reporting under Principle 1.9 (Essential 
Indicator) of BRSR with respect to ‘number of trading 
houses where purchases are made from’ and ‘number of 
dealers and distributors to whom sales are made’, the data 
provided includes some duplicate numbers. The Company 
is in the process of setting up the mechanism to capture 
the required data going forward.
	•
For the purpose of reporting under Principle 3.1(c) 
(Essential Indicator) of BRSR with respect to ‘spending on 
measures towards well-being of employees’, the data for 
other than permanent workers have not been considered 
due to non-availability of information. The Company is in 
the process of setting up the mechanism to capture the 
required data going forward.
	•
For the purpose of reporting under Principle 8.5 (Essential 
Indicator) of BRSR with respect to ‘Job creation in smaller 
towns’, the data for other than permanent employees and 
other than permanent workers have not been considered 
due to non-availability of information. The Company is in 
the process of setting up the mechanism to capture the 
required data going forward.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of these matters.

on the requirements of:
	•
Regulation 34(2)(f) of the Securities and Exchange Board 
of India (the “SEBI”) (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements);
	•
Annexure I of SEBI’s Circular no. SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD-SEC-

format of BRSR Core);

Note for the pre-revised BRSR Format); and
	•
Nine Principles of the National Guidelines on Responsible 
Business Conduct, 2019 (‘NGRBC Guidelines’), issued by 
the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (‘MCA’).
Management’s Responsibilities
The Group’s management is responsible for establishing 
the “Criteria” for preparing Indicators other than BRSR Core, 
taking into account applicable Laws and Regulations, if any, 
related to reporting on Indicators other than BRSR Core, 
identification of key aspects, engagement with stakeholders, 
content, preparation and presentation of Indicators 
other than BRSR Core in accordance with the “Criteria”. 
This responsibility includes design, implementation and 
maintenance of internal controls relevant to the preparation 
of BRSR, including Indicators other than BRSR Core and the 
measurement of Indicators other than BRSR Core, which 
is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error.
Inherent limitations
The absence of a significant body of established practice 
on which to draw to evaluate and measure non-financial 
information allows for different, but acceptable, measures 
and measurement techniques and can affect comparability 
between entities.
Our Independence and Quality Control
We have complied with the independence and other 
ethical requirements of the International Code of Ethics 
for Professional Accountants (including International 
Independence Standards) issued by the International Ethics 
Standards Board for Accountants (‘IESBA Code’), which is 
founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, 
professional competence, and due care, confidentiality, and 
professional behavior.
Our firm applies International Standard on Quality 
Management (‘ISQM’) 1, “Quality Management for Firms 
that Perform Audits or Reviews of Financial Statements, or 
Other Assurance or Related Services Engagements” and 
accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality 
management, including documented policies and procedures 
regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional 
standards, and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
Our Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance 
conclusion on Indicators other than BRSR Core with respect 
to the Entities/ Sites covered in the “Scope, Boundary, and 
Limitations” paragraph given below, based on the procedures 
we have performed and evidence we have obtained.
We conducted our engagement in accordance with the 
International Standard on Assurance Engagements (‘ISAE’) 
3000 (Revised), “Assurance Engagements other than Audits 
or Reviews of Historical Financial Information”, issued by the 
International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. This 
standard requires that we plan and perform our engagement 
to obtain limited assurance about whether Indicators other 
than BRSR Core are free from material misstatement.
A limited assurance engagement involves assessing the 
suitability in the circumstances of the Company’s use of the 
Criteria as the basis for the preparation of Indicators other 
than BRSR Core whether due to fraud or error, responding to 
the assessed risks as necessary in the circumstances, and 
evaluating the overall presentation of the Indicators other 
than the BRSR Core.
A limited assurance engagement is substantially less in 
scope than a reasonable assurance engagement
in relation to both the risk assessment procedures, including 
an understanding of internal controls, and the procedures 
performed in response to the assessed risks.
Scope, Boundary and Limitations

– non-operational/ intermittent operational Entities/Sites; 
and
	
– Entities/Sites discontinued or outsourced.
Rest of the Entities/Sites considered for the preparation 
of Indicators other than BRSR Core are as per the 
management’s assessment of materiality, the details of 
which are given in the Appendix to this Report.
	•
The data review and validation of these Entities/ Sites was 
performed through physical site visits and/or together 
with desktop reviews.
Limitations
Our limited assurance scope excludes the following and 
therefore we do not express a limited assurance conclusion 
on the same:
	•
Operations of the Group other than those covered in the 
“Scope and Boundary”.
	•
Aspects of BRSR and the data/information (qualitative or 
quantitative) other than Indicators other than BRSR Core.
	•
Data and information outside the defined reporting period 
i.e., Financial Year 2023-24.
	•
The statements that describe expression of opinion, belief, 
aspiration, expectation, aim, or future intentions provided 
by the Group.
	•
Data related to Group’s financial performance, strategy 
and other related linkages expressed in the Group’s 
Integrated Report and Annual Accounts FY 2023-24 or any 
other Report, containing Indicators other than BRSR Core.
	•
Effectiveness of management’s internal controls of the 
Group, while we considered the same when determining 
the nature and extent of our procedures; however, our 
limited assurance engagement was not designed to 
provide assurance on these internal controls.
	•
The Group’s compliance with Acts, Regulations and 
Guidelines, other than those as specified in Indicators 
other than BRSR Core.
	•
Details of Scope 3 emissions.
Assurance Procedures
The procedures we performed were based on our 
professional judgment and included inquiries, observation of 
processes performed, inspection of documents, evaluating 
the appropriateness of quantification methods and reporting 
policies, analytical procedures and agreeing or reconciling 
with underlying records.
Given the circumstances of the engagement, in performing 
the procedures listed above, we:
	•
Obtained an understanding of the Group’s business 
activities, processes and its operating locations, as 
identified by the Group.
	•
Interviewed people involved to understand the reporting 
process, governance, data management systems and 
controls in place during the reporting period.
	•
Performed limited substantive testing on a sample basis 
of Indicators other than BRSR Core for the Entities/ Sites, 
as covered in the “Scope, Boundary and Limitations” 
to verify whether the data was appropriately recorded, 
collated, measured and reported with underlying 
supporting documents.

	•
Checked the consolidation for the Entities/ Sites as 
covered in the “Scope, Boundary and Limitations” for 
ensuring the completeness of data being reported.
	•
Assessed the level of adherence of the “Criteria”, as 
mentioned above by the Group while reporting.
	•
Verified the financial numbers which are also used for 
Indicators other than BRSR Core from the Integrated 
Report and Annual Accounts FY 2023-24.
	•
Assessed the appropriateness of various assumptions, 
estimations and thresholds used by the Group in the 
preparation of Indicators other than BRSR Core.
	•
Undertook analytical review procedures to support the 
reasonableness of the data used in Indicators other than 
BRSR Core.
	•
Obtained written representations from 
Group’s Management.
The procedures performed in a limited assurance 
engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less 
in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. 
Consequently, the level of assurance
obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially 
lower than the assurance that would have been obtained 
had we performed a reasonable assurance engagement. 
Accordingly, we do not express a reasonable assurance 
opinion about whether the Indicators other than BRSR Core 
have been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance 
with the Criteria.
Limited Assurance Conclusion
Based on the procedures we have performed and the 
evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our 
attention that causes us to believe that the Company’s 
Indicators other than BRSR Core included in the BRSR for the 
year ended 31 March 2024 are not prepared, in all material 
respects, in accordance with the “Criteria”.
Emphasis of Matter
We draw your attention to the following matters:
	•
The “Scope, Boundary and Limitations” in this report and 
the boundary, as mentioned in point no. 13 of Section 
A: General Disclosures of BRSR. These Entities/ Sites 
are considered for the reporting in BRSR as per the 
management’s assessment of materiality.
	•
The financial numbers used in some of the Indicators 
other than BRSR Core are extracted from the Integrated 
Report and Annual Accounts FY 2023-24 and hence are 
not audited by us. While the financial numbers related 
to certain entities include inter-company consolidation 
adjustments as per the applicable financial reporting 
framework (net figures), the non-financial data used in 
some of the Indicators other than BRSR Core related 
to these entities are given without adjustments (gross 
figures). Further, some of the Entities/ Sites are considered 
for the purpose of said financial numbers, which may 
have been excluded from the “Scope, Boundary and 
Limitations”.
	•
Some of the entities are considered for the purpose of 
preparation of the Indicators other than BRSR Core on 
full consolidation method, without adjusting for minority 
interest in the relevant group entity, based on operational 
control, as assessed by the management.
	•
The Non-Financial Reporting System used by the Group 
in the preparation of Indicators other than BRSR Core is 
in the advanced stage of implementation and is in the 
process of being integrated with other Financial and Non-
Financial Reporting Systems of the Group.
	•
The disclosures with respect to Value Chain Partners have 
been provided considering Tier 1 upstream Value Chain 
Partners only.
	•
For the purpose of reporting under Principle 3.8 (Essential 
Indicator) and Principle5.1 (Essential Indicator) with 
respect to ‘details of training given to employees and 
workers on Health and Safety measures and skill 
upgradation’ and ‘Employees and workers who have been 
provided training on human rights issues and policy(ies) 
of the entity’ respectively, the given percentage is more 
than 100%, owing to the fact that employees and workers 
have attended multiple trainings on the same topic and 
have been counted more than once. The Company is in 
the process of setting up the mechanism to capture the 
required data going forward.
	•
For the purpose of reporting under Principle 5.3(a) 
(Essential Indicator) with respect to ‘Details of 
remuneration/salary/wages’, the details of median of 
remuneration paid to workers has not been provided due 
to non-availability of information. The Company is in 
the process of setting up the mechanism to capture the 
required data going forward.
Our limited assurance conclusion is not modified in respect 
of these matters.
Restriction on Use
Our limited assurance report has been prepared and 
addressed to the Board of Directors of the Company at the 
request of the company solely to assist the Company in 
reporting on the Group’s Sustainability performance and 
activities. Our deliverables should not be used for any other 
purpose or by any person other than the addressees of 
our deliverables.
