the greenhouse effect, the Bank 
does not finance borrowers for 
setting up new units producing/
consuming Ozone Depleting 
Substances (ODS) and small/
medium scale units engaged in 
the manufacturing of aerosol 
units using Chlorofluorocarbons 
(CFC) which enables a reduction 
in the greenhouse effect.

Does the entity have processes in place to avoid/ manage conflict of interests involving members of the Board? (Yes/No) 
If Yes, provide details of the same.
Yes.
The Bank has a process in place to monitor and manage conflicts of interest involving members of the Board. As part

Bank’s policies before transacting with any individuals and entities in which directors are interested.
The ‘Code of Conduct and Ethics for the Board of Directors and senior management personnel of the Bank and the policy 
document on corporate governance, principles, and procedures apply to the board members and senior management. 
This includes explaining the circumstances to avoid, which may likely lead to a conflict of interest. Furthermore, the Bank 
obtains an annual declaration from all independent directors to the effect that they meet the criteria of independence 
as per SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, and the Companies Act, 2013.
 
 Additionally, the Bank, in compliance with ‘Para 10(ii) of RBI Circular No. DBOD.No.BP.BC.71/21.01.01/2004-05 dated 
February 28, 2005 – Guidelines on Ownerships and Governance in Private Sector Banks, conducts a fit and proper 
exercise on all the directors on an annual basis, with a cutoff date of 31st March to ensure that all the directors meet the 
‘Fit and Proper’ criteria to continue to hold the office of directorship of the Bank.
PRINCIPLE 2: Businesses should provide goods and services in a manner that is sustainable and safe.

and social issues, thereby indirectly reducing carbon footprints. 
The Bank is presently in the process of migrating from the Core Banking Solution ‘Maarvel’ to 
‘Oracle Flexcube’. Upon completion of this implementation, the Bank will be in a position to reduce 
environmental and social impacts further as ‘Oracle Flexcube’ is recognised as a top-tier Core 
Banking Solution that complies with international standards.
