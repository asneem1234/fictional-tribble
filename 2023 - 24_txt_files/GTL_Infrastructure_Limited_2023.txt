DIRECTORS’ REPORT
contractual dues to the Company, including rent payable to landlords, which are pass through payments for the Company. The Company has 
requested Edelweiss Asset Reconstruction Company Limited (“EARC”) being Monitoring Institution, for making payments due to the landlords 
of the unoccupied sites, however, the same is yet to be approved. Further, resolution plans submitted by the Company included payment of rent 
to landowners. However, none of the resolution proposals were considered by the lenders. Due to non-receipt of the rental amounts from the 
discontinuing operators as per contractual arrangement, pending approval of payment requests of the Company with the Monitoring Institution 
and non-resolution of issue of unpaid liabilities towards unoccupied towers, the rentals to landlords for those unoccupied sites remained 
unpaid. As a result, such landlords initiated legal actions against the Company and its directors / officials. The no. of legal notices received 
by the Company from various landlords are 1,109 nos. in FY 2022- 2023 and 1,168 nos. in FY 2023-2024 respectively. The Company has 
responded to majority of such legal notices and as on March 31, 2024, 514 number of matters have been filed by various landlords before 
various judicial authorities and Company is defending the same.

The Indian telecom sector is on the path of higher earnings due to the

margin for telecom operators. Continued deployment of 5G by 2 leading 
operators, revival of another private operator with clear intent of network 
expansion and pan India 4G deployment underway by PSU telecom 
operator ushers in opportunities for our Company to add tenancy.
In pursuit of sustainable operations, we are reducing the consumption of 
fossil fuels while maintaining Uptime through improved electrification, 
superior battery banks and efficient operations. On a YoY basis, 3.25 
lakh litres of diesel consumption is reduced thereby reducing the carbon

PRINCIPLE 6 Businesses should respect and make efforts to protect and restore the environment
The Company’s business has a dependence on availability of electricity on 24x7 basis. To achieve this, back-up power is provided 
from Battery Banks and Diesel generators at sites for the telecom networks to remain live in the event of electricity grid failure, 
force majeure events etc.
As a part of our endeavour for cleaner environment, the Company has been consistently working towards reducing its energy 
dependence on Diesel. Several measures have been adopted like installation of free cooling devices, battery augmentation, 
electrification of sites, working with electricity providers to improve the electricity availability, etc.
Waste management is also done in a responsible manner. Redeployment of sizeable no. of batteries, SMPS, Diesel Generators, 
Rectifier Modules, Air-conditioners by refurbishing to enhance their useful life without compromising much on desired performance 
instead of disposing as scarp.

Post receipt of material at warehouse, it flows into the process of Health Assessment which is done by In-house Testing & 
Repair Centre followed by its validation item wise by a Subject Matter Expert for declaring it as either repairable / reusable (with 
acceptable performance) or scrap.
