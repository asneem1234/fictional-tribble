Climate 
Change   
Risk
Climate change poses risks to Paras 
Defence, impacting operations, supply 
chains, and financial stability. Additionally 
increase in operating costs and  geopolitical 
dynamics 
could 
necessitate 
costly 
innovation and adaptation.
We evaluated the climate change risk 
exposure of all our operational sites 
and developed a plan to mitigate the 
potential impacts. The Company ensures 
that 
energy-efficient 
equipment 
is 
installed across its manufacturing units. 
The maintenance team is in charge of 
overseeing this and considerations such 
as energy ratings are taken into account 
during the procurement process.

Corporate 
Governance
Opportunity
We have a highly experienced management 
team, with our promoters having over 
three decades of expertise in the design, 
development and manufacturing of a 
wide range of engineering products for the 
defence and space sectors. This extensive 
experience has allowed us to establish 
strong, 
long-term 
relationships 
with 
customers and suppliers. The company has 
also assembled a skilled management and 
execution team, including many former 
employees from BEL and DRDO, further 
strengthening its industry capabilities.

Employee 
Satisfaction 
and 
Wellness
Opportunity
Focusing on employee satisfaction and 
wellness offers significant opportunities, 
including enhanced productivity, innovation 
and operational resilience. Prioritizing 
employee well-being also aids in attracting 
and retaining top talent, reduces turnover, 
and strengthens the company’s reputation 
as a responsible employer. Additionally, 
wellness initiatives can lower healthcare 
costs, reduce absenteeism, and improve 
stress 
management, 
all 
contributing 
to 
better 
financial 
performance 
and 
sustainable growth.

Environment

Waste and

Opportunity 
and Risk
Proactively 
managing 
environmental 
impact can lead to enhanced regulatory 
compliance, cost savings and improved 
reputation, positioning the company as a 
sustainability leader. This focus can also 
drive innovation, opening new market 
opportunities and future-proofing the 
business. However, failure to effectively 
manage these metrics could result in 
regulatory penalties, increased operational 
costs, reputational damage, and potential 
competitive disadvantages, making it 
crucial for us to balance these factors.
The company has a proven waste 
management practice in place that 
makes sure that proper waste removal 
as per the waste category defined by 
the MPCB and State Pollution Control 
Board(s) is carried out.

By prioritizing continuous improvement 
and keeping up with the latest technological 
advancements, businesses can develop 
innovative products that cater to changing

and nurturing a culture of creativity and 
collaboration can result in a competitive 
edge, customer allegiance and market 
expansion.

Customers who are satisfied with our 
products and services tend to demonstrate

positive customer behavior can drive 
increased sales and help build a strong 
brand reputation. At the same time 
the Company caters to a diverse global 
clientele. 
Any 
undesirable 
customer 
experience could lead to customer attrition

LI-1.	 Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and social topics or if 
consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.
 
The Company actively engages with stakeholders to enhance performance and create value for both the ecosystem and its operations. 
Engagement methods differ based on the stakeholder group.  Senior management conducts regular meetings with various stakeholders. 
Shareholders, investors, and analyst investors are involved through Group Meetings, Annual General Meetings, and grievance channels 
such as the Scores Portal, email, and phone calls. While sustainability is an important topic, the main focus remains on strategy and 
performance. Customer feedback is collected through meetings, emails and phone calls that address customer service, complaints 
and new product offerings. Employee engagement is a priority, using various platforms and communication channels. This includes 
addressing concerns, providing feedback and evaluations, sharing updates via email, holding team meetings and organizing awareness 
programs.  The Company aims to understand stakeholders' expectations and requirements related to Environmental, Social, and 
Governance (ESG) issues, thereby enhancing the value delivered to stakeholders. 
LI-2. Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, and social topics (Yes / No). 
If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these topics were incorporated into policies and 
activities of the entity.
	
Engagement with communities primarily involves discussions where their views and opinions on CSR programs are carefully considered. 
The formulation of Company policies related to Corporate Social Responsibility has been the outcome of ongoing interactions with 
the stakeholders.   The discussions with employees, HR, and team leads have also enabled the Company to implement activities like 
employee well-being programs, while also promoting environmental initiatives such as water, electricity and fuel conservation.
LI-3. Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/ marginalized stakeholder groups.
 
The Company actively involves its vulnerable/ marginalized stakeholder groups, particularly communities through the CSR initiatives 
and improving livelihoods for the target beneficiaries. It also prioritizes keeping stakeholders informed about new technologies, safety 
measures and industry developments aimed at mitigating risks. Proactive engagement yields valuable insights that inform material issues, 
shape business strategy and operations, and mitigate reputational risks. Committing to fostering positive relationships, the Company 
engages extensively with all stakeholders, including vulnerable and marginalized groups, on various issues. This is mainly done through: 
 
 − Volunteering activities to address local needs of the beneficiaries. 
 
− CSR initiatives with regard to animal welfare, conserving water resources, and promoting health and education. 
 
− By contributing towards environmental sustainability.
