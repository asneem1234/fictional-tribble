Responsible 
supply chain 
management
Risk
Risk: Strong dependency 
on the supply chain for the 
entire product life cycle 
poses a requirement of a 
strong contingency plan to 
deal with unprecedented 
situations 
which 
may 
lead to disruption in the 
supply 
chain. 
Further, 
the 
Company 
extends 
its responsible business 
principles 
across 
the 
value chain, expecting its 
suppliers to adhere with the 
required principles. Non-
adherence of the principles 
from the supplier end may 
affect 
the 
Company’s 
partnership 
with 
them, 
further 
impacting 
the 
business continuity plan.
1.	 Establish 
a 
robust 
a s s e s s m e n t 
mechanism to assess 
the 
implication 
of 
u n p r e c e d e n t e d 
disruption on the supply 
chain 
and 
develop 
a 
comprehensive 
contingency 
plan 
to 
avoid major impact on 
the business.
2. Undertake a supplier 
assessment 
in 
alignment 
with 
the 
standard practices and 
requirements as per 
the guidance outlined 
by 
sector 
specific 
responsible 
supply 
chain initiatives.
Positive: 
Responsible 
supply 
chain 
practices 
enables the Company to 
have a strong mechanism 
to 
deal 
with 
supply 
chain disruptions due to 
unprecedented situations, 
moreover the compliance 
with 
the 
Company’s 
responsible 
business 
practices and principles, 
amplify 
the

Describe the mechanisms to receive and redress grievances of the community. 
	
The Company has established a robust process dedicated to receiving and effectively addressing concerns and grievances 
from the community. To ensure a comprehensive approach, a site-level committee is formed, comprising representatives 
from key departments such as administration, security, CSR, and the SWOT committee. This diverse team is entrusted with 
the task of receiving both written and verbal concerns, and subsequently, orchestrating their prompt resolution.
	
The resolution process entails a collaborative field visit or investigation, wherein the committee collectively assesses the 
situation. This proactive approach ensures that concerns are met with appropriate actions within a reasonable timeframe. 
Notably, each concern is meticulously documented and monitored until its final closure, demonstrating the Company’s 
commitment to accountability and transparency.
	
Moreover, the Company goes beyond mere grievance resolution. As part of its community development initiatives, proactive 
engagement with the community is a cornerstone. Throughout the year, a dynamic calendar of informal and formal sessions 
is curated, fostering meaningful interactions between the Company and the community. These sessions complement 
dedicated program-specific meetings, all of which synergistically contribute to effective collaboration.
	
The engagement strategy is thoughtfully tailored to engage different segments of the community. This includes targeted 
outreach to youth, women, and community leaders. The involvement of senior leadership further underlines the Company’s 
genuine commitment, as they regularly connect with the community, reinforcing a sense of partnership and mutual 
understanding.
