In our waste management strategy, we utilize advanced technologies such as Effluent Treatment Plants (ETP) and 
pollution control equipment to reduce carbon emissions and capture carbon particles using bag filters for reuse in 
the printing cartridge industry. We implement a Reverse Osmosis (RO) plant to reuse industrial wastewater, reducing 
groundwater consumption. Additionally, we recycle slag metal and incorporate recycled steel scrap, lowering CO2 
emissions and promoting circular economy principles. We also employ wet scrubbers to control zinc and acid waste 
and use multi-cyclone dust collectors in our galvanizing units to manage emissions. These efforts contribute to 
creating a sustainable environment for our community.
