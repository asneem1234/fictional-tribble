Annual Report 2023-24
26.	 Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues
	
Please indicate material responsible business conduct and sustainability issues pertaining to environmental and social mat-
ters that present a risk or an opportunity to your business, rationale for identifying the same, and approach to adapt or miti-
gate the risk along with its financial implications, as per the following format
Material 
issue 
identified
Indicate 
whether 
risk or 
opportunity 
(R/O)
Rationale for identifying
 the risk/opportunity
In case of risk, 
approach to adapt or 
mitigate
Financial 
implications of the 
risk or opportunity 
(indicate positive 
or negative 
implications)
Extended 
product 
approval 
process
Risk
It is a long process to get approval 
from regulatory authorities for a new 
product. For this reason, end-users of 
additives generally prefer established 
organisation’s 
with 
all 
formalities/
certifications in place. This stands as a 
barrier for an additive manufacturer trying 
to enter new geographies  and reach out 
to new customers, as country-specific 
approval is required and each country has 
different parameters for approval
• Understanding 
the 
approval process in detail 
and having in place all 
certificates required, will 
expedite the process
• Focus 
on 
improving 
communication with all 
relevant 
stakeholders, 
both 
locally 
and 
internationally
Negative-
Revenue loss for the 
organisation
Vegetable oil 
prices
Risk
Fluctuations in vegetable oil prices due to 
fluctuating demand and supply indirectly 
affect the financial performance of the 
organisation 
• Keeping sufficient stock 
of raw materials so that 
the organisation is not 
affected by sudden market 
fluctuations
• Maintaining 
robust 
relationships 
with 
key 
suppliers
Negative- 
Rising 
costs 
of 
raw 
materials 
can 
lead 
to 
diminished 
profit 
margins 
and 
adversely 
impact 
the 
organisation's financial 
performance
Industry 
growth
Opportunity
End-users 
switching 
from 
synthetic 
and conventional materials to organic 
and 
natural 
additives, 
incorporating 
sustainable and environmentally friendly 
materials into their processes
–
Positive-
Higher demand will lead 
to increased revenue
Customer 
specification
Opportunity
By paying attention to each customer's 
unique 
requirements 
and 
delivering 
tailored 
solutions, 
the 
Company 
establishes a bond of trust between the 
organisation and the customer
–
Positive-

Indicate 
whether 
risk or

(R/O)
Rationale for identifying
 the risk/opportunity
In case of risk, 
approach to adapt or 
mitigate
Financial 
implications of the 
risk or opportunity 
(indicate positive 
or negative 
implications)
Impact of 
climate change
Risk
The business may face challenges due 
to 
adverse 
weather 
conditions 
and 
climate change, as these factors can 
have an impact on crop production. Since 
vegetable oils, which are key raw materials 
for the industry, are derived from crops, 
any negative effects on  them can affect 
their availability. Additionally, climate 
change and related natural disasters 
like floods, cyclones, and droughts can 
introduce volatility in raw material prices, 
potentially influencing farmers' decisions. 
Such disruptions can also impact supply 
chains, production facilities, and even 
customer demand and preferences
• Sustainable sourcing from 
developed key suppliers 
can mitigate risks for the 
Company by ensuring a 
stable and reliable supply 
of raw materials while 
promoting environmental 
stewardship and resilience
• Improvement in processes 
to generate less emissions
• Sustainable 
logistics 
management
Negative-
Most suppliers opt for 
short-term 
contracts 
spanning 3 to 6 months, 
occasionally extending 
to 12 months when 
required, 
owing 
to 
global uncertainties
Health & 
safety
Risk
In the chemical industry, health & 
safety can cause a potential harm to 
individuals and communities, operational 
disruptions, regulatory non-compliance 
consequences, and reputation damage. 
Proactive risk management and adherence 
to safety protocols are essential to 
mitigate these risks effectively and ensure 
business sustainability
• Prioritising 
safety 
protocols and regulatory 
compliance
• Identifying and mitigating 
operational hazards
• Ensuring 
swift 
incident 
response and containment
• Providing comprehensive 
safety 
education 
and 
awareness
• Integrating 
lessons 
learned for ongoing safety 
enhancement
Negative-
Health 
and 
safety 
incidents 
can 
lead 
to 
financial 
losses 
through 
regulatory 
fines, legal liabilities, 
production shutdowns, 
and 
damage 
to 
facilities, impacting the 
Company's profitability, 
reputation, and market 
competitiveness
Regulatory 
issues and 
compliance
Risk
Failure to comply with regulatory 
issues not only causes risks of legal 
repercussions but also undermines 
the Company's reputation. Given the 
industry's sensitivity to safety and 
environmental concerns, any deviation 
could erode trust among stakeholders, 
affecting market presence and financial 
stability
• Ensuring 
adherence 
to 
compliance 
monitoring 
system
Negative-
Non-compliance  can lead 
to fines, legal expenses, 
and production delays 
for the Company, while 
tarnishing 
the 
brand 
image 
and 
reducing 
customer 
trust, 
impacting 
financial 
performance
Reducing 
carbon 
footprint
Opportunity
Ensuring the reduction of carbon footprint 
helps to align with global sustainability 
objectives and mitigates the effects of 
global climate change while fostering 
innovation 
–
Positive-
Reducing the carbon 
footprint 
can 
yield 
positive 
financial 
outcomes and enhance 
brand reputation

Does the entity have processes in place to avoid/manage conflict of interests involving members of the Board? (Yes/No) 
If yes, provide details of the same. 
Yes.
All the Directors of the Company transparently disclose their interests within the Company and any potential conflict of 
interest with other companies, corporate bodies, firms, or other associations of individuals, annually or as changes occur. To 
ensure ethical governance, the Company has instituted a Policy on Materiality of Related Party Transactions, applicable to 
the Company. Transactions involving board members or entities they have affiliations are required to obtain the necessary 
approval from the Audit Committee or Board. During discussions on such matters, the concerned Directors recuse themselves. 
To detect and monitor conflict of interest among the Company's Directors and Key Management Personnel (KMPs), the 
Corporate Secretarial team oversees a database listing the Directors and their associated entities. This information is then 
provided to the finance department, which identifies these parties within their system. This facilitates the monitoring and 
tracking of any transactions initiated by the Company involving these parties.
Additionally, Directors annually affirm their commitment to act in the Company's best interests and avoid conflicts of 
interest. The Senior Management also confirms annually that they haven't engaged in any material, financial and commercial 
transactions that could conflict with the Company's interests. Moreover, during Board meetings, the Directors abstain from 
participating in discussions related to matters in which they have personal interests.

The Company fosters an environment of open communication, encouraging employees and workers to first address their 
concerns with their respective Heads of Department (HODs). Should the issue remain unresolved, they are welcome to report 
their complaints or problems to either the HR department or the plant in-charge.
In cases of sexual harassment or discrimination, victims or witnesses have the option to lodge a complain, either anonymously 
or with their name, to the Internal Complaint Committee (ICC) and they take further action to address and resolve the matter.
To ensure the genuine reporting of concerns or grievances, the Audit Committee has been tasked with establishing a 
vigil mechanism. Moreover, the Company strictly adheres to the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, 
Prohibition, and Redressal) Act of 2013. As part of the Company's commitment to addressing such issues effectively, an 
external member, knowledgeable in the Prevention of Sexual Harassment (POSH) and Protection of Children against Sexual 
Offences Acts (POCSO), has been appointed to the Internal Complaint Committee.

Yes, The process effluent quantities are minimum, and whatever effluent gets generated at facility undergo treatment in the 
Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP). Out of the total of seven manufacturing units, six facilities and one R&D center have already 
implemented Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) and the treated effluent is subsequently recycled as makeup water for cooling 
towers or other utility needs. The ZLDs consist of primary, secondary and tertiary treatment and followed by the Agitated 
Thin Film Dryer (ATFD). 
	
The only exception is an old small-scale manufacturing unit located in Badlapur, which currently discharges treated effluent 
into CETP for further disposal. 
	
Domestic effluents or sewage undergoes treatment in the dedicated Sewage Treatment Plant (STP). The STP consists of 
primary, secondary and tertiary treatment followed by UV treatment. Treated domestic effluent is utilised for gardening 
purposes. Bio-sludge generated during the treatment process is utilised as manure. In the case of smaller units, sewage is 
collected in septic tanks and subsequently directed to soak pits.
