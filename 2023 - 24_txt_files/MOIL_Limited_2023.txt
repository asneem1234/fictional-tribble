Business Responsibility 
and Sustainability 
Report for 2023-24
In recent times, there has been a notable trend in the business realm towards adopting 
environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles. ESG embodies a framework 
urging companies to evaluate their environmental impact, stakeholder relations, and 
overall governance and ethical standards. This heightened awareness has prompted 
MOIL to take tangible actions towards integrating ESG strategies. We are now prioritizing 
sustainable initiatives such as minimizing carbon footprints, adopting renewable energy 
sources, and optimizing resource consumption. Moreover, we are increasingly dedicated 
to cultivating inclusive and diverse workplaces, ensuring equitable labour practices, 
and fostering community engagement. Furthermore, we are enhancing governance 
structures with transparent reporting and accountability mechanisms. These endeavours 
towards ESG signify a broader acknowledgment of the intertwined nature of business 
prosperity and environmental and social welfare.

Presently, 70% of the mines operated by MOIL are 
situated underground, contributing to 65% of the 
overall production. MOIL is intensifying its efforts to 
increase production and uphold ore quality by delving 
deeper into existing mines and constructing new 
vertical shafts for entry and capacity augmentation. 
However, this strategy may present safety risks for 
workers employed in these mines.

of adequate safety standards to 
prevent accidents and conducts fire

Environmental 
Impact and 
Sustainability
Risk
The extraction and processing of manganese ore can 
have significant environmental impacts, including 
habitat destruction, soil erosion, water contamination, 
and air pollution. Increasing regulatory scrutiny and 
growing societal expectations for sustainable practices 
pose risks for mining companies that do not adequately 
address environmental concerns.
Non-hazardous waste (rocks used for 
landfilling and backfilling) is reused by 
the entity.
Plantation area is maintained by 
watering the area regularly around all 
the mine sites.
The entity generates electricity through 
renewable energy sources such as 
Solar panels and Wind mills. Also, all 
the mining sites and the head office 
have vast areas dedicated to plantation 
activities.
The 
organization 
has 
effectively 
established a Zero Liquid Discharge 
mechanism across all its mines, 
encompassing 
Sewage 
Treatment 
Plants and Effluent Treatment Plants. 
The treated water is repurposed for 
gardening, 
plantation, 
green 
belt 
maintenance, and dust suppression 
purposes. Additionally, the head office 
is equipped with a Sewage Treatment 
Plant, and the treated water is utilized 
for gardening and plantation.

11. 
Technological 
and Process 
Innovation
Opportunity
The manganese ore industry can benefit significantly 
from advancements in mining technologies and 
processing techniques. Innovations such as automated 
mining equipment, advanced ore beneficiation methods, 
and energy-efficient processing technologies can 
improve productivity, reduce costs, and enhance the 
quality of manganese ore products. MOIL should invest 
in research and development to adopt and integrate the 
latest technologies and processes, thereby maintaining 
competitive advantage and operational efficiency.

MOIL Limited, a mining company, is primarily involved in the exploration, extraction, and production of manganese ore, as well as 
Manganese Ore, Electrolytic Manganese Dioxide, and Ferro Manganese. Due to the nature of mining operations, where ore is extracted 
and processed to obtain valuable minerals, there are limited opportunities for reclaiming products for reuse, recycling, or disposal at the 
end of their life cycle. Unlike certain manufacturing sectors that can recycle or repurpose their products, mining processes often entail the 
extraction of non-renewable resources, making it challenging to recover and recycle materials at the end of their useful life. Nevertheless, 
MOIL is committed to implementing sustainable practices in its operations, minimizing environmental impacts, and adhering to responsible 
mining standards to ensure long-term ecological balance and conservation of natural resources.

Health and safety management system:
a.	
Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been   implemented by the entity? (Yes/ No). If yes, the coverage 
such system? 
	
MOIL prioritizes the health and safety of its employees and workers, exemplified by its extensive health camp dedicated to occupational 
disease checkups. This initiative ensures regular health assessments for the workforce, allowing proactive identification and management of 
potential occupational health concerns. The program comprises both Initial Medical Examination (IME) and Periodical Medical Examination 
(PME), with individuals below 45 undergoing assessments every 5 years and those above 45 every 3 years.
	
Moreover, the company underscores its commitment to the well-being of workers operating heavy vehicles by conducting annual eye 
checkups for them. Additionally, MOIL is devoted to providing essential life-saving skills to its workers through comprehensive training 
programs. All employees receive training on rescuing injured colleagues during emergencies, ensuring they are prepared to offer immediate 
assistance when needed. Furthermore, workers undergo training to effectively respond to critical situations like fires and roof collapses, 
fostering a culture of safety and preparedness throughout all mining operations.
b.	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by the entity?
	
The company emphasizes the reliability and efficiency of its machinery and equipment through meticulous maintenance practices. Regular 
maintenance checks are conducted to ensure that machines operate optimally, thereby reducing the risk of unexpected breakdowns and 
minimizing disruptions to operations. Swift repair of any malfunctioning equipment is a priority to swiftly resume operations and prevent 
potential delays and productivity losses.
	
To uphold the integrity and safety of operational zones, the company conducts regular pressure tests to assess the structural integrity of 
equipment and pipelines. This preventive measure helps identify potential leaks or weaknesses before they pose safety risks.
	
Furthermore, the company utilizes Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) for critical equipment. NDT is a valuable inspection technique that allows 
the company to assess the condition of essential equipment without causing damage. Through NDT tests, MOIL can detect any defects

or abnormalities in important machinery and make informed decisions about repairs or replacements, ensuring the continuous and safe 
operation of its mining processes.
c.	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such risks. (Y/N)
	
Each mine is equipped with a telephone in the communication area. In case of an injury or emergency, workers are trained to promptly 
report the incident to either the senior-most manager of the mine or the mine manager. Alternatively, they can contact any available 
supervisor on duty.
	
Upon receiving the report, the mine manager assumes responsibility for the situation and notifies the designated officer responsible for 
emergency response. The designated officer then follows the established Safe Operating Procedure (SOP) to evaluate the situation and 
decide on the best course of action for safely and efficiently rescuing the injured worker.
d.	
Do the employees/ worker of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services? (Yes/ No)
	
The company offers on-site medical facilities for immediate response and treatment of minor injuries or medical emergencies that can be 
managed within the mine premises.
	
However, in the case of a significant medical incident or when specialized medical care beyond the capabilities of the on-site facility is 
necessary, MOIL responsibly refers the affected individual to a hospital outside the mine. The company covers the expenses incurred for 
this external medical treatment..

Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its coverage and implementation. 
	
MOIL Limited has adopted the Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) policy, ensuring that no liquid waste is discharged into the environment. 
This policy is implemented across all 10 mines, where several measures have been put in place to manage both domestic sewage and 
industrial effluent.
	
Domestic Sewage Treatment
	
Adequate capacity Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) are installed in the mine colonies associated with each of the 10 mines. These STPs 
utilize Phytorid bed technology, designed by NEERI, Nagpur, to treat domestic sewage. The treated water is then repurposed for land 
irrigation, including gardening and plantation activities within the mine colonies.
	
Industrial Effluent Treatment
	
Industrial effluent generated at the mines' workshops is managed through Effluent Treatment Plants (ETPs) of sufficient capacity. The 
treated effluent is recycled and used for vehicle washing, minimizing the environmental impact and conserving water resources.
	
Protection of Natural Water Bodies
	
MOIL Limited ensures that intermittent and seasonal streams within the mine lease areas are protected from any mining discharges. 
Measures such as stone pitching, grassing, and the plantation of native species are practiced to prevent soil erosion and maintain the 
integrity of these water bodies. These efforts help sustain the natural ecosystem and prevent the degradation of land and water resources 
in the mining areas.

boutiques, making 44 families self- sufficient. By equipping girls with nursing qualifications, the Saksham Balika Programme also contributes to 
economic growth through skilled employment opportunities in the healthcare industry. It supports decent work by preparing participants for 
dignified and fulfilling careers.
Affordable and Clean Energy: The installation of 648 biogas units reduces reliance on coal and wood-fired Chullahs, providing clean fuel for 
cooking. This initiative not only improves air quality and health but also ensures a sustainable energy source for rural households. Additionally, 
we have installed rooftop solar systems and solar- powered streetlamps to promote renewable energy, ensuring safety and security for people 
at any given time of the day and resulting in significant community savings. To mitigate our environmental impact, we’re focusing on reducing 
energy consumption and promoting renewable energy sources. Efforts include upgrading to energy- efficient motors and transformers, and 
implementing automatic power factor correction (APFC) panels and active harmonic filters to improve power efficiency. We’re also procuring 
energy-efficient light fittings and expanding our use of solar and wind energy. This includes wind farms in Nagda Hills (4.8 MW) and Ratedi 
Hills (15.2 MW) in Madhya Pradesh, and solar power plants like a 5.0 MW facility in Maharashtra and a 5.5 MW plant in Madhya Pradesh. 
Additionally, we’re installing ground-mounted solar plants and solar trees to further advance our sustainable energy initiatives.
Good Health and Well-being: We set up regular medical diagnostic camps, provide ambulances, and sponsor free cataract surgeries, benefiting 
7,000 patients. We also supported pediatric surgeries for 450 children. During the pandemic, we established Covid Care Centres with necessary 
equipment, including a 350-bed facility in Mandla, Madhya Pradesh, and distributed dry rations and cooked food. We organized 33 general 
healthcare camps offering free check- ups and medicines for common ailments like diabetes, blood pressure, anemia, thyroid, and arthritis. In 
Nandurbar district, we supported pregnant women during and after their pregnancies with necessary tests and nutrition under the Yaha Mogi 
program, benefiting over 800 tribal women. In Gadchiroli district, we provided prosthetic limbs and mobility aids to differently abled people, 
benefiting 250 individuals with the help of ALIMCO.
Sustainable Cities and Communities: We contributed to the construction of RCC and Bituminous or tar roads and building systemic drainage 
systems to ensure accessibility and hygiene. We built community halls for various festivities and celebrations, installed solar-powered street 
lamps for better visibility and safety during night hours, and fitted grid-connected rooftop solar systems, resulting in community savings of up 
to H 10 Lakhs. These efforts enhance infrastructure and improve the quality of life in rural areas.

Quality Education: By sponsoring economically disadvantaged girls to pursue nursing studies at Apollo College of Nursing, the Saksham Balika 
Programme promotes inclusive and equitable quality education. It ensures that these girls have access to high-quality education and training, 
enhancing their skills and opportunities in the healthcare sector. The company has also established a school in collaboration with the DAV 
Group of Schools in Sitasaongi village, located in the Bhandara district. Additionally, plans are underway to inaugurate another branch of 
the school in Munsar, situated in the Nagpur district, with the aim of providing high-quality education to students residing in rural regions. 
Furthermore, the company extends support to numerous schools located near its mining sites.
Gender Equality: We focus on women’s health by distributing healthcare kits, promoting menstrual health awareness, and early screening 
for anemia and sickle cell conditions. Nutritional kits with iron-rich superfoods were provided to pregnant women, lactating mothers, and 
adolescent girls. Additionally, awareness programs on menstrual health and hygiene were organized, and menstrual kits were distributed to 
girls. To ensure year-round availability of nutritious food, we provided seeds for 13 types of vegetables and 7 types of fruits to 48 marginal 
families, benefiting over 200 people. We also organized 35 digital literacy camps in 22 villages, teaching women how to make digital 
transactions via BHIM, UPI, and other means. An “E-Dost,” a local banking aide, was appointed to facilitate these transactions, boosting morale 
and confidence, while making their money safer by raising awareness of banking hazards. Moreover, we organized a training program on Heavy 
Earth Moving Machinery (HEMM) for 30 female candidates, equipping them for jobs in various organizations. The Saksham Balika Programme 
empowers girls from families below the poverty line by providing them with educational opportunities in nursing. It promotes gender equality 
by enabling these girls to pursue careers in healthcare. MOIL, in collaboration with Asha Hospital, Kamptee, organized a “Medicine Diagnostic 
& Gynecology Camp” at Kandri Mine, MOIL Limited. The camp targeted female employees and their dependents from the mine. Its objective 
was to enhance awareness of personal health and encourage women to openly discuss sensitive issues. The camp addressed a range of 
gynecological concerns and imparted knowledge on health, hygiene, nutrition, exercise, and relaxation techniques.
Reduced Inequalities: Targeting economically disadvantaged girls from BPL families, the programme aims to reduce inequalities by providing 
them with access to education and employment opportunities that would otherwise be inaccessible due to financial constraints. MOIL LIMITED 
and Artificial Limb Manufacturing Company (ALIMCO) have also entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to extend support to 
Persons with Disabilities. The collaboration involves the provision of implants and related assistance in Balaghat, Bhandara, Nagpur, Gadchiroli
