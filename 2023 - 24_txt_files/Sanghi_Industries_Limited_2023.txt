The Business responsibility and Sustainability Report is 
one of the many steps we are taking for creating a greener 
future for our Company and the larger ecosystem. Our 
sustainability efforts go beyond using nature’s resources 
efficiently and staying compliant. It is our mission to 
create shared value by empowering our employees and 
communities to improve their lives, enabling our value chain 
partners to prosper as we expand our footprint and, above 
all, delivering quality products to our customers.
It is our goal to pave circular driven paths to produce 
cement with zero waste as much as feasible, reducing our 
carbon footprint and Green House Gas (GHG) emissions. 
Using recyclable industrials, reducing the use of coal and 
PET coke, modifying our product mix to include greener 
blended cement, and deploying waste heat recovery 
systems to reuse hot waste gas are just some of the 
measures we are taking to reduce our carbon footprint. In 
line with our efforts to decrease the production of waste 
and increase the adoption of alternative fuels and raw 
materials, we are in the process of commissioning solar and 
wind energy assets at our locations.
