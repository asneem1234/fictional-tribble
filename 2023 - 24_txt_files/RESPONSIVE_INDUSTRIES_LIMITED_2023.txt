The Company has in place a “Prevention of Sexual Harassment at Workplace (POSH) Policy”. The Company has 
constituted Internal Committee (IC) under Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition

victimized for doing so. Unfortunately, despite the best precautions, the complainant would be victimized; the IC 
will treat this as a serious offense and take disciplinary action against the perpetrator. The Company is committed 
to handle matters regarding sexual harassment with sensitivity and confidentiality will be maintained throughout 
the redressal process.
