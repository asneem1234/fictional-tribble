(Indicate positive or negative 
implications) 
1
Corporate 
Governance
Opportunity
Having well-defined policies 
and processes, along with 
a board of directors and 
executive 
managers 
who 
uphold a culture of compliance, 
directly 
contributes 
to 
improved outcomes. 
Organizations 
with 
strong 
corporate 
governance 
can 
secure funds at lower interest 
rates compared to those with 
weaker governance, as they are 
perceived as stable, reliable, 
and capable of mitigating 
potential risks.
To 
enhance 
corporate 
governance 
at 
Sammaan 
Capital, 
the 
company 
remains committed to its 
core values of Customer 
First, Transparency, Integrity, 
and 
Professionalism. 
The 
Board has been bolstered 
by the addition of highly 
experienced 
independent 
directors, with more than 
60% of the Board now 
consisting of Independent 
Directors. All key board 
committees are chaired by 
Independent Directors. The 
company also employs top-
tier 
information 
security 
practices and adopts leading 
data privacy standards.
Positive:
A robust Board and transparent 
operations will boost confidence 
among investors and other 
stakeholders
2
Priority Sector 
Lending
Opportunity
Priority sector lending within 
home 
loans 
focuses 
on 
affordable housing, assisting 
families in purchasing their 
first home and addressing the 
country's housing gap. 
Lending to small businesses 
and micro, small, and medium 
enterprises (MSMEs) is also 
part of priority sector lending, 
with MSMEs being a vital 
sector, contributing 30% of 
India’s GDP.
Sammaan 
Capital 
serves 
the credit to underserved 
population of smaller towns 
by establishing lean branches 
that leverage its eHome 
Loans 
technology. 
This 
initiative helps residents of 
these towns achieve their 
dream of homeownership. 
The organization provides 
small businesses and MSMEs 
with the opportunity to 
unlock the value of their 
property 
and 
access 
funding for their ventures at 
reasonable mortgage-backed 
finance rates. This support is 
crucial for the economic and 
social growth of the small 
business and MSME sectors 
in the country.
Positive:
By 
addressing 
the 
housing 
shortage in smaller towns, 
Sammaan Capital aids the credit 
underserved population and 
contributes to the Government’s 
'Housing for All' goal. Serving the 
credit needs of the crucial MSME 
sector 
supports 
economic 
growth 
and 
employment 
generation.

Customer

Risk and Opportunity
Opportunities: At the core of 
Sammaan Capital’s operations 
is a 'customer first' approach. 
In 
addition 
to 
prioritizing 
customer 
experience, 
the 
company strives to maintain 
transparency in its operations 
and communication.
RisŬ: As a provider of housing 
and 
mortgage-backed 
loan 
products 
and 
services 
to 
a large customer base, a 
negative customer experience 
could lead to customer loss or 
reputational damage.
All 
customer 
complaints 
received across branches and 
front channels are managed 
through 
a 
centralized 
complaints 
management 
system for tracking and timely 
resolution. Sammaan Capital 
is committed to ensuring 
customer satisfaction and 
aims to increase it from the 
current 95% to 100% by FY25.
Positive:
Satisfied 
customers 
reduce 
the churn rate and enhance 
brand loyalty. The organization 
aims to provide a hassle-free 
and 
smooth 
home-buying 
experience to its customers.

responsibility 
report, 
highlighting 
ESG 
-related 
challenges, targets, and 
achievements
At SCL, our steadfast dedication to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles 
remains a pivotal element of our business strategy for FY2024. We understand that sustainable 
practices are essential for creating enduring value for our stakeholders and the communities we 
serve. As a financially responsible institution, we are committed to advancing initiatives centered 
on renewable energy, reducing our carbon footprint, fostering diversity and inclusion, and driving 
community development.
In alignment with these goals, SCL has set an ambitious target to achieve Carbon Neutral status 
by FY32. Our strategic emphasis on leveraging technology not only enhances customer and 
operational efficiencies but also minimizes our environmental impact. Our governance practices 
uphold the highest ethical standards, transparency, and accountability, reflecting the expectations 
of an organization of our stature. We have integrated ESG objectives into our management 
performance metrics, intensifying our focus to ensure these initiatives yield tangible results. Our 
primary aim remains to sustain a growth trajectory that aligns with our ESG goals and ensures a 
positive impact.
Additionally, we have implemented comprehensive training programs across all employee levels, 
including our board of directors. Our investment in IT infrastructure supports our commitment 
to minimizing social and environmental impacts. All employees are covered under insurance, 
and we have established robust health and safety policies and grievance mechanisms. We place 
a strong emphasis on stakeholder management and maintain a zero-tolerance policy toward 
human rights and harassment issues, ensuring no non-compliance in these areas. Our efforts 
have led to reductions in energy intensity, water intensity, and emission intensity, complemented 
by our waste recycling initiatives and the installation of solar panels at one of our offices. Our 
investment in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives underscores our commitment to 
community support, and our customer-centric approach remains a top priority as we continue to 
drive sustainable growth.

tangible goods. Its activities focus solely on offering financial solutions to customers, and therefore, we do not maintain 
records for sustainable sourcing.

The primary business function of SCL is to provide mortgage loans. The loan onboarding process is sequential, encompassing 
loan sourcing, processing, disbursement, servicing, and repayment. Below is a summary of each stage:
a) 
Sourcing of Loan:
 
At SCL, loans are sourced through digital channels, branches, and Direct Sale Agents (DSA). Applications are processed via 
our comprehensive digital platform, which offers a seamless home loan experience from application to disbursement. This

Annual Report 2023-24
platform integrates the 4E’s: e-APPLY, e-SANCTION, e-DISBURSE, and e-ENGAGE.
b) 
Loan Processing:
 
• 
Document Submission: The application form, assisted by SCL’s Relationship Manager, is uploaded to the digital portal 
along with various documents. These are then processed by an analytics-driven underwriting engine for a real-time 
preliminary sanction.
 
• 
Credit Underwriting: Submitted documents undergo multiple checks to verify their authenticity and ensure regulatory 
compliance.
 
• 
Legal Appraisal: Property title documents are examined to confirm that the title is clear and marketable.
 
• 
Technical Appraisal: Both an in-house and an external technical team perform dual appraisals of project documents and 
verify the construction stage to determine the appropriate disbursement amount.
c) 
Disbursement:
 
Upon approval, the disbursement process is handled digitally, offering significant convenience to both the Company and its 
customers by reducing paperwork and processing time.
d) 
Servicing:
 
The loan servicing process manages the administrative tasks from the disbursement of proceeds until the loan is fully repaid. 
Customers can request changes to personal information, add or update nominees, or file grievances.
e) 
Repayment Θ Closure:
 
Upon full repayment or prepayment of the loan, the customer receives a mortgage release letter and No Objection Certificate 
(NOC), confirming that all loan dues have been settled. Original or copies of title documents and any other documents 
obtained during the legal process are then returned.
