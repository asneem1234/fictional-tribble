Indicate 
whether risk 
or opportunity 
(R/O
Rationale for

In case of risk, 
approach to
adapt or
mitigate
Financial implications 
of the risk or 
opportunity (Indicate 
positive or negative
implications)
1
GHG Emissions
Risk
With an 
increase in the 
manufacturing 
capacity – to 
keep up with 
the production 
demand, the 
GHG emissions 
will go up.
The Company is 
progressively 
working towards 
use of new and 
improved 
technology 
providing 
efﬁcient system 
to reduce GHG 
Emissions with 
which this risk
can be mitigated.
Negative –
The Company may be 
required to set up 
improved and 
efﬁcient systems and 
processes to reduce 
the GHG Emissions 
which will require a 
new or additional 
setting up of required 
facilities resulting in 
additional capital/ 
revenue expenditure.
2
3
Waste
Management
4
Water
Management
Opportunity
Risk
HAP has a robust 
collection and 
recycling process 
for its plastic 
waste. We also 
convert ETP 
scum to compost 
which is used in 
irrigation land
Water being a 
ﬁnite resource 
will pose a risk 
to the 
operations of 
our business.
HAP has a 
community led 
water 
management and 
conservation 
projects
Rainwater 
harvesting is being 
practiced in our 
manufacturing 
locations
Reduction in raw 
water usage in 
manufacturing 
facilities 
implemented
Positive-
We are taking 
efforts to ensure 
efﬁcient water 
management to 
reduce cost and 
burden on the 
environment.
Energy
Management
Opportunity
Processes and 
Systems are in 
place to ensure 
maximum energy 
efﬁciency and 
this will be 
continuously
improved
HAP sources 
Power from Solar 
panels, Bio gas 
etc., This and 
usage of LEDs 
and natural 
lighting ensures
effective energy 
management and 
mitigate the risk
Positive –
Any cost incurred for 
improving the energy 
management system 
will fetch positive 
outcomes and reduced 
cost in the long run.
5
Employee
Health and
Safety
Risk
This can lead to 
decreased 
productivity
Many efforts and 
initiatives have 
been put in place 
to ensure 
employee health 
and safety. 
Neutral –
Immediate incurring
of expenditure on this 
count will result in 
ﬁnancial outgo. But,
any cost put towards 
employee health and 
safety will yield 
positive results in the 
long term
Better usage of 
our waste 
segregation 
and collection 
processes to 
improve the 
efﬁciency of 
the process
Positive –
The waste generated 
(Scum) is used back 
in our land. Plastic 
recycling reduces 
further costs on 
plastic packaging.
