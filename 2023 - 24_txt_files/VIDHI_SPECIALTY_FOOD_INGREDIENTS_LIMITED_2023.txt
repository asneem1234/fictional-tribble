1
GHG 
Emissions
R
Chemical 
production 
generates greenhouse gas 
(GHG) 
emissions 
through 
fossil 
fuel 
combustion, 
posing risks of regulatory 
fines 
and 
operational 
challenges. Financial impacts 
vary with emission levels 
and 
regulations, 
which 
are tightening as nations 
aim to reduce emissions. 
Companies 
that 
manage 
GHG emissions effectively 
through 
improved 
energy 
efficiency, alternative fuels, 
or 
advanced 
processes 
may benefit from increased 
efficiency, reduced regulatory 
risks, and potential financial 
gains.
Transition 
to 
Renewable 
Energy: 
Vidhi is actively reducing its reliance 
on non-renewable energy sources by 
implementing a 2.5 MW solar power project 
at Sunbless Solar Park, Maharashtra. 
This shift towards renewable energy is 
a key strategy to lower greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions.
Energy Efficiency Enhancements: The 
company is modernizing its operations 
by replacing outdated equipment with 
energy-efficient 
alternatives. 
This 
initiative aims to optimize energy use, 
further reducing the carbon footprint.
Air Quality Monitoring: Vidhi ensures 
compliance with air quality standards by 
conducting regular technical inspections 
to monitor and control emissions. This 
proactive approach helps mitigate risks 
associated with air pollution.
Emission 
Control 
Measures: 
The 
installation of wet scrubbers on HCL, 
Oleum, and H2SO4 tanks is part of Vidhi’s 
commitment 
to 
reducing 
hazardous 
emissions, contributing to a safer and 
cleaner environment.
Wastewater 
Management: 
The 
company has installed two Reverse 
Osmosis (RO) systems at its Dahej facility 
to treat wastewater. This initiative not 
only conserves water but also reduces 
the environmental impact of industrial 
processes.
Focus on Energy Conservation: Vidhi 
prioritizes energy conservation across its 
operations, ensuring that all practices are 
aligned with sustainable and eco-friendly 
goals.

Water and 
Wastewater 
Management
R
Water is crucial for chemical 
production, and rising scarcity 
and costs due to overuse, 
pollution, 
and 
climate 
change highlight the need for 
effective water management. 
Companies 
reliant 
on 
water face higher risks and 
expenses 
from 
shortages 
and wastewater treatment. 
Improving water efficiency 
can reduce operational costs 
and mitigate financial impacts 
from regulations and water-
related issues.
Efficient 
Water 
Recycling: 
Vidhi 
directs 80 KL of process water to a Multi 
Evaporate Plant, where the treated water 
is repurposed for gardening and domestic 
use. This recycling process minimizes 
wastewater discharge and maximizes 
resource utilization.
Comprehensive 
Wastewater 
Treatment: The remaining process water 
undergoes thorough treatment at Vidhi’s 
Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP), which 
includes both primary and secondary 
treatment stages. The treated water is 
then sent to a Common Effluent Treatment 
Plant (CETP) for further processing, 
ensuring compliance with environmental 
standards.
Rainwater Harvesting: Vidhi actively 
harvests rainwater, collecting it for use 
in gardening and various operational 
activities. This initiative not only conserves 
water but also supports the company’s 
broader sustainable water management 
goals.
Negative
3
Waste and 
Hazardous 
Material 
Management
R
Chemical 
production 
generates potentially harmful 
waste, including heavy metals 
and sludge, which involves 
strict regulations for handling, 
transport, 
and 
disposal. 
Effective waste management 
strategies, such as reducing, 
treating, and recycling waste, 
may require initial investment 
but 
can 
lower 
long-term 
costs and reduce risks of 
regulatory fines and cleanup 
responsibilities.
Responsible Waste Management: Vidhi 
adheres to stringent pollution control 
board guidelines for waste management 
and disposal, ensuring environmental 
compliance.
Hazardous 
Waste 
Disposal: 
The 
company 
responsibly 
manages 
hazardous waste, including ETP sludge, 
by collecting and sending it to Mumbai 
Waste Management Limited (MWML) for 
proper treatment and disposal.
Calorific Value Management: Vidhi 
ensures that waste with a calorific value 
below 3000 kcal/kg is appropriately 
handled, adhering to best practices 
for 
waste 
disposal 
and 
minimizing 
environmental impact.

Energy 
Efficiency
R
Chemical 
production 
requires substantial energy 
for 
various 
operations, 
typically from fossil fuels 
or 
purchased 
electricity, 
making 
energy 
costs 
a 
major expense. Companies 
often use a mix of in-house 
power, grid electricity, and 
alternative energy sources, 
considering factors like cost, 
reliability, 
environmental 
impact, and regulatory risks. 
Energy sourcing decisions 
can 
significantly 
affect 
operational efficiency and risk 
management.
Commitment to Renewable Energy: 
Vidhi is dedicated to responsible energy 
use by integrating renewable sources, 
such as solar power, to decrease 
dependence on non-renewable energy.
Carbon 
Footprint 
Reduction: 
The 
company actively works to minimize its 
carbon footprint through sustainable 
practices, aiming to create a positive 
environmental impact.
Energy-Efficient 
Operations: 
Vidhi 
utilizes 
modern, 
energy-efficient 
equipment to reduce pollution, further 
supporting 
its 
sustainability 
goals 
and enhancing overall environmental 
stewardship.

Human Rights
R
Human rights are crucial 
to 
business 
operations, 
encompassing 
the 
fair 
treatment of all stakeholders, 
including 
employees 
and 
local 
communities. 
Companies 
must 
uphold 
ethical standards by ensuring 
fair labour practices, health 
and 
safety, 
respect 
for 
indigenous 
rights, 
and 
minimizing 
environmental 
harm. Adhering to human 
rights not only aligns with 
global ethics but also helps 
avoid reputational damage, 
regulatory 
penalties, 
and 
potential litigation.
Commitment to Human Rights: Vidhi 
is dedicated to upholding and advancing 
human rights standards through well-
established policies and procedures.
Reporting Mechanism: Employees can 
report any violations to the Head of the 
Department, with the option to escalate 
concerns to the CFO if necessary. This 
ensures that all issues are addressed 
promptly and appropriately.
Internal 
Compliance 
Committee: 
Depending on the nature of the issue, 
complaints can also be directed to 
the Internal Compliance Committee, 
providing an additional layer of oversight 
and accountability.
Human Rights Training: The company 
regularly conducts human rights training 
to raise awareness among employees 
and ensure adherence to proper conduct, 
reinforcing Vidhi’s commitment to ethical 
practices.

Community 
Relations
R
Chemical 
companies 
contribute 
economically 
to

through 
job creation, tax revenue, 
and investment but face 
challenges 
related 
to

and 
process 
safety. 
These 
challenges 
can 
lead 
to 
regulatory 
fines, 
legal 
issues, 
and 
reputational 
damage. 
Building 
strong

Governance, leadership and oversight

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related 
challenges, targets and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this 
disclosure)
At Vidhi Speciality, we take pride in leading the industry in superior synthetic and natural food-grade 
colours, while steadfastly committing to sustainability and responsibility. Our first Business Responsibility 
and Sustainability Report highlights our dedication to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) 
principles, emphasizing transparency and accountability.
Over the past year, our commitment to sustainability has advanced significantly. The successful 
implementation of our 2.5 MWp/2MW solar power project at Sunbless Solar Park in Maharashtra has 
made a substantial impact, reducing our reliance on non-renewable energy sources and reinforcing our 
leadership in industry standards. Additionally, we have further enhanced energy efficiency through the 
modernization of our equipment and have improved wastewater management via our ETP plant. Our 
continued efforts in utilizing rainwater for various operations underscore our dedication to responsible 
resource management and environmental stewardship.
Our waste management practices are robust, ensuring that hazardous materials are carefully handled 
and disposed of by certified agencies. The safety and well-being of our stakeholders are paramount, and 
we foster a safe work environment through rigorous training and enhanced safety measures.
We uphold ethical practices with strict internal controls and support local producers to drive shared 
growth. Through our CSR initiatives, we actively enhance community quality of life, demonstrating our 
commitment to sustainable development. We thank all our stakeholders for their support and invite you 
to join us as we continue this journey toward a more sustainable future.
Thank you for your continued support.

The company promotes transparent communication. Employees 
and staff are encouraged to first address their concerns with 
their direct Head of Department (HOD). If the issue remains 
unresolved, they should escalate their grievances via email to 
either the CFO or the factory leader, depending on the context. 
For matters involving sexual harassment or discrimination, 
individuals—whether victims or witnesses—can submit a 
complaint, either named or anonymous, to the Internal Complaint 
Committee (ICC). These complaints are then sent to the relevant 
HOD, who works with the ICC to address and resolve the issue.
To ensure that concerns and grievances are reported accurately, 
the Audit Committee is responsible for implementing a vigilance 
mechanism. The company is dedicated to adhering to the Sexual 
Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition,

10. Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the 
strategy adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products 
and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
The company, a leader in synthetic food colours and specialty chemicals, is deeply committed to ensuring safety 
and environmental responsibility by minimizing the use of hazardous and toxic substances in our products and 
processes. We strictly adhere to all legal standards governing emissions, wastewater, and waste disposal, and 
maintain rigorous monitoring across our manufacturing sites.
Our wastewater management system is designed for efficiency and sustainability. We recycle 80 KL of post-
process water daily using a Multi-Effect Evaporator (MEE) plant, which is then repurposed for gardening and other 
day-to-day activities. The remaining wastewater undergoes treatment at our Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP), and 
the treated water is safely discharged into the Common Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP). Sludge generated from 
this process is responsibly disposed of through government-authorized third-party vendors.
In addition, we implement comprehensive waste management practices that focus on minimizing waste generation, 
segregating waste at its source, and recycling processed wastewater. Hazardous materials are handled with the 
utmost care, and all waste disposal methods are fully compliant with the regulations set forth by the Maharashtra 
Pollution Control Board (MPCB), Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB), and other relevant authorities.
To further enhance workplace safety and environmental stewardship, we have established robust monitoring 
mechanisms and conduct regular compliance checks. Our recycling facilities, equipped with a Multi-Effect 
Evaporator, process 80 KL of wastewater daily, and sludge is meticulously managed by third-party vendors. All 
effluents, emissions, and waste are maintained well within the limits prescribed by the Central Pollution Control 
Board (CPCB) and State Pollution Control Boards (SPCB).
