 Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide 
details.
As part of its initiatives to reduce the GHG emissions, the Company has implemented various energy conservation ideas 
to reduce energy consumption and minimise the carbon footprint.
Following are the significant energy conservation measures taken during the year to reduce GHG emissions:
1. 
Alternative energy source like Solar power to reduce carbon footprint.
2. 
Efficient air compressor replaced with old air compressor and Installation of Variable Frequency Drive 
(VFD) to save power.
3. 
Installed Automatic Tube Cleaning System (ATCS) on Chilling plant to save energy.
4.  
 Modification of jet mill for reduction in batch cycle time.
5.
Chilled water system was installed for optimum usages which used 300 TR instead of 400 TR during winter season.
6. 
Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) and Pressure Transmitter were provided for controlled RPM.
7. 
Chilled water existing open loop converted in closed loop to save energy.
8. 
Staggering usages of Transformer during silent hours to save copper losses of power.
9. 
Optimisation of cooling tower operation for energy saving i.e. One cooling tower for two utilities.
10. Heat recovery wheel of Air Handling.
