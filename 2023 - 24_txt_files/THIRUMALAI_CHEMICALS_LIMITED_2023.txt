26.Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues. Please indicate material responsible business conduct 
and sustainability issues pertaining to environmental and social matters that present a risk or an opportunity to your business, 
rationale for identifying the same, approach to adapt or mitigate the risk along-with its financial implications, as per the following 
format
In FY 22-23 , we carried out an extensive materiality assessment to identify and understand the material topics that directly or 
indirectly impacted our organisation and business operations within the ESG framework. Through this detailed analysis, we were 
able to focus our efforts on the most relevant sustainability issues for our stakeholders and strategic partners, aligning with our 
goals and targets.
Our approach, which prioritised stakeholder input, both external and internal, is seen as a balanced and holistic methodology 
to arrive at the topics most critical to the organisation. We identified key stakeholder groups vital to the entity and conducted 
surveys, incorporating ESG-related criteria. Additionally, we performed peer-benchmarking and analysed various ESG Rating 
agencies and standards within our sector to identify the specific materiality topics of importance to us. External Stakeholders 
included customers, suppliers, investors, and community representatives, while internal stakeholders comprised employees 
across different levels and departments. We designed comprehensive surveys that addressed a range of ESG-related topics 
such as environmental impact, social responsibility, ethical governance, and economic performance. These surveys were tailored 
to gather insights specific to each stakeholder group’s perspectives and expectations. Once the surveys were completed, we 
analysed the data to identify the materiality topics. These findings were then mapped onto a materiality matrix., which visually 
represented the importance and impact of each material topic. This matrix helped us prioritise and categorise issues into high, 
medium, and low priority categories. The ESG materiality topics and matrix was presented by the senior management to the 
Board of Directors, highlighting key ESG issues based on stakeholder input and strategic priorities. Following a detailed review 
and discussion, the Board validated and firmed up the material topics, ensuring they accurately reflect the company’s impact 
and objectives.
The comprehensive materiality assessment proved instrumental in establishing our ESG goals and targets. By identifying 
and prioritising key sustainability issues through this assessment, we were able to set specific and impactful targets that 
directly address the most relevant concerns for our stakeholders and business operations. Overall, integrating surveys and 
76 | Thirumalai Chemicals Limited 
interviews from both external and internal stakeholders allowed us to conduct a robust materiality assessment that informed 
our sustainability strategy and target-setting process effectively. This approach ensured that our ESG initiatives were aligned 
with stakeholder expectations and industry best practices, leading to measurable progress and positive outcomes in our 
sustainability journey.

over 85% of solid wastes being 
transformed 
into 
highly 
pure 
saleable products and valuable by-
products. This approach not only

Carbon
Footprint
R
TCL is committed to combating 
climate change through initiatives 
focused 
on 
enhancing 
energy 
efficiency and increasing the use 
to renewable energy sources to 
lower our carbon footprint. Our 
manufacturing 
processes 
are 
among the most efficient in the 
industry, 
resulting 
in 
significant 
reductions 
in 
specific 
energy 
consumption. Over the last three 
decades, we have achieved an 
impressive 78% decrease in specific 
energy consumption, showcasing 
our commitment to sustainability 
and environmental stewardship.
To achieve a near zero energy 
footprint, we have adopted a three-
pronged approach to energy savings. 
First, we harness energy from waste 
heat, maximising resource utilisation. 
Second, 
we 
prioritise 
energy 
efficiency across our operations, 
ensuring every unit of energy is used 
judiciously. Third, we foster a culture 
of innovation, among our employees, 
encouraging them to propose, and 
implement creative solutions that 
further reduce energy consumption 
and 
contribute 
to 
sustainability 
goals. As a result of this approach 
and mitigation plans we look to 
bring about 25% reduction in GHG 
emissions from the baseline year 
2022-23

5. Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan? Give details in 100 words/ web link.
Yes, the organisation has a disaster recovery plan, which is a comprehensive framework designed to ensure swift and effective 
responses to unforeseen events that could disrupt operations. This plan outlines strategic measures to mitigate risks, restore 
critical functions, and minimise downtime in the event of natural disasters, technological failures, or other emergencies. The 
responsibility for the Business Continuity and Disaster Management plan lies with the Safety Department Head, referencing ISO 
14001:2015, and ISO 45001 Clause 8.2- Emergency Preparedness and Response.
The procedure involves identifying potential emergencies by analyzing all activities and products for their environmental impact. 
It also anticipates emergencies like major fires, flammable liquid releases, explosions, natural disasters, Structural Collapse, 
Uncontrollable leakage of hazardous chemicals, Deluge of untreated effluent or High Pressure Steam Etc. Each one of them or 
a combination of them can be an Emergency Situation
The Business Continuity and Disaster Management Plan applies to all the emergency situations which can occur in any of the 
locations like the Factory premises in SIPCOT, Ranipet, Receiving terminal at Walaja Road Railway Station, Ammoor or Storage 
Installation at Royapuram, Chennai near Chennai Port. The Emergency Preparedness and Response plan are prepared by the 
Safety Head, Terminal Heads, and Productions Heads, approved by Management representatives ,and distributed to relevant 
personnel. Regular testing, including unannounced drills, is conducted for each scenario, with observations documented for 
continual improvement. Plans are regularly reviewed based on insights from mock drills and real emergencies by the Safety Head.
