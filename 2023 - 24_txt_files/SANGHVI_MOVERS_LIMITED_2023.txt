(Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) is the practice of companies disclosing information about their 
environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance. It goes beyond financial reporting to provide stakeholders with a 
comprehensive view of a company’s non-financial impacts and contributions to sustainable development. BRSR covers topics such as 
environmental impact, social responsibility, and governance practices, aiming to promote transparency and accountability.)

Financial 
implications of the 
risk or opportunity 
(Indicate positive 
or negative 
implications)
1.
Emissions &
Pollutants
Risk
As a crane rental company, SML rents cranes for a 
variety of projects. The operation of these cranes 
is an energy-intensive activity that generates 
significant direct and indirect Greenhouse Gas 
(GHG) emissions, including carbon dioxide 
and methane from fuel use. Uncontrolled 
pollutants and emissions during operation and 
associated activities may impose some legal and 
environmental risks for the company.
SML is committed to clean energy transition 
with an environmental policy. We’ve 
invested in solar plants and energy-efficient 
equipment like air conditioning units, 
contributing to renewable energy and 
energy conservation.
Negative
2.
Improve
Operational
Efficiency
Opportunity The goal of operational efficiency is to achieve 
more with less. This can be accomplished by 
using less energy, increasing yield, and optimising 
equipment usage. Implementing processes aimed 
at overall optimisation presents an opportunity for 
companies to enhance profits and achieve long-
term sustainability.
Positive
3.
Waste
Management
Risk
Waste is commonly produced during company 
operations, machinery maintenance, and 
administrative tasks, posing risks to the 
environment, air quality, climate, and ecosystems. 
Improper waste management can endanger 
personnel safety and result in substantial fines for 
non-compliance with regulations.
SML has established Waste Management 
and IT E-Waste Management Policies to 
promote a circular economy. We have 
implemented systems and procedures to 
responsibly dispose of waste in accordance 
with best practices and standards, 
emphasising a sustainable approach.
Negative
4.
Climate Risk 
and Adaption
Risk
Climate change events pose physical risks such as 
floods and wildfires, as well as transitional risks 
such as mandatory renewable energy regulations. 
These events can potentially impact the business. 
Hence, there is a need to assess and mitigate these 
risks.
Our company has not identified any 
climate risks to our business. However, 
we are actively monitoring the evolving 
environmental landscape and associated 
regulations to ensure that we stay informed 
and prepared for any potential climate-
related risks in the future.
Negative
5.
Circular
Economy
Opportunity The Circular Economy model of production and 
consumption promotes the reusing, refurbishing, 
and recycling of existing materials and products. 
The transition to a circular economy will influence 
changes in building design and material usage. 
Shifts in regulations and demand, combined with 
new technology, have the potential to reduce costs.

6.
Customer
Satisfaction
Risk
In a sector with high-value projects, ensuring 
customer satisfaction is essential. An unsatisfactory 
consumer experience may pose a risk to business 
continuity, while a positive customer experience 
can enhance profits and brand reputation.
Ensuring service quality is our utmost 
priority at SML. We have an escalation 
mechanism in place to address customer 
concerns promptly and provide timely 
responses. The company ensures the timely 
delivery of its cranes to customer job sites as 
per contractual commitments and maintains 
a robust monitoring system to ensure 
smooth crane operations at the client’s job 
site. SML has received various Certificates of 
Appreciation from its customers for timely 
project completion and adherence to HSE 
(Health, Safety, and Environment) practices.
Negative
7.
Operational
Health &
Safety
Risk
A significant amount of manual labour is 
required for operations, maintenance, repair 
work, and other on-site tasks. Due to the 
workforce’s exposure to powered haulage and 
heavy machinery, several mishaps, fall accidents, 
fatalities, and injuries may occur. Additionally, 
temporary employees can be at a higher risk due 
to a lack of training or work experience. If workers’ 
health and safety are not protected, there may 
be fines and penalties. Major events can result 
in acute injuries and potential liabilities due to 
legal or regulatory actions. Risks involving health 
and safety can also cause project delays and 
downtime, increasing project costs and decreasing 
profitability.
SML places a strong emphasis on Employee 
Health and Safety (EHS) and strives 
to maintain the highest standards of 
Occupational Health and Safety (OHS). As 
an ISO 45001 certified company, we have 
a dedicated EHS team that proactively 
addresses safety measures at both our 
offices and sites. The team conducts regular 
trainings for employees and workers to 
ensure their well-being. We also organise 
initiatives such as Safety Week and safety 
workshops throughout the year to promote 
a culture of safety and enhance awareness 
of best practices. The company rigorously 
follows all due and necessary SOPs to ensure 
maximum operational health and safety for 
its employees and cranes at job sites.
Negative
8.
Employee
Well-being &
Retention
Risk
Higher employee retention rates reflect good 
company policies and practices. Conversely, a high 
attrition rate indicates low employee satisfaction, 
which can concern investors. Ensuring employee 
well-being can boost morale and reduce hiring and 
onboarding costs.
SML prioritises the overall growth of 
its employees through robust people 
practices. We emphasise health and well-
being initiatives, fair pay norms, equal 
opportunities, and extensive training 
programmes. Performance appraisals and 
promotions are designed to encourage 
employee retention. Additionally, we 
organise various events such as annual 
sports events, festival celebrations, 
trekking, health check-ups, and learning 
and development programmes to foster a 
positive and engaging work environment.

9.
Labour 
Management
Risk
Businesses requiring workers on-site must 
ensure effective labour management practices. 
This includes managing the complexity of their 
workforce (size, labour intensity, and operational 
locations), improving management-labour 
interaction, ensuring worker rights effectiveness, 
and engaging workers. Attrition of skilled labour, 
especially, poses operational risks for companies.
The company implements robust labour 
management systems, including clear 
job descriptions and regular training 
programmes. We foster a positive work 
culture, prioritise employee well-being, and 
maintain open lines of communication to 
address concerns promptly.
Negative
10.
Diversity &
Inclusion
Opportunity A company’s high diversity and inclusion rate 
reflects employees’ sense of belonging and 
fairness within the company. Improving diversity 
and inclusion helps companies support vulnerable 
groups, thereby enhancing the community brand 
image of the company.
The company will formulate measures to 
improve diversity and inclusion.
Positive
11.
Human
Rights
Risk
Companies focusing on respecting human rights 
demonstrate their commitment to building 
sustainable and mutually beneficial relationships 
with those influenced or impacted by their 
operations, including customers, communities, 
workers, and investors. This includes demonstrating 
care for the people whose lives they engage with.
At SML, human dignity is a fundamental 
core value. We prioritise equal opportunity, 
strictly enforce policies against sexual 
harassment, prohibit child and forced 
labour, and adhere to a comprehensive 
code of conduct. By upholding these 
principles, we ensure the highest level of 
compliance with human rights standards 
throughout our operations.
Negative
12.
Customer
Information
And Privacy
Protection
Risk
Companies are assessed based on the amount 
of personal data they collect, their exposure to 
evolving or increasing privacy regulations, their 
vulnerability to potential data breaches, and the 
effectiveness of their data protection systems.
SML respects and protects the data privacy 
of its customers. We have a privacy policy 
and robust systems in place to safeguard 
customer information and protect customer 
data.
Negative
13.
Corporate
Governance
Risk
Businesses are assessed based on their 
performance across all key governance issues, 
which include ownership and control, board pay, 
accounting practices, business ethics, and tax 
transparency. This topic examines the effect that 
a company’s corporate governance and business 
ethics practices have on its shareholders and 
other investors.
SML is committed to strict adherence 
to all relevant laws and regulations, 
with robust systems in place to monitor 
regulatory compliance. We conduct our 
business ethically, transparently, and with 
accountability, striking a balance between 
the interests of our shareholders and 
stakeholders. Our senior management 
conducts regular reviews to ensure 
compliance and uphold these principles.
Negative
14.
Business
Ethics And
Compliance
Risk
Key issues relevant to business ethics include 
fraud, executive misconduct, corrupt practices, 
money laundering, and anti-trust violations. Ethics 
violations can lead to police investigations, hefty 
fines, settlement costs, and damage to reputation.
SML has implemented an Anti-Bribery and 
Anti-Corruption Policy along with a robust 
Vigil Mechanism and Whistleblower policy. 
The management consistently monitors 
the effectiveness of these measures to 
ensure a strong stance against bribery and 
corruption.

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases.
 
 SML prioritises a discrimination and harassment-free workplace. Our comprehensive POSH policy outlines clear procedures for 
reporting sexual harassment, with a zero-tolerance stance. Employees of all genders and sexualities are empowered to report 
concerns without fear of retaliation.
 
 An Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) ensures fair investigations, protecting both complainant and accused. Confidentiality is 
a priority, and we provide support and measures to prevent repercussions for the complainant. Based on the investigation, the 
ICC recommends appropriate disciplinary action and necessary reparations for any harm caused.
 
 Through this framework, SML fosters a safe and supportive environment where employees feel empowered to speak up. We aim 
to prevent discrimination and harassment, building a respectful and inclusive work culture for all.
