Established in 1972 by brothers Mr. S. K. Saraf and Mr. S. M. Saraf, both graduates and technologists from 
IIT Powai, Technocraft initially concentrated on the domestic market. The company embarked on a 
significant export initiative in the year 1977 and this bold move paid off when Technocraft was designated 
as an export house by the Government of India in 1979. 
 
Specializing in the manufacturing of high precision and sophisticated Drum 
Closure Products, Technocraft successfully penetrated export markets in the 
Middle East, USA and Europe. To facilitate its international trade, the Company 
established multiple foreign subsidiaries for efficient stock mobilization. 
 
By 1994, Technocraft had solidified its position as one of the largest and most 
reputed suppliers of Drum Closures worldwide. Expanding its portfolio, the 
Company acquired Maharashtra Steel Tubes Ltd. in the same year, adding steel 
pipe manufacturing to its capabilities. 
 
A significant turning point came in 1994 with the establishment of an office in the United Kingdom (UK), 
marking a pivotal moment in Technocraft's expansion strategy, particularly in the European market. 
 
In 1997, Technocraft diversified its operations by venturing into the 
manufacturing of Cotton Yarn, which was granted a 100% Export Oriented Unit 
(EOU) status. The Cotton Yarn Division specializes in the production and export 
of high-quality 100% Cotton Ring Spun Yarn, ranging from NE 20 to NE 40. 
Equipped with state-of-the-art Swiss, Japanese and other machinery, the 
spinning mill employs highly skilled technical experts. Additionally, the 
division operates a 15 MW Captive Power Generation Plant to meet its energy 
requirements. 
 
As a group, Technocraft has been a prominent player in the precision engineering sector. It further 
expanded its Tube Division by producing high-precision scaffolding systems for building construction. 
Moreover, the Cotton Yarn Division expanded its operations by manufacturing and exporting garments 
through its subsidiary. 
 
Continuously striving to meet the evolving demands of its customers, Technocraft focuses on growth 
through constant innovation, diversification into new categories and maintaining a strong presence in both 
domestic and international markets.

We successfully manufacture and supply high-quality steel tubes with 
excellent dimensional accuracy and surface quality. Our Technocraft 
Scaffolding System has been designed with a focus on ease of erection, 
health, and safety regulations, ensuring no loose fittings or hardware are 
present. 
We produce a variety of products, ranging from NE 20 to NE 40, 
including carded and combed varieties of cotton yarn. The yarn, in 
its raw-white state and spun using ring spinning techniques, is 
utilized for both knitting and weaving applications. 
We, through Technosoft Engineering (TE), have been providing 
engineering design services to various engineering/ manufacturing 
companies since our establishment in 1999. Our offerings encompass 
multi-disciplinary engineering services in sectors such as 
engineering, consulting, innovation, resources, content, automotive, 
mining equipment, general machinery and structural engineering. 
We are the second largest global manufacturer of steel drum 
closures, which encompass Tite Seal flanges and plugs, Tite Seal 
gaskets, Tite Seal Leak Locks plugs, octagon base drum flanges and 
auto closure systems.

Energy 
Management 
Risk
Energy plays a pivotal role in 
the manufacturing of industrial 
machinery. 
The 
predominant 
portion of energy expenditure 
in this sector is attributed to 
purchased 
electricity, 
followed 
by purchased fuels. The specific 
energy 
sources 
utilized, 
their 
consumption 
levels 
and 
the 
employed energy management 
approaches vary depending on 
the nature of the manufactured 
products. A company’s energy 
composition, encompassing on-
site generated electricity, grid-
supplied electricity and alternative 
energy sources, can significantly 
impact both the cost and reliability 
of energy provision. Consequently, 
these factors ultimately influence 
the entity’s cost framework and 
regulatory exposure.
The Company aims to optimize 
its energy sources, incorporating 
on-site electricity generation and 
alternative energy sources. This 
effort significantly influences the 
cost and reliability of energy supply, 
ultimately shaping the company’s 
cost 
framework, 
environmental 
footprint and regulatory risk.

Employee 
Health & 
Safety
Risk 
Employees 
within 
industrial 
machinery 
manufacturing 
plants 
encounter various health and safety 
hazards, such as exposure to heavy 
machinery, 
moving 
equipment 
and electrical risks. Establishing a 
robust safety culture is imperative to 
proactively mitigate potential safety 
incidents. This proactive approach 
can lead to decreased healthcare 
expenses, litigation and disruptions 
to work operations. 
The Company endeavors to 
reduce health and safety risks 
by enforcing rigorous safety 
measures, 
which 
include 
incident reporting, thorough 
investigation and fostering 
a safety-oriented culture. By 
doing so, Technocraft strives 
to 
diminish 
safety-related 
costs and potentially enhance 
long-term productivity.

Fuel Economy 
& Emissions in 
Use-phase
Risk
Numerous 
products 
within 
the 
Industrial 
Machinery 
& 
Goods 
sector rely on fossil fuels and emit 
greenhouse gases (GHGs) and 
other air pollutants during operation. 
Rising consumer preferences for 
enhanced fuel efficiency, coupled 
with regulatory measures limiting 
emissions, are driving a growing 
demand for energy-efficient and 
lower-emission products within the 
industry.
Technocraft is evaluating and 
shall strive to explore options 
for 
usage 
of 
renewable 
energy in the long run in order 
to reduce reliance on fossil 
fuels – to have a positive 
impact on environment & 
financials.

Materials 
Sourcing 
Risk
Industrial 
machinery 
companies 
face supply chain vulnerabilities 
when relying on crucial materials for 
their products. These entities often 
manufacture goods utilizing critical 
materials that have limited or no 
viable substitutes, many of which are 
obtained from a handful of countries, 
exposing 
them 
to 
geopolitical 
uncertainties. Furthermore, these 
companies encounter competition 
due to rising global demand for such 
materials across various sectors, 
leading to potential price hikes and 
supply instabilities.
The 
Company 
aims 
to 
minimize reliance on critical 
materials 
by 
exploring 
alternative 
options 
and 
ensuring a secure supply 
chain. This approach would 
help mitigate the risk of 
financial 
repercussions 
resulting 
from 
supply 
disruptions and fluctuations 
in input prices.

Water 
management
Opportunity
Industrial 
machinery 
and 
textile 
production are highly water-intensive, 
and improper water management 
can disrupt operations and damage 
reputations. 
The 
Company 
has 
effectively implemented Zero Liquid 
Discharge (ZLD) strategies across 
sectors such as Drum, Textile, and 
Pipe, emphasizing its commitment 
to sustainability and environmental 
stewardship. 
Additionally, 
the 
Company has deployed advanced 
treatment technologies, including 
RO-1, RO-2, RO-3, Nano, STP, ETP, 
and MEE Plant. These installations 
represent 
a 
thorough 
approach 
to 
wastewater 
management, 
demonstrating 
the 
Company’s 
proactive 
stance 
on 
resource 
conservation and pollution control. 
This not only mitigates operational 
risks 
but 
also 
enhances 
the 
Company’s reputation as a leader in 
sustainable industrial practices.

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related 
challenges, targets and achievements
The ongoing shift towards more sustainable lifestyles is reshaping trends across all industries, including ours. 
Today, the wide array of products incorporating innovation necessitates producers to continually enhance quality 
and offer items with reduced carbon footprints. Alongside monetary considerations, the non-monetary aspects 
of sustainability are crucial for comprehensive business growth. This underscores the importance of formally 
recognizing and adhering to best practices in the realms of Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG).
In the coming years, the company aims to intensify its sustainability initiatives by minimizing emissions, 
optimizing resource usage, streamlining processes, prioritizing energy efficiency, and adopting a multifaceted 
digital approach, thereby enhancing its existing practices.

Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its coverage 
and implementation. 
	
Indeed, Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) strategies have been effectively implemented across various divisions 
including Drum, Textile, and Pipe. This initiative underscores the company’s commitment to sustainable practices 
and environmental stewardship.
Moreover, the company has strategically deployed a range of cutting-edge treatment technologies including 
RO-1, RO-2, RO-3, Nano, STP, ETP, and MEE Plant. These installations represent a comprehensive approach 
to wastewater management, reflecting the organization’s proactive stance towards resource conservation and 
pollution mitigation.
In particular, our provision of a comprehensive Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) for the treatment of industrial 
effluents encompasses primary, secondary, and tertiary treatment processes, augmented by ultra-filtration and 
a sophisticated 4-stage Reverse Osmosis (RO) system. The utilization of Reverse Osmosis permeate for utility 
purposes marks a pivotal achievement in realizing ZLD objectives within the industry. Notably, RO rejects undergo 
further treatment through Advanced Thermal Fluidized Bed Dryer (ATFD) and Mechanical Vapor Recompression 
(MVR) Evaporator (MEE) plants, ensuring minimal waste and maximizing resource recovery.
Additionally, our implementation of Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) for domestic effluent treatment demonstrates 
a holistic approach to water management. The treated water from these plants finds purposeful reuse in land 
irrigation, contributing to sustainable landscaping practices and reducing reliance on freshwater resources.
In Pipe division, everyday, we successfully recycle a substantial amount of wastewater: 60,000 liters via the Effluent 
Treatment Plant (ETP), 50,000 liters through the Sewage Treatment Plant (STP), and 10,000 liters in the Multiple 
Effect Evaporation (MEE) Plant. These comprehensive recycling processes enable our factory to function as a Zero 
Liquid Discharge (ZLD) facility.
The reclaimed water is efficiently utilized within our manufacturing processes and for irrigation of our gardens. This 
practice highlights our commitment to environmental stewardship and resource conservation, ensuring that no 
treated water goes to waste.
	
In summary, the integration of advanced treatment technologies and holistic wastewater management strategies 
exemplify the company’s proactive efforts towards achieving environmental sustainability and regulatory compliance 
across its operations.

Industrial effluent treatment
The Company has been actively 
collaborating with a professor from 
the Indian Institute of Technology 
(IIT) 
who 
has 
developed 
Nanocarbon Florets for Industrial 
Effluent Treatment. Nanomaterials 
are transforming various sectors 
including medicine, electronics, 
and 
biocompatible 
materials. 
Scientists are exploring different 
forms 
of 
nano 
carbon 
such 
as 
nanotubes, 
nanocones, 
nanohorns, graphene, and carbon 
onions. 
Recently, 
researchers 
from IIT Bombay introduced a 
novel form known as nano carbon 
florets, 
resembling 
marigold 
flowers. Beyond their aesthetic 
appeal, these nano-sized florets 
offer 
significant 
environmental 
benefits by effectively removing 
harmful heavy metal pollutants 
from industrial effluents.
In a recent publication featured in the 
esteemed journal ACS Applied Nano 
Materials, Professor C. Subramaniam 
and his research team from the 
Department of Chemistry have unveiled 
ground 
breaking 
advancements 
in 
nanotechnology. Their innovative design 
of nanocarbon florets demonstrates 
remarkable 
efficacy 
in 
eliminating 
pollutants, including arsenic, chromium, 
cadmium, and mercury, from industrial 
effluents. Through rigorous testing, it has 
been revealed that these nanocarbon 
florets have the capacity to remove 
up to 90% of such contaminants from 
the installed Effluent Treatment Plant 
(ETP). This significant achievement 
underscores the transformative potential 
of 
nanotechnology 
in 
addressing 
environmental challenges and enhancing 
wastewater treatment processes.
