Energy & 
Climate 
Change
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Trident is dependent on fossil fuels 
as a source of energy for boilers. The 
Company is also dependent on heavy 
amount of water intake for paper and pulp 
manufacturing. Any disruption in the supply 
chain of traditional fuel will have direct and 
significant increase in the price and could 
adversely affect the Company’s operations 
and profitability. Secondly, as climate change 
is leading to more intense weather events 
such as- heat waves, droughts, extreme 
floods and cyclones, it can impact the water 
availability at extreme high temperatures, 
forest degradation, and also impact the 
supply chain during extreme weather events. 
These events can have direct impact on the 
Company’s value chain operations and could 
lead to a declining revenue.
Opportunity: The Company can adapt to 
innovate processes to achieve energy 
efficiency and reduce carbon footprint 
throughout the value chain. The 
Company can explore decarbonization 
opportunities throughout the value chain 
and develop products which has low/zero 
emissions. Climate change adaptation and 
decarbonization solutions will also provide the 
company an opportunity to gain competitive 
edge and enhance market position
The Company has implemented ESG 
principles across the business functions 
and operations and have undertaken 
some key targets under the pillars 
of Energy, Nature, Waste, Packaging, 
Transportation, Product use and 
Enterprise. Trident has undertaken 
Science Based Targets to reduce 
Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 
2031 and become a Net-Zero Company 
2040. Some of the best practices 
implemented includes- replacing 
coal with biomass fuel, electricity 
transition from coal-based grid supply 
to renewable purchases and PPAs, 
water conservation and recycling and 
CAPEX investment in energy efficient 
equipment. 
Positive Implication: 
Implementation of 
measures to switch 
from Coal will reduce 
carbon emissions 
and enhance 
the Company’s 
reputation in the 
long run resulting in 
resulting in better 
brand value.
Costly Investments: 
Adapting to 
changing climate 
conditions may 
require significant 
investments in new 
infrastructure or 
equipment.

Health and 
Safety
Risk
As a manufacturing Company, the 
operation at Trident requires workforce to 
interact with plant machinery and handle 
material. These activities may lead to 
accidents, injuries, and fatalities, resulting 
in legal liabilities, fines, compensation 
claims, increased insurance premiums, 
productivity loss and damage to the 
Company’s image. Poor H&S practices 
also contribute to employee dissatisfaction 
and low morale. 
Some of the common health and safety 
risks the Company needs to address are- 
Occupational Hazards, Chemical Hazards, 
Fire and Electrical Hazards, Mechanical 
and Equipment Hazard, and Climate 
Related Hazards (extreme heat and health 
related). 
The Company places strong emphasis on 
health and safety within its operations, 
corporate spaces and supply chain. Various 
measures are implemented to promote 
a safe and healthy working environment, 
such as- Strict adherence to Regulations, 
Periodic Risk Assessment through 
HIRA, Employee and Worker Training on 
occupational health and safety practices 
and procedures, including the proper use 
of personal protective equipment (PPE) 
and emergency response protocols, Safety 
Equipment and Infrastructure, Ongoing 
Safety Audits and continuous employee and 
worker engagements. All manufacturing 
locations are certified to Occupational 
Health and Safety Management Systems 
(ISO 45001:2018) which encourages 
proactive approach to identify, evaluate
and remediate risks before they cause 
accidents and injuries.
By implementing these measures, Trident 
aims to create a safety culture, protect 
employees and ensure compliance 
throughout operations.
Positive: Safe 
workplace aids in 
minimising accidents 
and illnesses, which
have positive impact 
on claims, insurance 
and employee 
productivity

responsibly recycled at our collection centres, while hazardous waste like ETP Sludge is disposed of at authorized Treatment, 
Storage, and Disposal (TSD) Facilities.
 
Our innovations include converting food and biomass waste into electricity via biogas plants and promoting sustainable paper 
packaging through our "Good Paper" campaign. We prioritize Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified papers, reducing carbon 
and water footprints compared to plastics. Trident remains dedicated to minimizing our environmental impact and promoting 
responsible resource management, showcasing our commitment to sustainability and environmental stewardship.

Corporate Overview

10. Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your 
Company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to 
manage such wastes.
 
The Company has established dedicated processes and facilities for handling hazardous waste, battery waste, e-waste, and 
scrap ensuring compliance with all legal requirements associated with different types of waste. Having adopted 5Rs framework 
to address waste generation, viz. Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Re-engineer, Redesign, our primary focus is on waste reduction and 
reuse, and we responsibly dispose of whatever remains.
 
1. 
Waste identification, segregation and storage- We have identified the different types and categories of waste and the 
operations, processes, and activities where they are generated. Areas are earmarked within each department/ process 
where the waste generated daily is segregated and stored. Vendors for recycling different types of waste are identified and 
based on their compliance with legal requirements and the company’s SOP, authorization is granted. The transportation of 
waste follows specific procedures and adherence to the requirements for suitable vehicles and transport methods
 
2. 
Waste reduction, recycle and reuse- While we follow the standard SOP for waste disposal, we give precedence to identifying 
areas within our operations where waste can be reduced. This involves kaizens around optimizing processes, finding 
alternatives to wasteful methods and practices, eg. we have implemented optimization systems to reduce steam and power 
consumption. We also actively explore opportunities to reuse materials within our operations, eg. Comber Noil and rich 
flat cotton waste from spinning units are reused in open end spinning with in our operations. Furthermore, to reduce 
dependency on traditional fuels, we are exploring various forms of waste to energy viz. micro dust from spinning is used in 
boiler, wastewater from washing straw which is rich in organic content is used to generate Biogas.
 
3. 
Responsible Disposal- Disposal of Hazardous waste, Biomedical waste, e-waste, and battery waste is done following all 
necessary compliances and guidelines. Hazardous waste and biomedical waste are handed over to TSDFs (Treatment, 
Storage, and Disposal Facilities) authorized by the State Pollution Control Board, and e-waste and battery waste are given 
to vendors authorized by the State Pollution Control Board.
 
4. 
Chemical Management- The company has a well-documented chemical management policy accessible to all stakeholders 
and supporting procedures on identification, procurement, storage and handling, transportation and traceability of 
chemicals which includes the following procedures: 
 
 
a. 
Chemical Evaluation against requirements of RSL/MRSL prescribed in ZDHC and Oeko Tex STeP and furnishing 
documents viz. TDS, SDS, Certificate of Analysis, GOTS, REACH
 
 
b. 
The Chemical management system holds chemical manager responsible for performing chemical risk assessment 
when incorporating any new chemical
 
 
c. 
Wastewater standard- Ensuring effluent quality meet applicable standards for key parameters such as pH, suspended 
solids, BOD, COD, TDS, Heavy metals and toxic substances.
 
 
 
Daily testing of the ETP in-let water, ETP out-let water is conducted by in-house laboratory. A government-approved 
third-party agency performs monthly testing, and globally recognized laboratories like Hohenstein conduct annual 
tests based on the ZDHC wastewater guidelines.
11. If the entity has operations/offices in/around ecologically sensitive areas (such as national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, 
biosphere reserves, wetlands, biodiversity hotspots, forests, coastal regulation zones etc.) where environmental approvals /
