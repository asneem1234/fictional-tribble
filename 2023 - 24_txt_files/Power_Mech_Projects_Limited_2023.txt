Energy 
Man-
age-
ment
Risk
Energy management emerges as 
a critical material issue for Power 
Mech Projects Limited, a key player 
in infrastructure construction within 
the power sector. Given their spe-
cialization in power generation and 
infrastructure development, the 
company's operations inherently 
involve significant energy consump-
tion. In this context, effective en-
ergy management is essential to en-
sure operational efficiency, minimize 
environmental impact, and control 
costs. Inadequate energy manage-
ment practices pose various risks, 
including operational inefficiency, 
environmental degradation, and 
cost escalation. 
To mitigate energy management 
risks, Power Mech can adopt a 
multifaceted approach. Investing 
in energy-efficient technologies 
and upgrading machinery reduc-
es consumption per output unit. 
Implementing Energy Manage-
ment Systems (EMS) enables re-
al-time monitoring and optimiza-
tion, minimizing waste. Employee 
training reinforces energy-saving 
practices and fosters sustainabil-
ity. Moreover, integrating renew-
able energy sources like solar 
and wind diversifies the energy 
portfolio, reducing reliance on 
fossil fuels and mitigating envi-
ronmental impact. 
Negative
2.
Wa-
ter & 
Waste 
Man-
age-
ment
Risk
The material issue of Water & 
Waste Management emerges as a 
significant concern for Power Mech 
Projects Limited, operating within 
the infrastructure construction 
sector, particularly in power genera-
tion. This issue carries inherent risks 
due to the nature of Power Mech's 
operations, which involve exten-
sive use of water for construction 
activities and power generation 
processes. Additionally, the gen-
eration of waste materials, such as 
construction debris and hazardous 
waste from power plant operations, 
poses environmental and regulatory 
challenges. Inadequate manage-
ment of water resources and waste 
materials can lead to various risks, 
including water scarcity, pollution, 
regulatory non-compliance, and 
reputational damage.
To address the identified risks 
associated with Water & Waste 
Management, Power Mech can 
implement several strategies. 
Firstly, adopting water conser-
vation measures and efficient 
waste management practices 
can help minimize the company's 
environmental footprint and 
reduce regulatory compliance 
risks. This may include recycling 
and reusing water in construc-
tion activities, implementing 
wastewater treatment systems, 
and segregating and properly 
disposing of waste materials. 
Moreover, investing in tech-
nologies and infrastructure for 
sustainable water and waste 
management can enhance oper-
ational efficiency and resilience 
to regulatory changes.

Waste 
& Haz-

Man-
age-
ment
Risk
Given the nature of Power Mech's 
operations, which involve extensive 
construction activities and power 
generation processes, the genera-
tion and handling of waste materi-
als, including hazardous substances, 
pose various environmental, regu-
latory, and reputational risks. Im-
proper management of waste and 
hazardous materials can lead to pol-
lution of air, soil, and water, as well 
as health and safety hazards for 
workers and surrounding communi-
ties. Furthermore, non-compliance 
with waste management regulations 
can result in legal penalties, fines, 
and damage to the company's repu-
tation.
To mitigate the identified risks 
associated with Waste & Haz-
ardous Materials Management, 
Power Mech can adopt sev-
eral proactive measures. Firstly, 
implementing stringent waste 
management protocols and haz-
ardous materials handling proce-
dures is essential to minimize en-
vironmental impact and ensure 
compliance with regulations. 
This may involve proper segre-
gation, storage, transportation, 
and disposal of waste materials, 
as well as the use of appropriate 
personal protective equipment 
(PPE) for workers handling haz-
ardous substances. Additionally, 
investing in technologies and in-
frastructure for waste treatment, 
recycling, and pollution control 
can help mitigate environmen-
tal risks and reduce reliance on 
landfill disposal.

Product 
Qual-

Safety
Opportu-
nity 
The rationale for identifying Prod-
uct Quality & Safety as an opportu-
nity lies in the potential to differen-
tiate Power Mech's offerings from 
competitors and attract clients who 
prioritize quality and safety in their 
projects. By consistently delivering 
products and services that meet or 
exceed industry standards and reg-
ulatory requirements, Power Mech 
can enhance customer loyalty and 
secure repeat business. Moreover, a 
strong focus on product quality and 
safety can help mitigate risks as-
sociated with construction defects, 
accidents, and liabilities, thereby re-
ducing the likelihood of costly legal 
disputes and reputational damage.

Em-

Health 
& Safe-
ty
Risk
The rationale for identifying this 
issue stems from the inherent risks 
associated with construction activi-
ties, which can pose threats to the 
health and safety of employees 
if not properly managed. On one 
hand, inadequate attention to em-
ployee health and safety can result 
in accidents, injuries, and occupa-
tional health hazards, leading to 
human suffering, legal liabilities, and 
reputational damage. Conversely, 
prioritizing employee health and 
safety presents an opportunity 
for Power Mech to create a safe 
and conducive work environment, 
enhance employee morale and 
productivity, and foster a positive 
corporate culture.
In terms of risk mitigation, Power 
Mech can adopt a comprehen-
sive approach to safeguarding 
employee health and safety. This 
may include implementing ro-
bust safety protocols, providing 
regular training and awareness 
programs on hazard identifica-
tion and prevention, conducting 
thorough risk assessments for 
construction sites and power 
plants, and ensuring compli-
ance with relevant occupational 
health and safety regulations. 
Additionally, investing in appro-
priate personal protective equip-
ment (PPE), emergency response 
plans, and health monitoring sys-
tems can help mitigate risks and 
prevent accidents or incidents 
from occurring.

Statement 
by director

responsibility 
report, 
highlighting ESG 
related challenges, 
targets and 
achievements 
As Power Mech is involved in the construction of power plants and infrastructure 
sector, the environmental issues were given a priority thought amongst the 
stakeholders. Being one the pioneers in construction field in both power and non-
power sectors, the company owned its responsibility to align with the need of global 
expectations. The company is committed towards environment and all its site offices 
will ensure that scores of saplings are planted in their vicinity and today most of the 
areas are found to be greener than ever before. As a matter of policy, the company is 
ensuring near-total avoidance of plastic materials at sites. It is aggressively pursuing 
a policy of limiting wastages and clearing off wastages to safe disposal as soon 
as possible. Scraps are collected and sent for recycling and plastic wastages are 
disposed-off with protection.
