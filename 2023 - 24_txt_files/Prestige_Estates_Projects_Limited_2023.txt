Financial 
implications 
of the risk or 
opportunity 
(Indicate 
positive or 
negative 
implications)
1
GHG Emissions
Risk
Construction 
is 
an 
energy-
intensive activity that generates 
significant direct and indirect 
GHG emissions, including CO2 
and methane from fuel use. 
Uncontrolled 
pollutants 
and 
emissions 
during 
operations 
impose legal and environmental 
risks for the Company.
To minimise emissions caused 
by transportation, our entity 
actively 
encourages 
local 
sourcing for raw materials. We 
also prioritise converting DC to 
AC for faucet and flush valves, 
improving 
energy 
efficiency. 
We use Portland Pozzolana 
Cement (PPC) in all non-
structural activities, reducing 
the carbon footprint associated 
with construction projects.
Negative
2
Energy 
Management
Opportunity
Developing 
and 
managing 
real estate requires significant 
reliance on natural resources, 
including timber, water, and 
electricity. 
Managing 
energy 
consumption 
becomes 
essential.
Positive
3
Sustainable 
Construction 
and 
Procurement
Opportunity
Companies are evaluated based 
on the resource consumption 
and carbon intensity of their real 
estate assets, their vulnerability 
to environmental construction 
regulations, and their efforts 
to improve the environmental 
performance of their real estate 
assets.
Positive
4
Climate Change
Risk
Climate change impacts almost 
all geographies and industries, 
posing 
physical 
risks 
like 
floods and wildfires, as well as 
transitional risks like mandatory 
renewable 
energy 
use 
and 
regulatory changes.
The Company combats climate 
change by adopting sustainable 
practices in design, technology, 
and 
safety 
systems, 
and 
implementing renewable energy 
sources like solar panels.

5
Water 
Management
Risk
Water is a crucial resource 
needed 
during 
construction, 
operation, 
and 
maintenance. 
Water 
usage 
impacts 
the 
quality 
and 
quantity 
of 
local 
water 
resources, 
and 
improper discharge can lead to 
contamination and legal risks for 
the Company.
We 
implement 
sewage 
treatment plants (STPs) to 
recycle water for landscaping, 
toilet 
flushes, 
and 
dust 
suppression. In new projects, 
we aim to install smart water 
meters and use low-flow taps 
and aerators to conserve water.
Negative
6
Waste 
Management
Risk
The Circular Economy model 
promotes reusing, refurbishing, 
and recycling materials and 
products. 
Transitioning 
to 
a 
circular 
economy 
affects 
building design and material 
usage. Changes in regulations, 
demand, and new technology 
can reduce costs.
We ensure proper disposal 
of waste through authorised 
vendors 
and 
implement 
buyback 
programs 
for 
batteries. Waste is segregated 
and managed at a centralised 
facility. We prioritise processing 
and recycling waste, promoting 
a sustainable approach.
Negative
7
Employee 
Well-being and 
Development
Risk
High 
employee 
retention 
reflects good Company policies 
and 
practices, 
leading 
to 
higher employee satisfaction. 
High 
attrition 
indicates 
low 
satisfaction, 
increasing 
the 
cost of replacing and training 
employees, 
and 
potentially 
impacting business in critical 
roles.
We are a certified “Great Place 
to 
Work” 
entity, 
focussing 
on reskilling and upskilling 
employees 
in 
emerging

We completed 300 projects, delivering 25 million sq. ft. of area in FY24. Key milestones include strategic partnerships, 
such as our Rs. 2,001 crore deal with ADIA Kotak AIF, and the acquisition of 62.5 acres in NCR with a development potential 
of 10 million sq. ft.

Yes, Prestige Group has a comprehensive anti-bribery policy embedded within its broader anti-fraud and vigilance 
framework. This policy applies to all employees, intermediaries, and entities engaged in contractual relationships with 
Prestige Group. It strictly prohibits anyone representing the Company from making or authorising any payment, either 
directly or indirectly, to a government official (including employees of government-owned companies) with the intent to

intermediary screening in line with our procurement policy, and staff background checks per our HR policy.
2)	
Administrative and Internal Controls: Our administrative and internal controls, such as segregation of duties and a 
transparent procurement process, are fundamental in preventing and detecting fraud.
3)	
Physical and User Access Control: Access controls to premises and IT systems are enforced as per our policies to 
minimise the risk of internal and external fraud.
4)	
Fraud Alerts: The Anti-Fraud and Vigilance Officer develops fraud alerts in collaboration with business departments 
to recognise and address fraudulent attempts promptly.
5)	
Lessons Learnt: Post-investigation, “lessons learnt” documents are created and circulated to all staff to increase 
fraud awareness and identification.
6)	
Fraud Deterrence: We implement deterrent activities to dissuade potential fraudsters by emphasising the likelihood 
of detection and consequences.

projects. This practice is essential for promoting sustainability, reducing costs, and lessening the environmental impact of 
construction activities.
	
Effective waste management in the construction industry is vital to mitigating the harmful effects of construction on 
the environment. Construction waste includes hazardous, non-hazardous, and inert waste, each requiring specific 
management strategies.
	
As a leading construction company, we implement sustainable waste management strategies such as minimizing waste 
generation, recycling, reusing materials, and proper disposal. We continuously strive to increase efficiency on construction 
sites by training workers in waste management. By adopting these practices, we aim to contribute to a cleaner and more 
sustainable future for generations to come.
	
Understanding the different types of construction and demolition waste disposal is crucial for implementing effective 
waste management practices during construction.
BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITY & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT (Contd.)
PLANNING
REUSE & RECYCLING
Following 
the 
start 
of 
construction 
work, 
the 
waste must be segregated 
into 
various 
categories 
such as wood, concrete, 
metal, plastics and so on. 
This makes it easier to 
dispose of the construction 
waste in an eco-friendly 
way.
The third step is to identify 
materials 
that 
can 
be 
reused or recycled. For 
example, wood can be 
burned as fuel or turned 
into 
landscaping 
wood 
chips and concrete can 
be crushed and utilized 
as a base material for 
roadways.
The final step involves 
proper disposal, if reuse or 
recycling is not feasible. This 
involves safely transporting 
waste to designated landfill 
sites or treatment facilities, 
ensuring compliance with 
environmental regulations 
and minimizing ecological 
impact.
The initial step is to be 
organised with the project 
with waste management 
in mind. This involved 
figuring out what materials 
will be required, how to 
utilize them and how to get 
rid of them.

Corporate Overview
Prestige Group has implemented comprehensive processes to safely reclaim and manage products at the end of their life cycle, 
ensuring environmentally responsible practices across various waste categories:
a)	
Plastics (including packaging): Using high GSM plastics and recycling, Prestige Group emphasizes sustainable practices 
such as converting wet waste into organic compost through OWC (Organic Waste Converter) machines.

Verbal complaints made by employees will be noted as grievances, but a formal 
grievance is officially recognised only when dissatisfaction is formally submitted 
in writing. Grievances often stem from significant discontent among employees 
or groups, covering issues such as wages, payment methods, leave, transfers, 
positions, promotions, treatment by superiors, adherence to codes of conduct, and 
even the quality of food in the canteen. The introduction of a Grievance Redressal 
Mechanism within the organisation aims to effectively handle and resolve 
employee concerns and complaints, whether from permanent or temporary staff. 
This mechanism guarantees every employee the right to voice their grievances and 
establishes a structured procedure for resolution. Key considerations in designing 
this redressal mechanism include ensuring equitable treatment of employees at all 
times, addressing employee complaints promptly and courteously, and ensuring 
fair and efficient resolution of all grievances.
1. 	
Employees may report complaints and grievances related to any unethical 
activity, whether malicious, mala fide, or frivolous, under the Whistleblower 
policy
2.	
Any person who has been aggrieved or, in cases where the affected individual 
is unable to lodge a complaint due to physical or mental incapacity, death, 
or other circumstances, may raise concerns under the Sexual Harassment 
Policy to the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC).

Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Yes/ No). 
If yes, the coverage such system?
 
 
The construction industry presents significant health and safety risks for site workers due to factors such as working 
at heights, operating heavy machinery, exposure to adverse weather, and frequent occupational hazards. These risks 
can lead to serious injuries, financial losses, and damage to the company’s reputation.
	
	
Construction Safety Management involves systematically identifying, preventing, and managing risks on construction 
sites to protect the health and safety of workers, the public, and the environment. It includes various practices, 
policies, and procedures designed to create a safe working environment and prevent accidents and injuries.
	
	
At Prestige Group, we have implemented a rigorous Occupational Health and Safety Management System (OHSMS) 
to identify, assess, and mitigate workplace health and safety risks. Our safety measures include AEDs, fire alarms, 
CCTV surveillance, regular fire drills, and strict enforcement of safety helmets and electrical safety protocols. We 
also have a clinic from a renowned hospital in our parking area, complete with an ambulance for immediate medical 
assistance.
 
 
We recognize that each construction site has unique challenges, so we have appointed dedicated Safety Officers at 
each location. These officers provide focused oversight, tailored solutions, and continuous monitoring to effectively 
mitigate risks. They play a crucial role in enhancing safety management, reducing hazards, fostering a culture of 
safety awareness among workers, and significantly improving worksite safety.

Corporate Overview
This principle recognises that businesses function within an interconnected ecosystem that encompasses stakeholders 
like shareholders and investors. It further acknowledges that their operations have consequences for natural resources, 
habitats, communities, and the environment. The core emphasis of this principle lies in the acknowledgment that businesses

of their products, operations, and methodologies for their stakeholders.
At Prestige Group, we actively engage with a broad spectrum of stakeholders including investors, customers, employees, and 
local communities to understand their needs and expectations. Through regular consultations and transparent communication 
channels, we ensure stakeholder feedback is integrated into our decision-making processes. We also collaborate with various 
community organisations to drive social development initiatives, addressing local needs and fostering long-term relationships. 
This inclusive approach not only fosters cooperation and trust but also enhances the social impact of our projects.

No significant risks or concerns arose from assessments of health and safety practices and working conditions of value 
chain partners during the year. The contract terms mandate that our value chain partners uphold safe working conditions. 
Our safety policy applies universally to all contractors working on project sites. As previously discussed, comprehensive 
health and safety protocols, including risk identification and corrective measures, are shared across the entire project. The 
Group ensures suppliers adhere to relevant occupational safety and health laws and requirements for a safe and healthy 
work environment. Scheduled and unscheduled audits may be conducted to verify supplier compliance. Non-compliance 
will prompt recommendations for corrective action, which must be accepted and implemented within specified timelines.

Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and social 
topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board-
	
Prestige Group undertook a stakeholder-driven materiality assessment. Feedback on environmental, social, and 
governance (ESG) matters was gathered via digital surveys from stakeholders such as employees, vendors, contractors, 
clients, channel partners, and management committee members. The inputs collected were analysed by management 
and approved by the Board. Over the reporting period, guided by sustainability experts, the organisation reviewed its 
material topics in alignment with global rating agencies, reporting frameworks, and peer comparisons, and developed 
corresponding sustainability targets.
2.	
Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, and social 
topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these topics 
were incorporated into policies and activities of the entity. -
	
We regularly consult stakeholders to identify key environmental and social concerns. Using a materiality framework, 
we assess our top risks qualitatively and quantitatively across various dimensions. Our approach aligns with integrated 
reporting capitals and the latest GRI frameworks. Oversight of local stakeholder engagement is managed by our ESG 
Committee and reviewed by the Board. The ESG Committee, overseeing materiality assessments, identifies critical 
Company issues. For effective stakeholder communication we implement standardised debriefing processes, develop 
training modules, and host internal conferences where local managers exchange best practices.
3.	
Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/ marginalised 
stakeholder groups-
	
We enhance worker social protection through partnerships with NGOs and regulatory bodies. We prioritise local 
procurement from Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), contributing to local economic growth.

Annual Report 2023-24
The principle recognises that businesses function within an ecosystem that involves various stakeholders, shareholders, 
and investors. Moreover, it acknowledges that the emphasis on fundamental human rights such as treatment of workers, 
human rights policies and the initiatives based around honouring these rights influence the business environment, the 
reputation of internal stakeholders and determine the value of the entity’s reputation. This principle underscores the 
necessity for businesses to protect their workforce operations, conduct, and the trust of stakeholders while also diminishing 
and effectively addressing the unfavourable consequences. These rights are perceived as intrinsic, inalienable, interlinked, 
and indivisible.
At Prestige Group, we prioritise human rights across all aspects of our operations. We enforce strict policies to prevent 
discrimination, harassment, and exploitation, ensuring a safe and respectful environment for all stakeholders. By adhering to 
international human rights standards and local requirements, we promote fair labour practices and safeguard the rights of our 
employees, suppliers and community members. We also conduct regular audits and training programs to ensure compliance 
and raise awareness about human rights issues. This unwavering dedication to human rights sets us well on our path to being 
an ethical and responsible organisation.
Key Highlights
	
Zero complaints received on grounds of forced labour, child labour, discrimination or issues related to wages.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If yes, then provide details-
	
Yes, the Prestige Group has undertaken several projects aimed at reducing Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. These 
initiatives include:
	
a)	
Solar Panels: The Prestige Group has installed solar panels across several of its properties. These panels harness 
solar energy to generate electricity, significantly reducing reliance on fossil fuels and thereby cutting down GHG 
emissions.
	
b)	
Purchasing Renewable Energy: The Company actively purchases renewable energy from external suppliers. By 
sourcing energy from renewable sources such as wind, solar, and hydroelectric power, the Prestige Group minimises 
its carbon footprint and supports the growth of the renewable energy sector.
	
c)	
Energy-Efficient Products: The Prestige Group emphasises the use of energy-efficient products in its projects. This 
includes the installation of LED lighting and the use of 5-star rated appliances, which consume less energy and 
contribute to lower GHG emissions.
	
d)	
LEED and Green Buildings: Many of the Prestige Group's buildings are designed and constructed to meet LEED 
(Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) standards, as well as other green building certifications. These 
buildings incorporate sustainable practices such as energy-efficient HVAC systems, water-saving fixtures, and the 
use of eco-friendly materials, all of which contribute to reduced GHG emissions.
	
e)	
Building Automation Systems (BAS): The Prestige Group integrates advanced Building Automation Systems in 
its properties. These systems optimise energy use by controlling lighting, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning, 
thereby reducing energy consumption and associated emissions.

10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by 
your Company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices 
adopted to manage such wastes-
	
The Prestige Group has implemented comprehensive waste management practices across its establishments to ensure 
responsible disposal and minimise environmental impact. These practices include:
	
a)	
Waste Sorting and Categorisation: All waste is meticulously sorted based on its characteristics, categorising it 
into hazardous, non-hazardous, biodegradable, and non-biodegradable types. Hazardous waste, mainly consisting 
of waste oil from diesel generator sets, as well as paint and varnish remnants, is responsibly disposed of through 
authorised third-party vendors in compliance with State Pollution Control Board regulations.
	
b)	
Biodegradable Waste Management: For biodegradable waste, the Prestige Group adopts an eco-friendly approach 
by converting it into organic manure. This manure is then used for landscaping at operational sites, preventing 
biodegradable waste from ending up in landfills and significantly reducing fugitive methane emissions.
	
c)	
Wet Waste Management: Wet waste, including kitchen waste, is segregated, and kept in separate green bins or 
buckets. This waste is disposed of in green bins with lids, without lining, and collected every morning to ensure proper 
handling and processing.
	
d)	
Dry Waste Management: Dry waste, such as packing materials, paper, and wrappers, is disposed of in blue bins or 
buckets, which are collected on Wednesdays and Saturdays in the second half of the day. This segregation facilitates 
efficient recycling and disposal of dry waste.
	
e)	
Medical and Sanitary Waste Management: Medical and sanitary waste is wrapped in newspaper and disposed of in 
red bins with lids, which are collected every morning. Sanitary waste is sealed properly before disposal to ensure safe 
handling and reduce health risks.
	
f)	
Mixed Garbage Segregation: The segregation of mixed garbage at the source (home) level is emphasised to ease the 
burden on housekeeping staff and ensure more efficient waste management practices.
	
g)	
Organic Waste Composter (OWC): The Prestige Group uses Organic Waste Composter (OWC) units to recycle wet 
waste, converting it into compost that can be used for various purposes within the premises.
