DIRECTOR’S MESSAGE
BUSINESS 
RESPONSIBILITY & 
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT
Sustainability is integral to NGL Fine-Chem Limited’s (referred to as ‘NGL’ or ‘The Company’) business strategy, 
empowering it to flourish amid evolving landscapes. Innovation and adaptability are central to the Company’s 
approach, and are essential for navigating challenges and fostering resilience. The Company prioritises 
transparency, accountability, and ethical conduct across its operations, maintaining an indomitable commitment 
to purpose-driven business.
Through comprehensive reporting, NGL aims to update stakeholders on its Environmental, Social, and Governance 
(ESG) performance, showcasing its progress and impact. This communication underscores the Company’s 
dedication to driving meaningful change and creating sustainable value for all stakeholders.
However, the Company faces several critical challenges, including the adoption of emerging technologies at 
competitive costs, particularly for its products, and navigating the transition to clean energy. Over the past year, 
NGL has intensified its efforts to foster sustainability commitments.
The Company has been working to achieve carbon neutrality and has become water-positive in its operations, 
including investments in energy efficient products and processes. Ensuring the health and safety of its workforce 
is of utmost importance, alongside partnerships with waste recyclers and community support initiatives through 
CSR engagement. These actions underscore the Company’s dedication to sustainable practices and responsible 
corporate citizenship.
NGL views sustainability as an ongoing journey, recognising there’s always more to be accomplished. It is 
committed to embracing challenges and enhancing its business practices through transformation.

1.
ESG 
compliance
Risk
Risk: ESG compliance 
risk is associated with 
non-adherence to the 
standards and guidelines 
set forth by all local 
and global regulatory 
agencies, focussing 
on pharmacovigilance, 
proprietary, confidentiality 
and other core governance 
standards (For instance,

others)
1.    Focussing on stable and 
larger markets.
2.    Strengthening regulatory 
capacity in key markets 
by actively engaging with 
regulatory agencies and 
hence mitigating risks 
from external sources.
Positive: Compliance 
with relevant regulatory 
requirements pertaining to 
the ESG domain reflects the 
Company’s commitment 
towards responsible 
business practices.
Negative: Non-compliance 
with ESG and regulatory 
requirements may affect

3.
Managing 
waste
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Waste, water and 
energy management 
have been identified 
as key material issues 
under the climate change 
and environmental risk. 
This risk is addressed 
to emphasise on the 
Company’s climate 
consciousness and its 
contribution towards 
mitigation action plans 
against climate change.
Opportunity: 
Comprehensive resource 
management plans aligned 
with NGL’s environment 
conservation strategy will 
highlight the Company’s 
commitment towards 
improving environmental 
preservation and its 
contribution towards 
climate change mitigation 
action plans
1.    Ensuring compliance 
through robust 
governance and 
review mechanisms, 
strengthening 
capabilities of the EHS 
and legal compliance 
teams, conducting 
risk assessments 
and periodic reviews, 
and implementing 
compliance management 
software to track and 
monitor adherence to 
all relevant regulatory 
requirements.
2.    Undertaking proactive 
initiatives to mitigate 
the physical and 
transitional risks linked 
to climate change, 
such as, decarbonising 
operations, GHG 
emission reduction 
measures, and physical 
climate risk assessment 
to safeguard assets from 
the effects of climate 
change.
3.    The Company adheres 
to the precautionary 
principle (as outlined 
in the Rio Declaration 
1992) through the ERM 
framework to mitigate 
environmental risks.
Positive: The Company’s 
focus on strengthening 
climate and ESG-specific 
initiatives bolsters long-
term value-creation and 
enables the Company to 
effectively respond to rising 
stakeholder demands.
Negative: The lack of 
robust initiatives and action 
plans to contribute to ESG 
awareness and climate 
change could adversely 
impact the Company’s 
operations and lead to work 
force disruption.
4.
Occupational 
health and 
safety
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Occupational health 
and safety is a critical 
aspect of the Company’s 
commitment to workforce 
welfare, emphasising the 
importance of providing a 
safe and secure working 
environment. Identification 
of a high number of health 
and safety incidents 
reflects the effectiveness 
of the existing EHS 
management approach.
1.    Implementing a robust 
EHS management 
system with periodic 
internal and external 
audits of safety 
practices.
2.    Adopting comprehensive 
corrective action 
plans following the 
identification and 
assessment of safety 
incidents to prevent 
future instances.
Positive: A robust 
occupational health and 
safety management 
approach enables the 
Company to prevent the 
occurrence of incidents.
Negative: Frequent safety 
incidents and injuries 
may adversely impact the 
Company’s performance, 
both in terms of safety and 
workforce well-being.

Opportunity: A strong 
EHS management 
system integrated with  
comprehensive hazard 
identification, mitigation 
plans, root cause analysis 
of the reported incidents 
and corresponding 
corrective action plans, will 
highlight NGL’s approach 
and dedication to ensuring 
workforce health and 
safety.
5.
Climate change
Risk
Extreme weather events 
linked to climate change 
can disrupt supply chains 
and manufacturing 
operations, thereby 
affecting the production 
and distribution of NGL’s 
products. For example, 
events such as heat 
waves or excessive rainfall 
in the areas where the 
Company’s manufacturing 
facilities and offices 
are located can lead to 
increased absenteeism, 
thereby impacting the 
overall efficiency of the 
Company.
NGL conducts mandatory 
safety training and 
awareness sessions across 
its operations, including 
manufacturing sites and 
offices. These sessions 
cover emergency evacuation 
procedures, especially 
important during natural 
disasters.
Negative: Since this is a 
systemic risk, the Company 
cannot fully control the 
same, and instead,  strives 
to mitigate it to a certain 
extent. 
6.
Talent 
development
Opportunity Investing in talent 
development gives the 
Company a strategic 
edge, promoting individual 
growth that enhances 
organisational agility and 
competitiveness.
Prioritising employee 
growth nurtures a 
culture of continuous 
improvement and positions 
companies as preferred 
employers, attracting top 
talent and ensuring long-
term success.

Failing to uphold business 
ethics can expose a 
company to significant 
risks. Engaging in unethical 
behaviour can harm the 
Company’s reputation and 
erode public trust, resulting 
in the loss of customers, 
investors, and other 
stakeholders.
The Company adheres 
strictly to its Code of 
Conduct, which serves as a 
comprehensive guide for all 
employees on values, ethics, 
and business principles.
The Company’s Whistle

a mechanism for the 
employees to report any 
unethical or improper activity 
concerning the Company to 
the Chairman of the Board
