Opportunity 
Risk: The absence of a comprehensive 
Human Rights governance structure 
from the aspects of parameters such as 
working conditions, fair remuneration, 
gender diversity, prevention of sexual 
harassment, freedom of association,

social domain from the perspective of

community. 
 
Opportunity: The presence of a strong 
redressal 
mechanism 
outlines 
the 
Company’s commitment to Human 
Rights protection. A better organized 
and more respected workforce is more 
stable, predictable, and productive, 
which reduces the risk of resource 
shocks and creates productivity gains, 
which is beneficial for a company’s 
bottom line. Legal costs due to

better understand their viewpoints and meet their requirements. These continuing collaborations enable 
us to discover and track major economic, environmental, and social trends that may be incorporated 
into our entire company plan. At CONCOR, the stakeholder engagement system is a fundamental 
driving force in building and broadening stakeholder relationships, hence facilitating the identification 
of key material concerns affecting the Company's growth. The stakeholder interaction resulted in the 
prioritising of material concerns, mapping of the risks pertinent to each material subject, and the 
formulation of subsequent risk mitigation procedures. The fundamental consequence of the stakeholder 
engagement process was the identification and prioritising of material concerns including the 
environment, social, governance, and economic elements. The identified major challenges were given 
to the highest governing member and the Board for comments and assistance on developing the 
Company's sustainable growth strategy. The stakeholder engagement exercise is reviewed on a regular 
basis as part of the Company's ongoing efforts to interact with internal and external stakeholder groups 
in order to identify major material concerns affecting them.

Whether stakeholder consultation is used to 
support the identification and management of 
environmental, and social topics (Yes / No).  
If so, provide details of instances as to how the 
inputs received from stakeholders on these 
topics were incorporated into policies and 
activities of the entity.  
Yes, CONCOR has always maintained a frequent and proactive interaction with the Company's major 
stakeholders, allowing it to successfully work on its ESG strategies while being honest about the 
results. In response to current rules and stakeholder interactions, the company conducts periodic 
assessments to update and reissue policies as appropriate. 
3 
Provide details of instances of engagement with, 
and actions taken to, address the concerns of 
vulnerable/ marginalized stakeholder groups.  
CONCOR is constantly cognizant of its responsibility and works with the most disadvantaged and

stakeholders such as SMEs and MSMEs through our CSR initiatives. We communicate with them often 
using need assessments and other participatory ways to better understand their needs and the impact of 
our initiatives. For further information, please see the CSR section of the website. –
