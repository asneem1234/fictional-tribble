Our R&D department is not only focused on upgrading our technology 
but also focused on making our products more sustainable. To reduce the 
environment and social impact of our products the department works on 
projects considering   reduction of weight of our product and optimal use 
of oil in operations, improvising safety features and operational efficiency. 
Our R&D/Manufacturing department created a process for producing higher 
quality class gears to reduce meshing losses, which increases gearbox 
efficiency and reduces power loss. Furthermore, higher quality gears 
minimize noise levels, which is critical for the environment.

In the previous years we had installed solar systems to increase our 
renewable energy consumption. In addition to this in FY 2023-24, we have 
undertaken following initiatives to increase our operational energy efficiency 
as under:
Ground mounted solar generation at other premises having capacity of 2 
MW.
Installation of new plate cutting machine with upgraded environmental and 
operator’s health features.
Replacing older & out dated more power consuming equipment with energy 
efficient new equipment as well as loss prevention.
2.	
a. 	
Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)
	
	
Yes
	
b. 	
If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?
	
Yes, the Company has formulated an operating procedure to approve vendors. Materials are procured from approved vendors 
both, local and international. The quality assurance team of the Company conducts periodic audit of the vendors, especially 
those who supply key materials and there is very specific focus towards the conservation of energy, water & environment 
as well as safety at their end. 
3.	
Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of life, 
for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.
	
Our product line comprises products predominantly made of metals, accounting for around 99% of the composition. This 
metal content renders our products highly recyclable. The materials used, including ferrous and non-ferrous elements, 
contribute to a robust and sustainable life cycle lasting approximately 20-25 years. As a result, direct reclamation of our 
products for recycling post their life cycle is currently unviable. 
	
Our product manual serves as a tool to raise awareness among customers, advocating for the recycling of used products 
through designated recyclers. At the end of their life cycle, our products do not generate plastic, e-waste, hazardous waste, 
or any other form of waste, aligning with our commitment to environmental sustainability.
4. 	
Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes / No). If yes, whether the waste 
collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to Pollution Control Boards? If 
not, provide steps taken to address the same.
	
Yes, we are disposing the waste in line with the EPR requirement to registered recyclers.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details.
	
Yes, this year we have set up a 2 MW capacity of solar rooftop, significantly contributing to our organization’s sustainability 
efforts by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, to achieve net-zero emissions in our operations, we’ve 
established our own windfarm, which generates electricity supplied to the grid. We receive credits for the units contributed, 
effectively reducing our electricity bills. Our renewable energy infrastructure boasts a total installed capacity of 4.7 MW in 
solar rooftop and 13.85 MW in windfarms. Through the utilization of these renewable sources, we’ve successfully avoided 
CO2 emissions.
	
We are committed to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions in alignment with the Science-Based Targets initiative 
(SBTi), target validation will get done this year. Our emission reduction target will be established based on identified 
decarbonization strategies, including the adoption of renewable energy, enhancing energy efficiency, and implementing 
fuel-switching measures.

Company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted 
to manage such wastes.
	
We closely monitor waste management techniques. Automated machining of gear parts addresses this issue by minimizing 
the amount of metal scrap generated. We generate a substantial amount of metal scrap, which is then reused in our foundry 
shop to make castings. Hazardous waste (used oil) contaminated empty containers (carboys, tins, cans, etc.) are disposed of 
to an approved recycler in accordance with regulatory requirements. Our foundry produces a substantial volume of burnt 
sand, which is used by recyclers in the infrastructure and building industries.
