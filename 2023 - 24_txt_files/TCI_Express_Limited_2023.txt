1.
Energy 
Risk 
Negative
The transportation network in logistics heavily depends on fossil fuels and the 
development of logistics routes also causes natural resource depletion worldwide. 
Apart from resource depletion, transportation activities have numerous adverse 
impacts, such as carbon dioxide emissions, noise and waste generation.
Our reliance on non-renewable energy sources, particularly fossil fuels for 
transportation of goods and energy consumption in our operations, contributes 
significantly to greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. This not only poses 
environmental risks but also exposes express logistics Companies to the 
unpredictability of fuel prices and potential supply chain disruptions. Furthermore, 
inefficient energy usage can escalate operational costs, impacting overall 
profitability.
Goal Setting: The Company has established short-term and long-term emission 
reduction targets, in alignment of global net zero agenda.
LED Lighting: Replaced traditional lighting with energy-efficient LED lights.
Solar Photovoltaic Panels: Over the past two financial years, our Gurugram and 
Pune sorting centres have adopted solar photovoltaic panels and generated a total 
of 17,32,082 KWH from renewable sources.
Automation: Implemented automation to improve efficiency and reduce energy use.
Investment: Invested in newer, more fuel-efficient vehicles or alternative fuel vehicles 
such as hybrid, or those powered by natural gas.
E-Invoicing for Operational Efficiency:  The adoption of e-invoicing leads to 
notable efficiency gains through the elimination of paper-based processes. Digitizing 
invoicing reduces the need for physical documentation, minimizing paper usage and 
associated energy intensive printing processes. 
2.
Emission/ 
carbon 
footprint
Risk
Negative
Fuel generated from transport vehicles produce greenhouse gases, that contribute 
to climate change.
These environmental impacts have significant economic consequences, driving up 
costs, causing business disruptions and leading to market instability. Additionally, 
greenhouse gas emissions contribute to air pollution, posing health risks to 
individuals and communities.
Upgrade to Fuel-efficient Vehicles: Replaced older, less efficient vehicles with 
newer models that have better fuel efficiency and lower emissions.
Routes Optimization: Using route optimization system to reduce fuel consumption 
and emissions by minimizing distance traveled and avoiding traffic congestion.
Driver Training Programs: Imparting drivers in eco-driving techniques to reduce 
fuel consumption.
Hybrid Vehicles: Invest in hybrid vehicles to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.
Alternative Fuels: Use biofuels, hydrogen, CNG or other alternative fuels that have 
lower carbon footprints.
Regular Maintenance: Ensure vehicles are regularly maintained to operate at peak 
efficiency.
Compliances: Ensure compliance with all relevant environmental regulations and 
standards.
3.
Talent 
Attraction 
and 
Retention
Opportunity
Positive
Effective talent attraction and retention in a Company can create significant 
opportunities by fostering a skilled and motivated workforce. This leads to 
enhanced innovation, productivity and competitive advantage, as employees are 
more likely to contribute creative solutions and remain dedicated to the Company’s 
goals. Moreover, a strong reputation for talent management attracts top-tier 
candidates, ensuring a continuous influx of high-quality talent, which further drives 
the Company’s growth and success.

Cyber 
security
Risk
Negative
Cyber threats pose significant risks to express logistics Companies due to their 
reliance on digital infrastructure and data-driven operations. Here’s how:
Data Breaches: A data breach can result in the exposure of information, leading 
to financial loss, reputational damage and legal consequences.
Disruption of Operations: Cyberattacks such as ransomware can disrupt 
operations by encrypting critical systems or data. This downtime can result in 
delays, missed deliveries and financial losses.
Supply Chain Disruption: A cyberattack on any link in the supply chain can 
disrupt the flow of goods and services, leading to delays, increased costs and 
customer dissatisfaction.
Reputational Damage: A cyberattack can severely damage a Company’s 
reputation, eroding customer trust and loyalty. 
Risk Assessment: The Company conducts time to time risk assessment to identify 
vulnerabilities and potential threats to its systems and data. 
Encryption Protocols: The Company has implemented robust encryption protocols 
to safeguard the flow of data and imposing stringent restrictions on access to web 
resources.
Access Control: The Company has implemented strict access control measures to

cybersecurity best practices.
Firewalls and Prevention Systems: We have deployed firewalls to monitor and 
control incoming and outgoing network traffic and utilize intrusion detection and 
prevention systems (‘IDPS’) to detect and respond to potential threats in real-time.
Regular Updation: The Company Keeps software and systems up to date with the 
latest security patches and updates. 
Backup and Recovery Plans: We maintain regular backup of critical data and 
systems and store backups offline or in a separate, secure location. 
5.
Customer 
management
Risk
Negative
Loss of Reputation: Poor customer service can damage the Company’s 
reputation.
Operational Inefficiency: Poorly managed customer relationships can lead to 
inefficiencies in operations, such as incorrect deliveries, missed deadlines and 
increased costs associated with addressing customer complaints and returns.
Loss of Business: In the competitive express logistics industry, retaining 
customers is crucial for sustained growth. Dissatisfied customers are more likely 
to switch to competitors, leading to a loss of business.
Threat to Business growth: By neglecting customer management, the Company 
may miss out on opportunities for organic growth and expansion.
Legal and Compliance Issues: Failure to meet customer expectations or 
contractual obligations may result in legal disputes or regulatory penalties. 
Raising Complaints: The Company has an effective customer service and support 
processes to ensure timely and satisfactory resolution of customer inquiries and 
issues. For this purpose, the Company has provided various touch points for the 
customers to raise complaints or share feedback such as a tollfree number, e-mail, 
a dedicated page on the website, social media platforms.
Recording of Complaints: The complaints are recorded in an online application in 
the Company’s system, where customers are provided with realistic turnaround time 
and resolved on a priority.
Escalation of Complaints: The Company has established an escalation procedure, 
which is communicated to the customers.
Feedback: The Company provides a feedback link to the customer with every 
order, to regularly seek customer satisfaction level and feedback to identify areas for 
improvement and address customer concerns.

where they are sensitized with basic etiquette of handling customers, product 
handling, customer service skills, communication skills, etc.

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted to 
reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage 
such wastes
	
As a consignment hauler, our operations naturally lead to minimal hazardous waste generation, primarily due to the nature 
of express delivery and the limited scope of waste production, especially hazardous and toxic waste. We recognize the 
significance of addressing waste management, particularly focusing on identified waste types. Therefore, our Company has 
embraced the 3R approach - Reducing, Reusing and Recycling - as a fundamental strategy to effectively manage waste 
and advocate for environmental sustainability.
	
We have set up dedicated areas for sorting different types of waste (e.g., recyclables, hazardous waste, general waste) to 
ensure proper disposal and recycling. The Company has also system in place for separation of biodegradable garbage. 
Most waste generated is directed to authorized recyclers, underscoring TCI Express’s commitment to safe and responsible 
waste disposal practices. The waste generated within its premises is recycled through authorized recyclers and remaining 
disposed off through State Pollution Control Board (‘SPCB’) approved landfill areas.
	
The Company has also established e-waste collection bins across its offices, centers and branches nationwide, providing 
employees with a means to deposit their electronic waste. Even for the management of smaller volumes of hazardous 
waste, such as used oil, the Company ensures compliance with local regulations by collaborating with recyclers, approved 
by the SPCB for proper treatment and disposal.
	
We have adopted digital invoices and dockets, along with electronic certificates of freight, that significantly aid in reducing 
paper waste. Recycling initiatives for materials such as cardboard, plastic and pallets have been established to ensure 
proper processing of logistics materials. Additionally, we have integrated fuel-efficient practices and technologies into our 
transportation operations to minimize fuel waste and emissions.
	
As part of our commitment to reduce plastic consumption, our Company policy prohibits the procurement of single-use 
plastic water bottles for office use. Through our sustainable packaging practices (though limited considering nature of our 
express logistics services), we strive to achieve a harmonious balance by ensuring the secure transportation of goods and 
minimizing the environmental impact of our operations.

Recording of Complaints and their Resolution
	
The Company has a dedicated customer care department (‘CCD’) to manage customer grievances from the initial complaint 
registration to its successful resolution. Our dedicated team ensures swift handling and timely resolution of all complaints 
and feedback, which are logged and tickets are created based on the nature of complaints.

complaint management system. Each recorded complaint is assigned with a specific ticket number through the system 
and is allocated to a dedicated team member at the backend of the respective region. The backend CCD’s executive 
follows up and coordinates with the relevant team to resolve the issue. The final resolution is then shared with the customer 
through the respective mode of complaint, raised by the customers.
	
The Company also provides an escalation procedure for customers who are not satisfied with the response. They can 
escalate the matter by visiting the ‘contact’ link on the website and following the provided details. In case of escalation, a

complaint.

to resolve complaints within a set timeframe. We ensure that customers understand the status of their concern and provide
