Yes, we have implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge at Shrirampur plant as per the details given below :-
Effluent Treatment and disposal Plant (ETP) Details (ZLD)
Effluent Treatment Plant-
Effluent treatment through anaerobic digestion or bio-methanation : TI has installed and commissioned three anaerobic 
reactors or digesters having combined treatment capacity of 400 Kilo Liters (KL) effluent (Raw Spent Wash) per day. 
Effluent Disposal Systems-
A] Separation of clear water from BME through Disc Tube Reverse Osmosis (DTRO) Separation System :TI has installed a DTRO 
plant having treatment capacity of 250 KL effluent per day. 
B] Effluent disposal through Concentration and Incineration System :
i) Effluent Concentration through Multiple Effect Evaporator (MEE) plant-TI has installed Multiple Effect Evaporator for the 
concentration of effluent. Its installed treatment capacity is 475 KL effluent per day. 
ii) Effluent Incineration in bagasse-fired boiler : -TI has installed and commissioned a bagasse-fired boiler which is specially 
designed to use a mixture of effluent concentrate and bagasse. 
To achieve this, effluent concentrate coming out of MEE plant and bagasse is mixed manually in the proportion of 40:60. 
The mixture is dried and used as fuel in boiler.
