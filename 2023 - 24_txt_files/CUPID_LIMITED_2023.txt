implications of the

(Indicate

implications)
1
Affordability and pricing
Opportunity
Health care cost containment and access 
regulations could put downward pressure 
on pricing in the Medical Equipment & 
Supplies industry. This pressure might 
intensify due to the consolidation of 
health care providers and the influence 
of government-sponsored insurance 
programs. The Company aims to ensure 
fair pricing that can mitigate the adverse 
effects of cost containment and benefit from 
increased revenue opportunities through 
expanded access. 
Not Applicable
Positive
2
Product Safety
Risk
Product safety issues and side effects might 
emerge after clinical trials and approval. 
In such scenarios, Companies may face 
financial risks from recalls and other 
negative events, including bad press, fines, 
or investigations. Problems like equipment 
failures, manufacturing defects, design flaws, 
or insufficient risk disclosure can lead to 
substantial liability claims for the Company. 
To mitigate the risk of product safety issues 
and side effects that may arise post-approval, 
we strictly adhere to all safety precautions and 
guidelines, with a strong emphasis on maintaining 
high-quality standards. This rigorous approach 
helps minimize the likelihood of equipment 
failures, manufacturing defects, design flaws, and 
insufficient risk disclosures, thereby reducing the 
potential for substantial liability claims, recalls, 
fines, and investigations.
Negative.
There has been no 
negative impact 
in the reporting 
period of 2023-2024.
3
Ethical Marketing
Risk
Companies in the Medical Equipment 
& Supplies industry encounter legal 
and regulatory challenges related to 
product marketing. Advertising directly to 
consumers and reaching out to physicians 
can help companies expand their market 
share. However, marketing off-label uses 
presents risks, including substantial fines 
and settlements. 
To mitigate the legal and regulatory challenges 
associated with product marketing, we have 
initiated a compliant marketing strategy for 
our brand. This strategy involves channel sales 
through super stockists, wholesalers, retailers, and 
direct customers, ensuring standardized pricing 
across the country.
Negative.
There has been no 
negative impact 
in the reporting 
period of 2023-2024.

Product Design and 
Lifecycle Management
Risk
Companies in the medical equipment 
and supplies industry are increasingly 
challenged by the human and 
environmental impacts of their products. 
They face pressure from consumers and 
regulators to reduce the use of materials 
linked to health risks and to address energy 
efficiency and end-of-life disposal issues. 
To mitigate the risks associated with the human 
and environmental impacts of our products, 
we are committed to using safer, eco-friendly 
materials that minimize health risks. We also 
focus on improving the energy efficiency of 
our manufacturing processes and products. By 
proactively addressing these concerns, we aim 
to meet the expectations of consumers and 
regulators, thereby reducing potential liabilities 
and enhancing our sustainability efforts.
Negative.
There has been no 
negative impact 
in the reporting 
period of 2023-2024.

Supply Chain Management
Risk
Ensuring the quality of the supply chain 
is crucial for safeguarding consumer 
health and maintaining corporate value. 
Transparency regarding the implementation 
of supply chain audit programs can offer 
investors insight into the measures taken by 
the Company to preserve shareholder value.
To mitigate the risk related to supply chain quality, 
we ensure stringent oversight of all suppliers 
to safeguard consumer health and maintain 
corporate value. By maintaining transparency 
about our supply chain practices, we provide 
investors with clear insights into our commitment 
to preserving shareholder value. This includes 
rigorous standards for supplier selection and 
continuous monitoring to ensure compliance with 
our quality expectations.
Negative.
There has been no 
negative impact 
in the reporting 
period of 2023-2024.
6
Business Ethics
Opportunity
The Company shall aim to navigate the 
complex landscape of international, 
national, and local laws designed to prevent 
health care fraud and abuse. This involves 
adhering to regulations that vary by region 
and country, which can include stringent 
anti-fraud measures, ethical standards, 
and reporting requirements. Ensuring full 
compliance across all areas of their global 
and domestic operations is crucial.

Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its coverage and

Although the Company does not currently have a Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) system in place, they are committed to 
sustainable water management. They are implementing an Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) to treat and reuse wastewater. 
The ETP process begins with effluent collection in a storage tank, followed by pumping to the Chemical Coagulation and 
Flocculation Tank. Here, coagulants and flocculants are added to facilitate the removal of fine particles, which are then settled 
in the Primary Settling Tank. The clarified effluent is transferred to the Primary Tube Settler and then to the Aeration Tank, 
where fine bubbles enhance oxygen transfer efficiency. The biologically treated effluent is subsequently filtered through 
Sand Media and Activated Carbon Filters to eliminate suspended impurities and odors. The filtered water is stored in a 
treated water tank and is used for gardening and toilet flushing within the factory premises. Additionally, effluent settling 
powder is used in a filter press to remove sludge, and dissolved oxygen levels in the Aeration Tank are regularly monitored 
to maintain a minimum of 2.0 mg/L.
