Employee Health 
and Well Being
O
It 
is 
our 
Company's 
overarching responsibility to 
effectively manage the well-
being of all employees and 
workers by providing a secure 
working environment, which 
is supplemented by formal 
occupational health and safety 
training programs 
Positive 
Implications
2.
Climate Action
R
Exposure to climate related risks 
and opportunities significantly 
affects the company’s long-
term operations and ﬁnancial 
sustainability. Without proper 
measurement, monitoring, and 
reduction of emissions, the 
company could be subjected 
to regulatory actions
Our 
company 
prioritizes 
environmental 
protection 
by adhering to government 
regulations concerning water, 
air, and waste management.
Additionally, 
we 
promote 
resource conservation among 
our 
employees. 
We 
have 
adopted measures to reduce 
our carbon emissions and 
invested in initiatives such as 
renewable 
energy 
sources 
(Installation of solar panels at 
our Head Ofﬁce).
Negative 
Implications
3.
Transparency in 
Governance
O
We have a robust Governance 
system in place to address 
issues 
concerning 
bribery, 
corruption, and other unethical 
behaviour. 
Our 
Code 
of 
Conduct is very comprehensive 
in nature and covers various 
aspects of governance and 
ethical conduct. We also have 
a Whistle Blower Policy and 
in place that governs all our 
stakeholders to report any kind 
of protected disclosures.
Positive 
Implications
4.
Talent 
Management
O
Our 
workforce 
is 
the 
cornerstone 
of 
our 
organization’s 
success. 
The long-term viability and 
prosperity of our company 
depend on our ability to attract 
and retain skilled employees. 
Inadequate 
reward 
and 
recognition 
programs 
can 
result in higher attrition rates 
and 
talented 
individuals 
moving to our competitors.

company operates. We recognize the need to thrive within our immediate environment in which we operate responsibly by 
implementing sustainable practices. Since its inception, our company has persistently launched various initiatives to amplify 
ESG-based practices and make successful headways in various verticals. Till date, key issues have been successfully 
addressed, including proper disposal and treatment of bio-medical waste, water conservation by implementing water-
saving reducers, transitioning to e-billing to reduce paper usage and adoption of solar panels. The Company has invested 
in Efﬂuent treatment plants for its labs and Sewage treatment plants at its Head ofﬁce to ensure both the lab waste water 
as well the general waste water is adequately treated before its discarded through the drain lines. The Company also 
plans to invest in the organic waste compost plants to treat and reuse its dry and wet general waste. Additionally, majority 
of the communications, messaging and announcements to our channel partners is now being done digitally instead of 
using traditional physical collaterals. Our company is cognizant of its ethical responsibilities as a corporate citizen and 
continuously acts in adherence to moral principles.

1.	
Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the board on economic, environmental, and 
social topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the board.
	
The Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) committee typically initiates consultations on economic, social, and governance 
(ESG) topics through relevant functional heads. These functional heads or designated executive team members are tasked 
with engaging directly with the respective stakeholder groups to gather insights and feedback. Should the consultation 
process be delegated, the feedback from these engagements is meticulously compiled and communicated to the Board, 
ensuring that the Board remains fully informed and can make decisions based on comprehensive stakeholder input. 
This structured approach ensures that critical economic, environmental, and social topics are thoroughly discussed and 
appropriately addressed at the highest level of the organization.

Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identiﬁcation and management of environmental, and social

Has the entity implemented a mechanism for 
zero liquid discharge (ZLD)?
Yes
If yes, provide details of its coverage and 
implementation.
The Company has installed Sewage Treatment Plant at its corporate ofﬁce. This 
plant effectively treats the wastewater generated on-site and the treated (recycled) 
wastewater is being used for day to day purposes such as toilet ﬂush. Additionally, 
all the labs within the Company have their own efﬂuent treatment plants installed 
to ensure proper treatment of wastewater before it is discharged from the labs.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing GHG emission? If yes, then provide details.
	
The entity does not currently have any speciﬁc projects exclusively aimed at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. 
Nonetheless, the company is keenly aware of its environmental impact and has implemented several initiatives to mitigate 
it. At the organization’s head ofﬁce, a Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) has been installed to ensure that wastewater is treated 
effectively before being discharged. Additionally, all laboratories are equipped with Efﬂuent Treatment Plants (ETPs) 
to manage and treat laboratory wastewater appropriately, thereby minimizing the risk of environmental contamination. 
Moreover, the company adheres to stringent bio-medical waste management practices. It disposes of bio-medical waste 
through authorized Bio-Medical Waste (BMW) vendors, ensuring safe and compliant handling of potentially hazardous 
materials. In efforts to reduce electricity consumption from the grid, solar panels have been installed at two of the 
company’s laboratories as well as at the head ofﬁce. This initiative not only supports renewable energy use but also 
contributes to a reduction in overall electricity consumption, indirectly lowering their environmental footprint associated 
with traditional power sources. Overall, while there is no direct project explicitly labeled as GHG emission reduction, these 
combined efforts reﬂect the company’s commitment to sustainable environmental practices and energy efﬁciency.

by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the 
practices adopted to manage such wastes.
	
Our establishment adheres to a comprehensive waste management strategy that ensures the effective segregation 
and treatment of all waste generated. We categorize waste into four distinct codes: Red, Yellow, Blue, and Black. Each 
category facilitates speciﬁc handling and treatment protocols: - Red and Yellow waste categories undergo pre-treatment

processes such as autoclaving, ensuring these potentially infectious materials are rendered safe before any subsequent 
steps. - Blue and Black categories are managed according to their speciﬁc requirements, ensuring compliance with 
relevant regulations. To manage the bio-medical waste generated in our laboratory, we adhere to the stringent guidelines 
set forth by the Bio-Medical Waste Management Rules of 2016. This waste is either recycled or safely disposed of through 
partnerships with the State Pollution Control Board, which oversees both the recycling and dispensation processes. 
We have developed and implemented Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for waste management. These SOPs 
cover the entire waste lifecycle, from separation and handling to storage and transportation, ensuring a systematic and 
compliant approach to bio-medical waste management. Our strategy to minimize the usage of hazardous and toxic 
chemicals involves continuous research and development to identify and integrate safer alternatives into our products and 
processes. By investing in sustainable practices and materials, we aim to reduce our ecological footprint while maintaining 
high standards of safety and efﬁcacy. Regular training programs and audits are conducted to ensure compliance with 
environmental regulations and to foster a culture of safety and responsibility among our employees. In summary, our 
waste management protocols represent a holistic and rigorous approach to environmental stewardship, focusing on the 
effective segregation, treatment, and disposal of bio-medical waste, while our ongoing efforts to minimize hazardous 
chemical usage demonstrate our commitment to sustainability and compliance.
