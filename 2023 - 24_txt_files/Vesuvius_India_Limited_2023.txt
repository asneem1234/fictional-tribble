Introduction: Think beyond. Shape the 
future.
Welcome to our Second BRSR Report. We 
genuinely appreciate your interest in the journey 
of Vesuvius.
Climate change stands out as the paramount challenge 
of our era. The urgency lies in our ability to coexist and 
progress without exhausting the vital resources essential 
for the future. If we fail to master sustainable development 
practices, the unchecked trajectory of climate change has 
the potential to propel us towards severe and far-reaching 
consequences. Addressing climate change extends beyond 
mere environmental conservation; it is a profound social 
responsibility. Achieving a dynamic equilibrium between 
human activities and the intricate systems of the natural 
world is essential. It calls for a harmonious balance where 
societal advancements and environmental preservation 
align, acknowledging the interconnectedness of human 
well-being and the health of the planet. The imperative is not 
only to protect our environment but to cultivate a responsible 
and sustainable cohabitation with the Earth, ensuring the 
sustainable future of both our societies and the ecosystems 
we inhabit.
Sustainability serves not merely as a policy but as foundational 
principles shaping the conduct of our company’s business 
and everyday operations. To translate policy into action, 
Vesuvius Group made a commitment in 2020 by endorsing 
and becoming a global signatory to the United Nations 
Global Compact (UNGC). Since that commitment, we have 
wholeheartedly dedicated ourselves to pursuing initiatives 
that advance the fundamental principles outlined by the 
UNGC, encompassing Human Rights, Labor Standards, 
Environmental stewardship, and Anti-Corruption.

2023 Highlights of Our Sustainability 
Priorities
Building on the unequivocal successes of previous years, 
Vesuvius India takes pride in showcasing the highlights of 
the key objectives and priorities of its sustainability initiatives 
for FY 2023. These endeavors undoubtedly establish the 
foundational pillars for a better tomorrow, encompassing “Our 
Planet, Our Customers, Our People, and Our Communities.”
Our planet
Our commitment to reducing energy consumption and 
mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions traces back 
to 2011 with the initiation of Vesuvius’ Energy Conservation 
Plan. Beyond enhancing energy efficiency, we have actively 
shifted towards cleaner energy sources. Non-renewable 
energy sources, once prominent in our industrial processes, 
have been phased out and replaced with lower carbon-
intensive alternatives such as renewable form of energy like 
Solar. Furthermore, since 2019, we have embarked on a 
transition to non-CO2 emitting sources of electricity. Aligned 
with the Paris Agreement, we have set a target to achieve 
net-zero CO2e emissions by 2050 (Scope 1 and Scope 2).
Our roadmap to net zero is based on five key 
areas of focus:
•	 No significant change to our business model and 
product portfolio
•	 Modernising and upgrading installed equipment to reduce 
our energy consumption
•	 Investing to renew equipment to the best available 
technologies and converting to less CO2 intensive 
energy sources

Corporate Overview
•	 When possible, replacing high CO2e emission electricity 
(generated from coal) with greener electricity or other 
sources of energy
•	 Reducing our energy wastage, recovering heat to feed 
processes and hot water
•	 Generating clean energy
Our progress in 2023:
•	 New capital expenditure dedicated to projects with 
energy efficiency and CO2 emission reduction as one 
of the prime objectives, was initiated by the Group and 
followed by Vesuvius India. Consequently, a significant 
expenditure was incurred on energy-saving equipment 
during the reporting year.
•	 Throughout the reporting year, energy optimisation 
projects were initiated across all our manufacturing 
sites. Projects included the replacement of air-operated 
diaphragm pumps with electrically operated diaphragm 
pumps for glaze circulation, the installation of new screw-
type water chillers for central air conditioning systems, 
the implementation of VRV-type air conditioning systems 
in offices, and the optimisation of high-temperature firing 
cycles, among others.
•	 Continuing our commitment to electricity consumption from 
carbon-free sources, in FY 2023, we expanded our solar 
power generation capacity. Two new rooftop solar power 
facilities of 250 kWP and 130 kWP were commissioned 
for our Kolkata and Vizag plants, respectively. Following 
these installations, our total solar power generation 
capacity reached 1,694 kWp, representing nearly 19% of 
our total consumption.
Striving 
for 
net-zero 
emissions 
to 
underscore 
our 
commitment to environmental protection extends beyond 
energy conservation at Vesuvius India. We proactively 
work to minimise resource consumption and promote a 
circular economy throughout both ends of our supply chain, 
encompassing both upstream and downstream activities. 
These initiatives specifically target the reduction of water 
consumption and waste generation.
One noteworthy initiative involves the implementation of 
returnable packaging solutions for our customers. This 
sustainable packaging approach has already been put into 
practice as a pilot project. The initiative not only contributes 
to the reduction of packaging material consumption but also 
addresses Scope 3 CO2e emissions.

Corporate Overview
In an exceptional accomplishment, Vesuvius India has clinched both Gold and Silver awards in the World Refractory 
Association (WRA) Safety Award category, positioning us as global leaders in safety excellence during the reporting year. 
1 million hours worked without a Lost in Time Injury (LTI) and an impressive 5 years without LTI earned us 13 WRA Safety 
Certificates which signify our steadfast commitment to safety excellence.
Addressing 
climate 
change 
extends 
beyond 
mere 
environmental conservation; it is a profound social 
responsibility. Therefore, Vesuvius India is wholeheartedly 
committed to enhancing gender diversity in operations, 
aligning with the global objective to foster inclusivity across 
all levels and role functions progressively. Additionally, we 
are considering the initiation of a pilot project to incorporate 
females in non-management roles, thereby expanding 
opportunities for women to excel in a broader spectrum 
of positions. This commitment extends to supporting the 
education of women and girls in Science, Technology, 
Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) and creating more 
“female-friendly” workstations in select plants. Recognising 
that we operate within an industry traditionally perceived as 
masculine, our challenge extends beyond merely increasing 
the number of women in our teams. It involves fundamentally 
transforming our culture. It’s not just a numbers game; 
it’s about reshaping perspectives and attitudes. We are 
actively engaged in crafting a new playbook, one that goes 
beyond token representation and strives for the creation 
of an effective, high-performing, and genuinely diverse 
organisation. In reality, our female representation not 
only at the corporate offices and manufacturing locations 
but also at the customer locations have increased during 
previous years. This journey involves redefining our mindset, 
fostering inclusivity, and developing strategies that facilitate 
the success and growth of every individual within our 
diverse workforce.

Corporate Overview
Aligned with PLC approach, Vesuvius India too identifies 
following areas where exposure of child labor and modern 
day slavery may pose a higher risk:
•	 Mining and extractive industries (raw materials)
•	 Textiles (personal protective equipment and work clothing)
•	 Transport and packaging
•	 Maintenance, cleaning, agricultural work, and food 
preparation (contracted workers)
To put policies in practice, we often engage with our suppliers 
to assess these Human Rights and Labor Standards risks 
and collaborate if necessary.

A brief on types of customers
	
Vesuvius products are used by diverse customers across high-temperature industries including:
•	 Steel Producers: Steel manufacturers form a significant part of Vesuvius’ customer base. They utilise Vesuvius’ 
refractory products for their furnaces, ladles, and tundishes. These refractories withstand extreme temperatures, 
ensuring safe and efficient steel production. Vesuvius’ solutions enhance the flow control of molten metal, minimise 
heat loss, and improve overall operational performance. For steelmakers, Vesuvius is a trusted partner in maintaining 
productivity, quality, and safety.
•	 Foundries and Aluminum Smelters: Foundries, where metals are cast into specific shapes, benefit from Vesuvius’ 
expertise. Their refractory linings enable precise casting and prevent metal contamination. Similarly, aluminum 
smelters rely on Vesuvius to optimise their electrolytic cells, reduce energy consumption, and enhance metal purity. 
Vesuvius’ products contribute to cost savings, environmental sustainability, and consistent production.
•	 Cement and Lime Plants: In the cement industry, Vesuvius’ refractories line rotary kilns, ensuring efficient clinker 
production. Lime plants also utilise Vesuvius’ solutions for their calcination process. These refractories withstand 
extreme heat, chemical reactions, and abrasion, leading to prolonged equipment life and reduced downtime. Cement 
and lime producers appreciate Vesuvius’ role in maintaining their critical processes.
•	 Petrochemical and Non-Ferrous Industries: Refineries, petrochemical plants, and non-ferrous metal producers (such 
as copper, aluminum, and nickel) rely on Vesuvius. Their refractories withstand aggressive chemical environments, 
high temperatures, and thermal shocks. Vesuvius’ solutions enhance process efficiency, reduce emissions, and 
extend equipment life in these industries.

26.	 Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues
	
Our Sustainability initiative is centered on addressing our most significant sustainability issues and opportunities. These 
are determined through an ongoing double materiality methodology which we adopted. This methodology is formed by 
the European Sustainability Reporting Standard (ESRS). Vesuvius plc first adopted the approach which Vesuvius India 
is also following. The standard identifies and priorities issues based on two dimensions: the impact or likely impact of 
our activities on the environment and society at large, consequently affecting on Vesuvius India’s business creating 
financial risks and opportunities.
	
This materiality assessment is grounded in our risk management processes, which consider not only immediate risks 
to the Group but also longer-term emerging macro trends. These trends include factors such as the electrification of 
light vehicles, the growing demand for renewable energies, technological advancements in iron and steel making, and 
policy changes affecting the cost of CO2 emissions. These trends could significantly impact our markets.
	
Our assessment aligns with the principles of global reporting frameworks. To shape our assessment and develop our 
sustainability initiative, we actively engage with various stakeholders through both formal and informal channels. This 
includes regular surveys of Vesuvius’ operational teams to gather data on management approaches, systems, and 
performance related to environmental, safety, human resource management, and society at large.

achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
	
We are pleased to introduce Vesuvius India’s 2nd Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) for the Financial Year 
2023, which showcases our dedication to sustainability, ethical business practices, and societal well-being. This report highlights 
our commitments and performance concerning our employees, customers, and communities where we operate. As reiterated in our 
previous report, we remain aligned with the UN Global Compact (UNGC), UN Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs), and the 
global pledges of our parent company, Vesuvius PLC. Our focus continues to be on environmental stewardship, social impact, and 
governance excellence.
	
At Vesuvius India Limited, we consider the well-being of our planet and society as integral to our success. Sustainability is not just 
a responsibility but a fundamental aspect of our business operations. We recognise that our present actions shape the future of our 
company, customers, communities, and the environment at large. This report offers a detailed account of how we integrate these 
values into our business strategy, corporate culture, and daily practices.
	
Throughout the reporting year, we focused on increasing the use of solar power in all our manufacturing plants in India. As a 
company committed to environmental stewardship, we are dedicated to reducing our carbon footprint. While electricity remains a 
primary energy source for our operations, we have voluntarily purchased Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) to offset the carbon 
emissions associated with electricity generation, demonstrating our commitment to environmental sustainability.
	
We regularly assess our sustainability efforts and adjust our priorities to ensure long-term sustainable growth and value creation for all 
stakeholders, including investors, business partners, and our employees. To enhance the safety of our employees and support their 
professional development, we have conducted numerous training programs, investing close to 1,00,000 man-hours in training during 
the reporting period. Additionally, we have implemented stringent safety protocols and procedures to minimise workplace risks.
	
In closing, we express our gratitude to our stakeholders for their continued trust and support. We believe that this enduring trust will 
empower us to think beyond and shape the future.

segregation process. This allows us to assess opportunities for reuse and recycling. Following evaluation, reusable 
elements are reintegrated into the value chain, while recyclable elements are directed to authorised recyclers. Other 
than the solid wastes often used lubricants are safely disposed through authorised vendors after onsite ETP treatment.
	
For instance, a pilot project has been initiated for one customer, focusing on the implementation of returnable packaging 
comprising a metal box. This particular solution aims to reduce waste and promote a more sustainable future of 
packaging of our products. Currently, we are actively exploring the possibility of initiating the solution in the entire of our 
downstream distribution.

to report the work-related hazards and to remove 
themselves from such risks. There are multiple ways 
to involve workers in the improvement of Occupational

routinely engaged in safety audits. They can raise 
the concern during audits. VSAT a mobile digital 
platform to capture hazards and remove themselves 
from the work area or process. People without 
access to VSAT can raise their concern through Line

take decision. Our Take 2 initiative ensures that 
employees cross check safety requirements before 
performing any high risk or nonstandard activity.

discuss the task, any hazards and how to prevent 
accidents before starting any work. This process 
allows the team to consider and reflect on hazards 
and the controls required before work commences.

Efficient energy usages are the paramount concern of Vesuvius India Limited. We incessantly strive to achieve excellence 
in the manufacturing process for lowering energy consumption per ton of products to minimise detrimental environmental 
impacts. To underscore our environmental commitments, we focused on increasing the use of solar power in all our 
manufacturing plants in India. As a company committed to environmental stewardship, we are dedicated to reducing 
our carbon footprint. While electricity remains one of the primary energy sources for our operations, we have voluntarily 
purchased Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) to offset the carbon emissions associated with electricity generation, 
demonstrating our commitment to environmental sustainability. However, due to addition of certain products into our 
portfolio, furnace firing cycles during the reporting year have increased significantly resulting into higher energy intensity. 
Additionally, we have expanded our production facilities across all the plants which also have caused into enhanced energy 
consumption. Nonetheless, adequate corrective actions are already initiated for energy conservation which will in turn lower 
energy intensity in years to come.
Note: Indicate if any independent assessment/ evaluation/assurance has been carried out by an 
external agency? (Y/N) If yes, name of the external agency –
The reported data encompasses all Vesuvius India manufacturing units located in Kolkata, Vishakhapatnam, and Mehsana. 
While there is no independent assessment of the energy data, our data recording system is highly robust. The same data is 
reported to the Group through the environmental data reporting system, undergoing group-level verification.
Moreover, energy intensity management, achieved through both demand-side and supply-side interventions, is a crucial 
aspect of our overall greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction target. This target is an integral part of Vesuvius plc’s global commitment 
to reducing its carbon footprint, aiming to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 at the latest (https://www.vesuvius.com/en/
sustainability/our-planet.html). Our solar energy generation initiatives are being continued during the current year and are 
expected to further expand in the future.

As an environmentally proactive organisation, water conservation is not just a responsibility for Vesuvius India, but an 
integral part of how we define ourselves. As our operations grow organically, Vesuvius India has seen a steep increase in 
its workforce as well as we have an expansion of production facility resulting into increased water intensity during reporting 
year. Nonetheless, adequate timely measures are already commenced to meet our sustainability objectives with regard to 
efficient usage of water. Mehsana plant of Vesuvius India Limited has already achieved Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) status. 
Other locations such as Kolkata and Vizag are also in line to increase their water recyclability and reusability to reduce 
usages which in turn positively affect our water intensity in years to come.
Note: Indicate if any independent assessment/ evaluation/assurance has been carried out by an 
external agency? (Y/N) If yes, name of the external agency –
The reported data includes water consumption for all manufacturing units of the Company situated in Kolkata, Vishakhapatnam, 
and Mehsana. Although water consumption within our manufacturing plants has been decreasing due to efficient use, there 
was a cumulative increase in water consumption. This rise is primarily attributed to the high demand for water necessitated 
by plant expansion and various construction projects initiated during Q1 of the reporting year. It’s important to note that this 
visible increase in water usage should be considered a one-off case.
Additionally, the company has started recycling of water in the multiple wash booths of manufacturing processes which in 
turn further utilised in the same wash booths after an additional treatment. The Company reuse ETP outlet water in our 
manufacturing processes and domestic usages, thus by saving additional pumping in of supplementary 3rd party water.
While there is no independent assessment of the water intake data, our data recording system is highly robust, and the 
same data is utilised by our global organisation Vesuvius plc., undergoing group-level periodic verification. Despite our 
manufacturing process not being water-intensive, water security remains a crucial aspect of our sustainability program. The 
Company is consistently exploring ways to reduce water intake, emphasising the importance of every drop in our commitment 
to responsible water management. Quality of treated water before discharge is routinely monitored by the respective State 
Pollution Control Boards approved laboratories. Routine communication with the respective statutory authority are done 
as well.

Essential Indicators
1.	
Describe the mechanisms in place to receive and respond to consumer complaints and feedback.
	
The Company manages customer complains through a very robust system which starts with initiation of “Customer 
corrective action request (CCAR)” in our CCAR database (centralised platform to register, monitor and close CCAR) 
followed by high quality time bound closure of the issue through the well-established 8D process.
	
CCAR Procedure
	
Initiation- A CCAR can be recorded by any Vesuvius employee for any product or service that has been provided to 
the Customer. Sales is responsible for ensuring that the issue is communicated immediately and that actions are taken 
to define and contain the issue within 24 hours of learning of the occurrence. The CCAR should be formally submitted 
within 4 days of learning of the occurrence. The principle is that any customer issue linked to our product, its application 
or our service at the customer, direct or indirect should lead to a CCAR. In any case, a CCAR must be submitted in any 
of the following circumstances, regardless of whether we think the problem is our responsibility:
•	 Any written customer complaint formally communicated to us.
•	 Any phone call from the customer requesting an urgent visit for a quality related issue.
•	 Any verbal expression of dissatisfaction by the customer during a visit; only exception: – if this relates to the 
application of our product and can be resolved during the same visit, then a CCAR is not needed, but nevertheless, 
be mentioned in the visit report. – If a further visit is needed to resolve the issue, than a CCAR is required
•	 Any incident where our product is involved
•	 Any free of charge replacement of product already received by the customer if quality related. • Any credit note(s) if 
quality related.
•	 Any product non-conformance discovered at the customer site (delivery, packaging, broken pcs, specification…)

Corporate Overview
	
Containment actions- As soon as we learn about an incident, customer protection is an absolute priority. It includes 
but is not limited to:
•	 Immediate visit to the customer
•	 Quarantine and replacement of doubtful products all along the supply chain.
•	 Inspection and sorting of the quarantined products; this may require third-party involvement. 
•	 Adequate communication with the customer to protect the relationship. The removal of products in customer hands 
must be considered as a mandatory containment action to protect the customer. It does not entail acknowledgement of 
our responsibility. The immediate containment actions have in any case to be implemented before the next shipment.
	
Repeats- A repeat CCAR is required for any similar problem with a similar product at the same customer, for any 
subsequent shipment within 24 months. The statistics count only repeats within 12 months. Exception is when the 
customer or the Group Quality Director formally grants a concession for a defined time or number of shipments. In such 
circumstances, an additional repeat CCAR shall be raised each month for any additional customer rejects. In the case 
of the trial to confirm corrective actions (D7) failing.
•	 if the execution of the trial was a failure, then a CCAR is needed.
•	 if however the result of the trial is that the proposed fix did not work, then that is not a CCAR
	
Severity- Assigning Severity to a CCAR is mandatory, and is defined as follows:
	
Severity 1: an injury; a dangerous occurrence that could result in a severe accident/incident*; a problem at our external 
customer’s customer, Another significant customer disruption or potential financial impact*
	
Severity 2: a production/installation stoppage at our customer; delivery issues stopping the customer or forcing him to 
change his production schedule.
	
Severity 3: other dangerous occurrences; reduced service life of the product; significant delivery issues; other failures.
	
Severity 4: other product or service issues; other delivery timing/quantity issues
	
CCAR is handled, resolved with proper root cause analysis using 8D PPS (8-Discipline of practical problem solving) 
methodology and learning of it is implemented to prevent recurrence and further shared for horizontal deployment at 
other Vesuvius plants and locations.
