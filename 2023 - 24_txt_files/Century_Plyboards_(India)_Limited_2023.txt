Performance of the entity against the
specific commitments, goals, and
targets along-with reasons in case the

1.
Demonstrating its commitment to responsible business practices, CPIL prioritizes 
environmental sustainability. Since wood is their main material, they constantly
strive to reduce resource consumption and its environmental impact. One key
approach is sustainable procurement, with nearly 98% of their timber sourced
through agroforestry practices. Additionally, the Company’s  facilities actively
promote resource optimization through waste reuse and recycling. Wood waste is 
recycled in-house to create particle boards and MDF, while non-recyclable waste
is used as fuel in the  boilers, thereby minimizing  reliance on non-renewable fossil 
fuel. SAP inventory management ensures that chemical waste is managed and
minimized. The Company’s ongoing energy efficiency and emission reduction
initiatives involve installing energy-efficient equipment, such as replacing several 
Thermic Fluid Heaters with a single high-capacity advanced unit, replacement
of old kiln chambers to new automatic energy-efficient chambers in the board
and door frame sections, and substituting outdated air-conditioners and diesel
generators with newer, more efficient versions. Additionally, the Company has
introduced electric forklift trucks and other electric vehicles.
These initiatives have significantly lowered CPIL's energy and emission footprint
2.
The Company has integrated pertinent Human Rights guidelines into its BRSR
policy, setting clear expectations for stakeholders, including business channel
partners, investors, and contractors, to uphold human rights values. The company 
actively promotes human rights awareness throughout its value chain. For the
reporting period FY 2023-24, zero cases of human rights violation were identified
and reported to the management and the Board.

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges,
targets, and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
Dear Stakeholders,
CPIL is a leading company that deals with wood products and constantly analyses the market trends to stay at par with its
industry peers. We align our production with the evolving consumer expectations and demand. While doing so, CPIL also
acknowledges the need for sustainable alternatives and has focused on producing eco-friendly products that meet the global
benchmarks and industry best practices. As of present, the Company sources about ~98% of its timber requirements through
plantation activities by equipping the local farmers around its manufacturing facilities with subsidized saplings of plant
varieties like eucalyptus and other trees around their field. Committed to environmental responsibility, CPIL actively seeks
alternative materials, reduces non-renewable energy consumption, and optimizes its supply chain for sustainable distribution
and transportation. As the pioneers in Borer Proof Plywood and Boiling Water Resistant (BWR) Decorative Veneers and Laminates 
in India, we have successfully created a niche in the highly competitive lifestyle segment Prioritizing customer satisfaction and 
industry leadership, we foster strong partnerships through exceptional service, continuous innovation, and embracing industry 
trends. Through this report, we will ensure to provide our stakeholders with a better insight into the Company’s commitment
to developing long-term value for its shareholders and incorporating ESG into every facet of CPIL’s overall business approach.
The organization’s environmental and sustainable responsibilities include the eco-conscious usage of natural resources like
fossil fuels, efficient wastewater treatment, responsible waste management practices and other measures to tackle the effects
of climate change. Demonstrating social responsibility, CPIL prioritizes investments in employees, vendors, and communities,
fosters communication through their 'Centurion' intranet portal and 'Centurion Helpdesk' WhatsApp group, all while addressing 
industry challenges like rising costs and competition with a focus on continuous improvement in environmental and social
impact. CPIL is deeply committed to becoming a sustainability leader. This is evident by the efforts to source 100% of the
timber through partnerships with the local farmers who make use of the sustainable agroforestry practices. This achievement
is attributed to their switch to biomass fuel. CPIL is also committed to welfare of the communities and there are several projects 
undertaken including social welfare initiative like "Education for all" seeks to educate children of our factory workers as well as
adjacent areas, free of cost. Furthermore, CPIL is continuously investing in renewable energy sources, implementing energy-
efficient practices across operations, and allocating resources towards R&D for innovative solutions to industry challenges. We
express its deepest appreciation to all stakeholders for their unwavering support and looks forward to continued collaboration
in the future.
Kind regards, 
Sri Sanjay Agarwal

2.
a. 	 Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)
Yes, CPIL has procedures in place as the central procurement team has been integrating sustainable sourcing in its 
operations. Procurement of raw materials is based on the forecasted production and sales for the upcoming periods, this is 
being achieved through effective communication amongst our different departments. Before onboarding new vendors, the 
central procurement team evaluates the vendors on parameters like emissions generated, human rights violation, health 
and safety, etc and verifies them through ISO certifications and statutory compliances to ensure whether the vendors are 
aligned with CPIL’s processes.
To minimize and further prevent any negative environmental impacts from the sourcing of our raw materials, we 
practice agroforestry and plantation of timber. We distribute samplings to farmers around the manufacturing locations 
to encourage extensive plantations of fast-growing, short-rotation plant species and promote agroforestry. To meet our 
face veneer requirements, we have set up a veneer processing unit in Gabon. Moreover, to minimize transportation costs 
and streamline delivery time for our dealers, we have strategically expanded our distribution network. This initiative has 
led to improved warehouse and inventory management capabilities. To reduce freight costs, the Company uses an ERP 
(Enterprise Resource Planning) system to manage its distribution strategy. These measures help CPIL to save money 
and time on transportation while also conserving the environment through reduced fuel consumption and lower carbon 
emissions. To lessen its dependency on fossil fuels, the Company deploys higher tonnage capacity trucks/ containers for 
transportation.
As part of our commitment to building a sustainable supply chain, we primarily sources machinery, spare parts, 
consumables, and packaging materials from medium and small-scale manufacturers and suppliers located near our 
manufacturing facilities. We also procure raw materials from various self-help organizations and conducts awareness 
sessions for the suppliers on social and environmental issues. We also offer managerial and technical support to these 
suppliers to enhance their productivity, output quality, delivery times, and cost-efficiency. Furthermore, a significant 
portion of our production-line workforce is recruited from the communities surrounding its factories.
b.
If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?
~98% of input is sourced through agroforestry across all divisions.
3.
Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of
life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste:
The products manufactured at our facilities are mostly not packed using plastic materials as paper is being used for packaging
of the products, which further minimizes the need for reclamation. Since we as a company do not directly serve to the end-
consumers and deal in B2B business with dealers, sub-dealers, architects, etc, therefore the sensitization of safe reclamation
of products is handled by our empanelled dealers and architects.
Plastics including packaging
Plastic waste generated is disposed as per the regulations and norms through authorized 
vendors. Plastic waste generated from packaging is very minimum since only a fraction of 
the products are being packed using plastic which is disposed of as per the regulations.
E-waste
The e-waste generated through use of electronics for office and facility operation is duly 
monitored and get disposed through authorized vendors and dealers.
Hazardous Waste
The Company segregates the waste as per the different categories and ensures its safe 
disposal through Authorized vendors certified by the Pollution Control Board as TSDF 
(Treatment, Storage, Disposal Facility).
Other Non-Hazardous Waste
The majority of wood-based wastes are utilized as raw material for producing particleboard. 
Any remaining volume that cannot be used as raw material is used as fuel in boilers to 
generate heat.
4.
Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes / No). If yes, whether
the waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to Pollution
Control Boards? If not, provide steps taken to address the same.
CPIL produces minimal plastic waste since only a small portion of its products (specifically pre-laminates) utilize polythene for
packaging. The company prioritizes using paper packaging for most of its product range, thereby reducing plastic consumption. 
For exported products, Centuryply employs pellet packing. Going forward, In the future, the Company plans to register under
the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) regulations in accordance with the Plastic Waste Management Rules (PWMR)
2016. Additionally, any electronic waste generated in the company's offices or facilities is responsibly disposed of through
authorized recyclers.

3.
Percentage of recycled or reused input material to total material (by value) used in production (for manufacturing
industry) or providing services (for service industry).
CPIL prioritizes sustainable practices by continuously optimizing waste management. This includes recycling products and
minimizing waste during production. Our goal is to reduce reliance on virgin materials and minimize overall waste generation.
While some waste is inevitable during the log-to-plywood conversion process, we actively implement process technology and
operational controls to minimize it. Additionally, we utilize cutting-edge technology to join leftover wood veneers, transforming 
them into usable raw materials. Furthermore, most wood waste is either reintegrated into our production process or responsibly 
recycled through authorized vendors
Indicate input material

seven-day timeframe. The parties involved are given an equal opportunity to present their cases, and all relevant evidence is 
meticulously examined. Following the investigation, the ICC determines the validity of the complaint. If found unsubstantiated, 
appropriate action is taken against the complainant. However, in instances where sexual harassment is substantiated, CPIL 
takes immediate and stringent measures to safeguard the wellbeing and safety of the complainant. These measures may 
include, but are not limited to, disciplinary actions against the perpetrator

PRINCIPLE 9 Businesses should engage with and provide value to their consumers in a responsible 
manner.
Essential Indicators:
1.
Describe the mechanisms in place to receive and respond to consumer complaints and feedback.
At CPIL, to achieve business growth and long-term sustainability, consumer satisfaction is one of the important indicators and
through its efforts and commitment, we have always been at the forefront to provide all consumers the level of satisfaction that 
they expect from us. Since our primary business is of B2B business, therefore on a regular basis we interact and communicate
with our architects and the empanelled dealers to find out about any issues they may have with the quality of the products
or the terms of the agreement. We also have a process in place to get the feedback from our end-consumers regarding the
quality of the products through company’s B2B partners. CPIL also utilizes social media platforms and tools like email to
collect customers feedback and complaints directly. To record and document all the customer complaints and provide suitable
remedies, we have put in place a formal grievance redressal procedure. CPIL through different architects and empanelled
dealers receives consumers’ feedback and complaints on issues related to product quality. The complaint received are handled
by the marketing and sales team but in case a further escalation is required then the zonal in-charge designated for each
product line (Laminates, Plywood, Particle board, MDF, decorative veneer, New Age Products) is contacted.
2.

different dealers the company sells its products to civil contractors and architects and 
to other industries where our product is transformed into finished goods. The buyer has 
access to all the information that is being readily available by the CPIL regarding the 
products. Since NAP (New Age goods) is a unique product variation, 100% of all products 
carry information on the product itself.

2.
Steps taken to inform and educate consumers about safe and responsible usage of products and/or services.
The company at the time of purchase, provides the consumers with the necessary information, regarding safe and responsible
usage of products. Since NAP (New Age goods) is a unique product variation, information about the product is included with
100% of all the goods. CPIL as a company complies with all the applicable requirements regarding product labelling and
information display. In addition, we offer product-specific safety guidelines and the necessary information. Since the majority
of our products are utilized as intermediate products which is being used to produce a finished goods for the usage of end-
consumers, therefore, we do not actively include end users in any kind of product sensitization about safe and responsible
usage. CPIL’s architects and empanelled dealers take that responsibility.
3.
Mechanisms in place to inform consumers of any risk of disruption/discontinuation of essential services.
We consistently engage with our customers via social media and news outlets, ensuring that all important updates are
communicated through press conferences and social media channels.
4.
Does the entity display product information on the product over and above what is mandated as per local laws?
(Yes/No/Not Applicable) If yes, provide details in brief. Did your entity carry out any survey with regard to
consumer satisfaction relating to the major products / services of the entity, significant locations of operation of
the entity or the entity as a whole? (Yes/No)
At CPIL, there is a process in place to communicate to our B2B partners regarding the product-related details and information
during purchase. Since we do not directly deal with end-consumers as the product produced by CPIL is being used as an
intermediate and we do not directly engage with the customers. Based on the above information, this question regarding the
display of product information is not relevant for the company. However, to be well aligned with the changing needs of the
consumers, we ensure constant communication with the dealers, retailers as well as architects and builders through our well-
established marketing and sales teams for all product lines of CPIL.
