Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) objectives with the Company’s overarching vision. As 
part of its commitment to transparency, the Company has proudly released its inaugural Sustainability 
Report for FY23, which outlines its performance and unwavering dedication to sustainability.
Key highlights from its sustainability efforts include:
Renewable Energy Consumption: The Company’s share of renewable energy consumption 
relative to total energy usage has increased to 11.84% in FY 2023-24, up from 10.5% in 
FY 2022-23. This positive trend reflects the Company’s commitment to cleaner energy sources and 
reduced environmental impact.
Carbon Footprint Reduction: The company is actively implementing strategies to minimize its 
carbon footprint such as maximizing our Renewable energy inputs and by switching to less carbon 
fuel. We have taken the aim to become Carbon Neutral over Scope 1 and Scope 2 by the year 2030 
with baseline of 2023.
ESG Reporting: The company’s first ESG Report (FY 2022-23) has been prepared with reference to 
Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards. Going forward, the Company will continue to communicate 
its ESG strategy and progress through various channels and platforms.
The Company extends heartfelt gratitude to our dedicated team members and all stakeholders for

The Company has always believed that the success of an organization is largely dependent on the development and contribution of its employees 
and thus, it is committed to create and sustain a positive and healthy work culture through improving organizational effectiveness, providing safe 
and ethical work environment and maintaining stability and sustainability amidst growth and ever-changing business environment. CG promotes 
equal opportunity and embraces diversity. It treats all its employees with respect and dignity at all levels.

of Performance Excellence.
The Company believes in celebrating individuality and promotes diversity and inclusion. The various policies adopted by the Company have been 
instrumental in not only safeguarding the interests of the employees but also ensuring their welfare. CG’s Code of Conduct, Business Practices and 
Handbook on Company’s policies provides guidelines for employee well-being relating to participation, freedom, equality, good environment and 
harassment-free workplace. The safety of the women employees of the Company is secured by CG’s policy on ‘Prevention of Sexual Harassment.’ 
Employee related policies are updated on timely basis in line with the amendments in laws applicable for employee’s welfare. At CG, learning is 
a continuous process and hence training programs, team building sessions, workshops on various subjects were conducted on a regular basis. 
These initiatives pave a path towards strengthening their capabilities and a positive impact on the attitude of the employees.

We conducted our engagement in accordance with the Standard on Sustainability Assurance Engagements (SSAE) 3000, “Assurance

misstatement of the Identified Sustainability Information whether due to fraud or error, responding to the assessed risks as necessary in the 
circumstances.

whether the Identified Sustainability Information is free from material misstatement.
A limited assurance engagement involves assessing the suitability in the circumstances of the Company’s use of the Criteria as the basis for the 
preparation of the Identified Sustainability Information, assessing the risks of material misstatement of the Identified Sustainability Information 
whether due to fraud or error, responding to the assessed risks as necessary in the circumstances, and evaluating the overall presentation of 
the Identified Sustainability Information.

procedures, including an understanding of internal control, and the procedures performed in response to the assessed risks.
The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment and included inquiries, observation of processes performed, inspection 
of documents, evaluating the appropriateness of quantification methods and reporting policies, analytical procedures and agreeing or reconciling
