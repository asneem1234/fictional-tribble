6.	 Is there a mechanism available to receive and redress grievances for the following categories of employees and worker?
Yes/No
(If Yes, then give details of the mechanism in brief)
Permanent Workers
Yes
The Company has a grievance policy so that employees have a way to 
convey issues related to their employment. The Policy makes sure that 
these complaints are resolved swiftly, fairly, and impartially in accordance 
with the Organization’s policies. This comprises employee concerns about 
a supervisor’s, another employee’s, or Management’s behaviour, inaction, 
or proposed action in relation to them.
According to the policy’s grievance redress mechanism, the first step in 
addressing any problem is to speak directly to the other party about the 
grievance. If consultation is unsatisfactory or impossible for whatever 
reason, the employee may speak to their next-level supervisor. If the 
grievance is still not resolved at the Department or Second Level, the HR 
Head of the Site will speak directly with the other party to try to address the 
situation. Even if the issue goes unresolved, the director will be involved to 
settle the complaints and will try every option at his command. 
The policy can be access at https://www.heranba.co.in/wp-content/
