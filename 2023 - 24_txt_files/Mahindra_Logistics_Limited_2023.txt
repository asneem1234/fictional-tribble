Climate,

Transportation being the main 
activity, we are conscious 
of our contributions to 
climate change in the form of

We are a signatory to the 
Science Based Target 
initiative (SBTi) and are 
committed to becoming 
carbon neutral by 2040. 
In addition, we are a 
member of The Climate 
Pledge (TCP), collectively 
putting in efforts along 
with other member 
organisations to mitigate 
climate change.
Negative: Increased 
operating costs in meeting 
the environmental 
standards, low willingness 
among stakeholders to 
share/bear the additional 
cost
2
Customer 
satisfaction
O
It is among the top priorities 
and is very important for 
our continuously growing 
business.
Continuous formal and 
informal interactions with 
customers and annual 
customer satisfaction 
surveys assist in 
understanding the 
exact requirements and 
resolution of queries on a 
periodic basis.
Positive: Improve 
competitiveness and adapt 
to client expectations by 
leveraging our expertise in 
low-carbon solutions.
3
Energy 
efficiency
O
Energy efficiency helps 
organisations in both aspects 
of environmental impact and 
cost
This is addressed through 
our Accelerated Cost 
Efficiency (ACE) energy 
efficiency project 
implemented across 
locations with set targets
Positive: Cost savings 
and reduction in negative 
environmental impact
4
Employee 
training and 
development
O
Well-trained employees 
contribute positively to the 
operational performance of 
the organisation
Training needs are 
identified at the start 
of the year, and it is 
ensured that relevant 
training is imparted to 
the employees. Training 
has been incorporated as 
a mandatory KRA for all 
employees
Positive: Facilitate a 
best-in-class employee 
experience, thereby 
impacting our ability to 
attract, hire, train, engage 
and retain quality talent

wholesome document 
and covers all aspects, 
with regular trainings

Occupational 
health and

among others
MLL is ISO 45001 
certified, and regular 
trainings are imparted 
to employees across 
locations through various 
channels
Negative: Impact on the 
Company’s reputation and 
employees & partners’

and disrupts business.
Corporate governance 
framework
Negative: Impact on the 
Company’s reputation and

9
Supply chain 
sustainability
O
Functioning on an asset-light 
model makes our operations 
heavily dependent on 
our suppliers or business 
associates (BAs) and hence 
sustainable operations of our 
BA’s play a critical role for 
our operations
BA engagement cell plays 
a vital role for keeping 
a regular connect 
with our BAs ensuring 
smooth operations, 
regular updates, 
conducting awareness 
sessions, skill building 
etc. Select BAs were 
involved in Sustainable 
Supplier Impact Program 
organised by UNGC
Positive: Well performing 
and compliant BAs will 
provide efficient and 
uninterrupted services 
ultimately ensuring 
smooth and prospering 
business
10
Community
R
Community is a very 
important stakeholder 
for any business and can 
have extreme impacts 
positive/negative. The 
mandate on CSR spend 
as per the regulations 
by the government for 
the community with its 
publication in public domain 
is another important aspect 
that can impact a business 
activity.  
MLL is well connected 
to the urban/rural 
communities in and 
around its operations 
with listening 
mechanisms to 
understand the needs 
of the community and 
attempt to address them 
as per our CSR policy.

our CEO policy and priorities, which are cascaded to all business verticals with targets. Considering the key challenges 
and opportunities sustainability presents to the company, a Risk Committee and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) 
Committee have been constituted at the Board level to oversee the Company’s policies, programmes, and strategies 
related to environmental stewardship, climate change, responsible investment, corporate citizenship, health and safety, 
human rights, human capital management and ESG risk management; as well as other social and public matters of 
significance to the company. The CSR committee also reviews and monitors the development and implementation of the 
Company’s sustainability roadmap and reviews the Company’s public disclosures with respect to Business Responsibility 
and Sustainability Report (BRSR) mandated by the Security Exchange Board of India (SEBI). The Sustainability and CSR 
functional head is accountable for presenting Company strategy, action and performance on ESG materials to the Board

Details of total energy consumption (in Joules or multiples) and energy intensity, in the following format:
	
As a growing 3PL business, our focus has been to maintain an adequate scope of reporting across years. Customer 
demand necessitates setting-up of operations in newer geographies, which often results in the closure of old and the 
opening of new operational facilities. To enhance the scope of reporting in 2023-24, we added facilities to the scope of 
sustainability reporting, and therefore the performance on most parameters is not comparable with the previous year’s 
performance. The scope of reporting for FY 2023-24 was enhanced to 50 locations in comparison to the reporting 
scope of FY 2022-23, which was 21 locations.

Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan? Give details in 100 words/ web link.
The Mahindra Logistics – India Business Continuity Plan (BCP), from now on referred to as ‘the Plan’, contains the 
information required to recover defined critical services in the event of a disaster or emergency.
More than anything else, the BCP is a living document. It requires maintenance as the applications and technologies 
we deploy increase in sophistication and complexity. Continued changes in the scope and depth of services provided by 
Mahindra Logistics must be continually reflected in the contents of the BCP.
Its design will reduce the confusion that is inevitable with a disaster or emergency; and ensure that necessary information 
and materials for recovery will be available. Identifying requirements and documenting roles and responsibilities before the 
disaster or emergency (and its confusion) occurs will provide organisational structure and well-defined teams throughout 
the recovery process. Establishing priority for actions and events, in advance, improves decision-making processes 
and supports personnel who are quite possibly fulfilling unfamiliar roles in a challenging and uncertain environment. 
Additionally, it identifies anticipated activities for advanced knowledge and planning by Mahindra Logistics employees. This 
establishes realistic expectations and promotes the teamwork essential to a successful recovery process.
A disaster or emergency is an unforeseen event, whether man-made or natural, that prevents normal operations and 
results in potentially ruinous damage to the business, and personnel unless corrective actions are taken. The plan is 
a guide to ensure the ‘Business Continuity’ of Mahindra Logistics and our customers’ automated applications within 
documented guidelines by means of providing for emergency management and recovery strategies until critical services 
approaching normalcy are resumed.
	
Purpose - The primary purpose of this document is to provide pre-agreed actions for the employees of Mahindra Logistics 
to respond effectively in the event of a disaster or emergency. The main purpose of this document is to enable the 
Emergency Response Team to effectively respond to any of the identified or unidentified threats to our business. The 
responsibilities of the Management Team and other relevant sectional/departmental heads have been identified.

security, and perimeter security. We use advanced security tools and solutions like next-generation firewalls, border 
routers, IDS, IPS, anti-malware protection, DLP, encryption, and dual-factor authentication, among others, at each layer to
