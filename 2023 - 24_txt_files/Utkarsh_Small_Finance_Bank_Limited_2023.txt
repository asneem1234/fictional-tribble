Connecting the Dots  
Building Inclusivity, Digital Footprint and Self- Reliance
(A Scheduled Commercial Bank)
Annual Report 
2023 -24
Connecting the 
Building Inclusivity, Digital Footprint & Self Reliance
In today’s rapidly evolving financial 
landscape, Connecting the Dots plays 
a pivotal role in enabling the financial 
aspiration of Individuals and Entrepreneurs 
alike. Utkarsh Small Finance Bank 
understands this and with technological 
advancements shaping the way we conduct 
our Everyday - Financial transactions and 
business; Connecting the Dots has never 
been more apparent as it is now. 
Building Financial Inclusivity is one of the 
core beliefs of our Bank. In our opinion, 
Financial inclusivity is not just an idea but 
a formidable force that signifies access 
to essential financial services for the 
unserved and underserved segments of 
our communities. This includes access to 
banking, loans, investments, and other 
financial tools that can help individuals and 
businesses thrive. On the other hand, by 
leveraging digital technology, we believe, 
we can reach a wider audience, reduce 
costs, enable transactions on the go, and 
provide more efficient services. 
A strategic approach in seamlessly 
implementing inclusivity along with digital 
enablement leads to Self-reliance - a critical 
component of financial empowerment. 
This enables individuals to take control of 
their financial futures and make informed 
decisions about their finances. 
The Bank’s core vision towards inclusive 
finance has helped in providing 
financial assistance to the unserved and 
underserved communities in hinterlands 
across the length and breadth of the 
country spread across 888 branches in 
26 States and Union Territories. These 
are terrains which lack the hustle 
and bustle of a town or a city and are 
tucked far away in the interiors making 
it difficult to access physically.  This is 
where Connecting the Dots becomes 
even more imperative. 
Utkarsh Small Finance Bank believes 
that a holistic approach in providing 
individuals with the tools and knowledge 
to manage their finances effectively, can 
help in breaking the cycle of poverty and 
dependence, empowering individuals 
to achieve financial security and 
independence. Through greater access 
to banking, loans, and investments, 
individuals can build a strong financial 
foundation, save for the future, and 
invest in opportunities that will help 
them achieve their goals.
As we continue to advance in the digital 
age, enable economic resilience and 
move together, Utkarsh Small Finance 
Bank strives to create a future where 
financial inclusivity, self-reliance, digital 
access and prosperity are within reach 
for all by doing what it does best - 
Connecring the Dots!

Chairman’s message
We are now present across 26 
states and Union Territories with 
888 banking outlets, and are fast 
expanding our presence physically 
and digitally.
We have traversed a long and eventful 
journey of approximately 14 years 
from being a microfinance institution 
to a Small Finance Bank to a listed 
entity, with significant presence in rural 
and semi-urban locations and under-
penetrated states of India. Focusing 
on financial inclusion, we offer a range 
of financial services that address 
the specific requirements of various 
customer segments. 
Transformation driving 
business growth
Dear Shareholders,
It gives me immense 
pleasure to present you 
our maiden annual report 
after our successful listing 
on the stock exchanges 
following our Initial Public 
Offering (IPO) in July 
2023. We launched our 
IPO to raise equity capital 
of H 500 crore and it was 
oversubscribed by over 
100 times, which remains a 
momentous achievement 
for all of us. I extend my 
heartfelt gratitude to all our 
investors for the trust they 
have placed in our vision and 
strategies. I am confident 
that we will continue to 
receive your support even 
in the years ahead.

 We registered strong 
business growth 
and profitability, 
demonstrating 
the continuous 
strengthening of our 
franchise.
We are now present across 26 states 
and Union Territories with 888 banking 
outlets, and are fast expanding our 
presence physically and digitally. We 
have a differentiated branch network 
to ensure relevant product offerings 
for customers and ensuring cost 
efficiency of operations.
Operating landscape
If we look at the macroeconomic 
environment, global economic growth 
in FY23-24 has remained resilient 
with easing inflationary pressures and 
favourable employment conditions, 
despite geopolitical uncertainties and 
the risk of extreme weather conditions. 
Despite global headwinds, India 
continued to be one of the fastest 
growing major economies during the 
year. The country’s economy is likely 
to emerge as the 3rd largest economy 
of the world by 2027-28 ; and I must 
mention that the banking sector as 
a whole, especially the small finance 
banks, will play a key role in this journey. 
This is because unless the last-mile 
citizens joins the economic mainstream, 
sustainable GDP growth is not possible.
Performance in FY23-24
Our performance during the fiscal has 
been robust. We registered strong 
business growth and profitability, 
demonstrating the continuous 
strengthening of our franchise. I am also 
pleased to share that we registered our 
highest-ever annual operating profit 
(pre-provisions) of H 997 crores and a 
PAT of H 498 crores for FY23-24. 
The year also saw strategic investments 
in our infrastructure and human capital. 
We are growing our branch network 
to ensure more financial inclusion, 
especially in the rural and semi-urban 
areas. Our investments in the digital 
and business transformation initiatives 
to provide customers agile and hassle-
free services have created a strong 
foundation for future growth. Our 
business model is sustainable, scalable 
and flexible to respond to the changes 
in the operating environment.
Governance
At Utkarsh, we prioritise strong 
corporate governance. Our framework 
is built on a foundation of ethical 
practices, targeted policies, and a Board 
of Directors whose diverse expertise 
guides the Bank’s long-term success. We 
hold ourselves to the highest standards 
of transparency and accountability, 
adhering to best practices and 
continuously benchmarking our 
performance. This commitment extends 
to shareholder value creation, achieved 
through open communication and 
responsible stewardship. 
Responsible banking
Beyond immediate business priorities, 
we are also taking concrete steps to 
reduce our environmental footprint. 
From energy-saving initiatives to 
promoting solar lighting and tree 
plantation drives, we are working 
towards a sustainable future for all. We 
also understand the critical importance 
of water conservation, and we are 
implementing adequate measures to 
conserve this precious resource.
We prioritise supporting educational 
advancement and empower individuals 
with financial literacy tools. Responsible 
lending practices are critical for us, and 
we focus on supporting key sectors that 
drive economic growth.
At Utkarsh, we are champions 
of women’s empowerment. We 
provide income generation loans, 
specifically designed to foster 
financial independence and economic 
participation for women.
In conclusion, I would like to express my 
gratitude to our dedicated team, valued 
customers, investors, regulator and 
other stakeholders for their continued 
trust and support. 
Warm regards,
Parveen Kumar Gupta  
Chairman

Corporate Overview
Statutory Report
Financial Statement
The Indian economy stands out as a bright 
spot amidst global challenges. Despite a slow 
global growth trend, India’s GDP has grown 
by 8.2% in FY23-24, driven by strong 
domestic consumption and investment.  
Looking ahead, forecasts predict continued 
growth, with projections of 6.6% and 6.75% 
in the next two fiscal years, respectively. This 
momentum will be fuelled by a rising middle 
class fueling domestic spending, a digital 
push boosting tech sectors, and government 
initiatives such as ‘Make in India’ transforming 
the country into a manufacturing 
powerhouse, ultimately propelling India 
towards becoming the world’s third largest 
economy surpassing Japan and Germany.
India’s social fabric is undergoing a 
transformation, driven by a young, tech-
savvy middle class with evolving financial 
needs and aspirations. This presents a unique 
opportunity for us at Utkarsh Bank. We are 
committed to staying ahead of the curve by 
offering financial products and services that 
cater to this changing landscape.
Through continuous financial literacy 
initiatives, we are aiming to equip people 
to make informed financial decisions and 
Dear Shareholders,
The dream, the passion, the 
commitment with which your 
Bank set out to enable inclusive 
finance now stands proud and 
tall as an entity that is Public. 
The Company was listed in FY 24 
and it is an endorsement to the 
Vision and Mission of your Bank, 
which now has stakeholders with 
a wide public base. 
 
As we embark on this next 
chapter, we recognise the 
dynamic global environment that 
surrounds us. While the global 
economy is expected to witness 
a synchronous rebound in 2025, 
uncertainties remain. Geopolitical 
tensions and potential rate cuts 
by central banks in the West will 
continue to influence markets.
MD and CEO’s Message
Targeting growth with 
a stronger foundation 
Our deposit base 
grew by 27.44% to 
₹17,473 crore, driven 
primarily by a 42.93% 
increase in retail term 
deposits. This growth 
strengthens our 
liabilities franchise and 
improved our CD ratio 
to 93.66%. 
navigate the digital financial landscape with 
confidence. This will be crucial as India’s 
burgeoning young population fuels the 
demand for financial services, particularly 
those related to homeownership and career 
advancement, fueled further by rising 
disposable incomes. 
Over the years, we have prepared a stable 
foundation for growth, which is resilient, 
scalable and sustainable. As a strong banking 
platform with diverse offerings for customers 
across the socio-economic spectrum, we have 
concluded the year (FY23-24) on a positive 
note, registering encouraging business 
growth and profitability. 
The dedication and commitment of our 
people have enabled us to accomplish 
this milestone. However, this is just the 
beginning for us. Our journey ahead, as 
always, will be guided by the principles of 
financial inclusion, responsible banking and 
enhanced digitalisation across every aspect 
of the business. Besides, our diversified 
distribution network and extensive physical 
network of banking outlets have been 
pivotal in this growth.

Warm regards,
Govind Singh 
Managing Director & CEO
Looking back at an eventful  
year — FY23-24
Your Bank’s profit after tax increased in 
FY23-24 by 23.02%  to ₹498 crore. We 
undertook a comprehensive re-evaluation 
of our product offerings, processes and 
technology infrastructure. This proactive 
approach reflects our deep understanding 
of market dynamics and the need to position 
ourselves for sustained growth and long-
term relevance. Our loan book has grown by 
around 31.11% during FY23-24, in line with 
our expectations; and it reflects a diversified 
mix, with healthy upswing in both micro-
banking loans and secured loans in segments 
such as MSMEs (up 66.68%), Housing (up 
30.30%), and Commercial Vehicle and 
Construction Equipment (up 68.54%). 
We witnessed a positive trend in asset quality, 
demonstrating improved collection efficiency 
in micro-banking and strengthened efforts 
for secured loans. This is reflected in a decline 
in Gross NPAs from 3.23% to 2.51% on 
March 31, 2024, and a similar decline in Net 
NPAs. Additionally, our provision coverage 
ratio remained strong at 98.92%, indicating 
proactive management of potential risks.
Our deposit base grew by 27.44% to ₹17,473 
crore, driven primarily by a 42.93% increase in 
retail term deposits. This growth strengthens 
our liabilities franchise and improved our CD 
ratio to 93.66%. Our Bank’s CASA (Current 
Account and Savings Account) Deposits saw a 
significant uptick, rising by 25.09%, compared 
to that of the previous year. Our profitability 
remained healthy throughout the year. We 
also continued to maintain a comfortable 
capital structure, with a CRAR of 22.57% 
and Tier 1 Capital at 20.95%. This strong 
capital base allows us to support future 
growth initiatives.
Additionally, Return on Assets and Return on 
Equity remained robust, showcasing efficient 
resource utilisation. I am also pleased to 
share that the Board has announced a 
dividend of ₹0.50 per share for the year 
ended March 31, 2024.
We believe that the digital experience, which 
we have brought in the form of complete 
digital onboarding of customers for loans 
as well as savings account, eSign, E-KYC, 
digital collections through customer specific 
QR code, micro-ATM, video and other 
offerings will serve as a strong foundation 
for us to build a sustainable franchise 
with cost efficiency.
Our growth strategies
We are committed to strengthening our 
position and driving sustainable growth 
through the following measures.
Diversifying our asset portfolio:
We will continue to leverage a wide base 
of existing customers in the unserved and 
underserved segments; extend products 
offering from JLG loans to individual loans, 
affordable housing loans and other new 
products. We will also focus on offering 
working capital and term loans to MSMEs, 
small and medium sized corporates, 
institutional customers. Furthermore, we plan 
to cross-sell these products to new clients 
acquired through our existing network in 
urban and metro locations.
Expanding Liability Franchise: 
We aim to grow our retail deposits mix across 
various geographies and customer segments. 
This includes entering new markets, 
particularly the top 100 cities in terms of 
overall deposits to broaden our deposit 
base. We will also continue to strengthen 
our liability franchise by focusing on CASA 
deposits and the overall retail deposit base. 
Enhancing our digital offerings across various 
customer touchpoints will be crucial in 
achieving this objective.
Enhancing fee income 
and cross-selling: 
We will generate fee income through our 
own products and by cross-selling third-party 
offerings. We have strong partnerships in 
place and intend to develop new ones to 
expand this revenue stream. Additionally, we 
will provide convenient payment solutions 
through mobile and internet banking to 
further increase fee income.
Leveraging technology for growth: 
Technology will continue to be a cornerstone 
of our strategy. We will invest in innovative 
solutions to improve customer experience 
and utilize the vast amount of data we 
have gathered over the years. By creating 
customised analytical decision models, we 
can enhance underwriting and collection 
procedures, ultimately leading to a stronger 
and more efficient bank.
Our Commitment to 
Environment
Our commitment to Environment is a key 
area of focus.  We recognise the importance 
of responsible business practices and its 
effect on the well- being of our communities, 
While we set out build our business legacy, 
we are cognizant of the impact our actions 
would have on environment in the long 
run and therefore it is imperative that our 
business services are significantly aligned to 
the Sustainability guidelines. In line with this, 
the Bank has published its first Sustainability 
Report, which is available on our bank website 
(www.utkarsh.bank) for your convenience. 
Way forward
Looking ahead, a confluence of factors – 
rising credit demand, increasing disposable 
incomes and growing business activity in 
semi-urban areas and rural areas – presents 
an encouraging growth trajectory for us. 
With our expanding distribution network, we 
are poised to deliver exceptional financial 
services to a wider customer base, ensuring 
our continued success.

Strategic Priorities
Focused strategies for 
better business outcomes
Our experienced leadership plays a vital role in aligning our strategies with 
the aspirations of our customers for achieving better business outcomes. 
Our strategies focus on streamlining our processes and optimising our cost 
structure to ensure that we can win in the markets where we operate and 
amplify value for all stakeholders.
Diversifying asset portfolio
We have diversified our offerings over 
the past few years, and we will continue 
to do so. We plan to leverage our wide 
customer base in underserved and 
unserved segments to include individual 
loans, affordable housing loans, and 
other products in our portfolio.  Our 
efforts will be directed at extending 
working capital and term loans to 
MSMEs, small and medium corporates, 
and individuals while cross-selling to our 
existing clients in urban areas.
Increasing retail deposit mix
We aim to grow our bank deposit 
base by strategically opting for 
100 cities with the highest overall 
deposits to expand to. We will focus 
on strengthening our liability product 
franchise by increasing current accounts, 
savings accounts and retail deposit base. 
Additionally, we will leverage our digital 
capabilities to enable various touch 
points in the consumer life cycle to build 
sustainable and stable funding sources. 
Leveraging cross-selling 
opportunities
Our strategies will focus on generating 
fee income from our existing products 
and capitalizing on cross-selling 
opportunities. We are planning to 
engage with our existing partners and 
develop new synergies to increase 
the reach of our products. Our fee 
income will also rise with the increased 
adoption of digital solutions such as 
mobile payment and internet banking.
Improving technology and 
digital offerings
We understand that developing a 
digital footprint will help us expand 
our reach and serve the unbanked and 
underbanked sections. We will continue 
to invest in technology to expand our 
customer base and to provide them with 
seamless services. Our technological 
improvements will also be used for

Working towards a financially 
secured future 
I attended the 3-day training program by Utkarsh 
Welfare Foundation to pursue empowerment and 
financial literacy. They helped me embark on a 
transformative financial journey with my husband. 
I understood the importance of financial 
planning, cash flow management, saving, debt 
management, investment, digital financial 
literacy, and social protection schemes. Thanks 
to the training I received, I have now opened a 
savings bank account, availed loan services and 
enrolled in the Atal Pension Yojana to have a 
financially secure future.
Vishokha Devi  
(Katihar, Bihar)
I am proud to share my success and wish to 
encourage other women in the village to enrol their 
daughters in the Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana (SSY). 
Financial literacy can break socio-economic barriers. 
We are now empowered to dream big and achieve 
our goals in life.

I availed the facility of digital medical consultation 
for minor ailments and avoided painful and 
unpleasant travelling 4 km to the nearest Primary 
Health Centre (PHC). I am grateful to UWF for 
opening an E-clinic centre in Mahmadpur village, 
reducing my financial burden and physical distress 
related to treatment. 
Anupa Devi  
(Madmadpur, Uttar Pradesh)
I suffered from severe back pain due to long and strenuous 
working in fields and as a daily wage labour. I failed to get 
any medical assistance due to my poor financial condition. 
I was fortunate to receive free treatment and medication 
at one of the health camps organised by UWF in my village. 
I have now fully recovered from the excellent service 
provided right at my doorstep.

In the words of Mangta, “I am truly grateful to UWF 
telemedicine (E-”clinic) clinic which has changed not 
just mine but many lives in my village. I could get my 
breathing problems and back pain diagnosed by the 
doctor after suffering for a long time. I am not only 
able to work comfortably on again but also regained 
my overall quality of life after taking the three-month 
medication and diligently following the exercise routine”.

I was struggling to manage and expand my general 
store shop due to unavailability of funds. I attended 
the 3 day Mahila Udyami Sashaktikaran Program 
by UWF and was selected for capacity building and 
entrepreneurial guigance after screening from 
caders. After my intensive training in business 
skills and digital financial literacy I got her shop 
registered under Udhyam Aadhaar and even started 
filing my income tax returns on time. I  now manage 
my two shops with my husband and I am looking 
forward to opportunities for expansion.

Management Discussion & Analysis
INDIAN ECONOMY
While the global economy grappled with macroeconomic challenges, India sustained its positive growth trajectory 
in Global comment - FY23-24. India’s economy showcased a remarkable surge, with the GDP growth rate reaching 
an impressive 7.6% in FY23-24 2023-24. Driving this strong economic momentum was a substantial uptick in private 
investment spending, which grew by 10.6% year-over-year (YoY)1.
INDUSTRY OVERVIEW
Indian banking industry
Banking Sector loan portfolio is estimated to grow by 16% (excluding HDFC merger impact) and deposits estimated to 
grow by 13% during FY23-24 2023-24.
Small finance banking industry
Small Finance Banks2 (SFBs) were introduced in India with the aim to provide financial inclusion and credit access 
to underbanked and unbanked segments of the population. These banks have played a crucial role in extending 
banking services to the economically weaker sections of the society, small businesses and entrepreneurs, facilitating 
inclusive growth.
SFBs have endured various challenges over the years, including demonetisation, implementation of the Goods and 
Services Tax (GST), the NBFC crisis and the global pandemic (Covid-19). As SFBs primarily cater to economically weaker 
sections of the society / small businesses, the Covid-19 pandemic has been especially difficult for the SFBs to navigate as it 
resulted in a period of high loan delinquencies and credit costs, hindering the profitability of the industry. However, with 
the improvement in the economic landscape, resilient business model of SFBs and their healthy financial position, SFBs 
successfully navigated the crisis and regained their healthy profitability and even improved  on customer acceptability, 
brand building and overall financial performance during the period.
SFBs have been diversifying their loan portfolios, expanding in segments such as home loans, vehicle loans and MSME 
financing. While building a strong granular and retail deposits base remains a journey, SFBs have made commendable 
progress in establishing a strong deposit franchise.
The successful IPOs and listings of four small finance banks (SFBs) during FY23-24 2023-24 mark a significant milestone 
in regaining investor confidence in the sector. The healthy investor interest witnessed in these IPOs, coupled with the 
availability of adequate capital for growth and the acceptability of SFB shares among public market investors, reflect 
the investor’s trust in the sector. This achievement demonstrates the sector’s ability to overcome challenges, adapt to 
changing market conditions, and position itself as a credible investment opportunity. With eight SFBs now listed, the 
sector has gained greater visibility and credibility, attracting a broader range of investors seeking to participate in the 
growth story of these specialized banks, which cater to the underbanked and unbanked segments of the population.
The consistent focus on financial inclusion and presence primarily in relatively underpenetrated geographies and 
locations have been the primary growth driver for the SFBs. The rural and the semi-urban areas provide a vast untapped 
market; with localised approach, good understanding of the target customer base and tailored product offerings, SFBs 
have been able to steadily expand their network in the areas, capitalising on the growing demand of financial services 
from the segments.
Furthermore, improving economic landscape, rising income levels and increasing financial literacy have created 
a favourable environment for SFBs to proliferate their businesses. Increasing credit demand is providing a lucrative 
opportunity for the SFBs. It is expected that diversified product offerings and customised lending solutions will prove to 
be beneficial for small finance banks.
Microfinance industry
The Indian Microfinance Institution (MFI) industry has emerged as a crucial driver of financial inclusion. They play a 
significant role in providing access to credit, savings and other financial services to individuals and small businesses that 
are often overlooked by traditional banking channels. MFIs have become instrumental in promoting entrepreneurship, 
improving income generation and overall socio-economic development in the rural and semi-urban areas.

The microfinance industry has made concerted efforts to expand its reach into rural and semi-urban areas, and these 
efforts have yielded positive results. The microfinance loan portfolio witnessed robust growth, expanding by 25% year-
on-year to ₹3.99 lakh crore as of December 2023 from H3.21 lakh as on December 2022. This growth was supported by 
the addition of 1 crore new clients over last one year serving 7.4 crore unique borrowers.
Furthermore, MFIs are embracing technological advancements and leveraging cutting-edge solutions to enhance their 
operations and deliver better services to their customers. The adoption of digital banking platforms, usage of E-sign 
and E-KYC, complete digital onboarding and journey, data analytics and cybersecurity measures are transforming 
MFIs’ operations.
These initiatives have not only optimised efficiency and improved transparency but also enable personalised banking 
experiences, streamlined processes and enhanced security measures, ultimately contributing to the industry’s long-term 
growth and impact.
Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME)
The Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME)3 sector has significantly contributed to the India’s economic growth, 
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and manufacturing output and bolstered employment generation. According to the 
latest data, the MSME sector accounts for around 29% of the overall GDP and 36% of the manufacturing output.
Recognising the importance of MSMEs, the Indian government has implemented various schemes and programs 
to support the development of the sector. These initiatives aim to provide credit support, encourage new enterprise 
development, promote formalisation, offer technological assistance, develop infrastructure, impart skill development 
and training and facilitate market access for MSMEs.
Housing Finance
The Indian Housing Finance4 sector has recorded healthy growth in the recent years. The growth can be attributed to 
several factors, including rising incomes, enhanced affordability and substantial government support through initiatives 
such as the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). The sector has been playing a crucial role in meeting the housing 
needs of millions of individuals and have contributed significantly to the overall growth and development of the nation. 
The mortgage penetration rate in India remained modest overall but with a low penetration rate in rural and semi-
urban areas. This highlights the vast untapped potential, especially in these areas. According to estimates, the affordable 
housing segment stands as one of the fastest-growing domains, fuelled by robust government incentives and subsidies.

The interim Budget 2024-25 further bolstered this segment by announcing a scheme that will enable deserving sections 
of the middle-economic class ‘living in rented houses, or slums, or chawls and unauthorized colonies’ to buy or build 
their own homes. Furthermore, with the advent of digitization in the real estate sector, the changing demographics 
of homebuyers and the increased use of advanced technology solutions, the industry is poised for growth in the 
forthcoming years. 
Commercial Vehicle and Construction Equipment Finance
The Indian commercial vehicles market is a crucial component of the country’s economic landscape. Growth is likely 
to be driven by improvement in macro economic conditions, healthy traction in industries and replacement demand.
Similarly, the construction equipment industry in India is estimated to grow at a healthy pace. The increasing urbanization 
rate, coupled with the government’s focus on improving road infrastructure and boosting infrastructure activities, are 
driving the demand for construction equipment. Notable initiatives, such as the allocation of H 10 lakh crore (USD 122 
billion) for infrastructure in the Union Budget 2023-2024, are expected to further propel the market’s growth.

Micro-Banking Lending 
Commencing its operations from September 2009 from 
Uttar Pradesh, USFBL takes pride in establishing an 
impressive record in the microbanking sector. The rural 
and semi-urban areas are relatively underserved sections 
of the society; the Bank’s marked presence in those areas 
contributed significantly to the growth of USFBL. 
The Bank offers Joint Liability Group (JLG) loans, micro 
banking business loans to matured JLG clients and PM 
SVANidhi loans to the street vendors. The Bank offers 
loans to empower underprivileged or low-income 
individuals who have limited access to financial services. 
These loans have enabled borrowers to pursue income-
generating activities as well as facilitate some to embark 
on their entrepreneurial journey. The Bank aims to deliver 
affordable and accessible banking services to encourage 
them to achieve their dreams and aspirations. 
At the same time, the presence of JLG structure with a 
strong and frequent physical connect with borrowers, 
leads to a healthy credit discipline among the borrowers. 
These characteristics make micro-banking business an 
economically viable proposition over the cycles while 
also bringing the much-needed social impact, therefore 
proving it a real double bottom line for the business.
The growth can be primarily attributed to robust new 
customer acquisition and healthy subsequent loan 
cycle disbursements. The Bank is expected to maintain 
sustained growth in the microbanking loan sector 
owing to marked presence in relatively underserved 
geographies. Furthermore, digital onboarding for loan 
as well as savings account opening, E-sign, E-KYC, 
digital collections through customer specific QR code,

The Bank provides cashless disbursement in the micro- 
banking segment and disburses all the loans in the 
bank accounts of the customer. Furthermore, the Bank 
is continuously stepping towards increasing digital 
collections primarily through customer specific QR code 
and Bill desk payment gateway. The Bank is expecting 
increase in cashless collections going forward. The increase 
in penetration of cashless collection is likely to reduce 
operational risk pertaining to physical cash as well as 
improve the efficiency of the field staff, apart from benefit 
of cashless mode of payment to the underlying client. 
The onboarding of micro-banking clients are completed 
through E-KYC and E-sign processes that optimises

loan model which  enables the individuals to take loans 
without any collateral or security. The borrowers are 
encouraged to promote credit discipline through mutual 
support within the group, encourage prudent financial 
conduct among the group, and ensure timely repayment 
of their loans. The primary target customer segment are 
women in households, engaged in income-generating 
activities or intending to begin a new income-generating 
activity on their own. The methodology includes either 
fortnightly or bi-fortnightly centre meetings and ‘stepped-
up’ loans that can grow each time a client takes a loan 
and successfully repays it, thereby demonstrating good 
credit discipline and the need for higher amount of loan. 
As of March 31, 2024, all of the Bank’s customers in the JLG 
loans segment were female, with loans ranging between 
H6,000 and H1,00,000 for income generating activities.
Micro Banking Business Loans (MBBL)
With an objective to meet the increasing funding 
requirement of customers who have completed multiple 
loan cycles with the Bank, the Bank offers MBBL loans 
to its existing matured JLG borrowers. The Bank’s MBBL 
loan portfolio doubled, albeit on a smaller base, during 
FY 2023-24 to H671 crore, as of March 31, 2024. Given the 
Bank has long track record in JLG lending and has a large 
number of JLG borrowers, the Bank expects significant 
growth potential in MBBL lending which is also reflected 
in credit growth registered by the Bank in FY 2023-24. 
Furthermore, as the Bank provides MBBL loans only to 
its existing borrowers with good track record, the asset 
quality in MBBL loan segment remain very healthy with 
Gross NPAs of <1% as on March 31, 2024.

Healthy growth with healthy financial and cost-efficient operational performance
The Bank provides products and services in a cost-effective manner; USFBL’s cost-to-income ratio is one of the lowest 
among all SFB’s. The Bank’s cost-efficient operations can be attributed to clearly articulated business strategy, as well as 
branch structure, our track record expertise, automated and digitised processes. During the year under review, USFBL 
maintained healthy operational performance validated by a 18.96% year-on-year growth in operating profits (before

income ratio of 56.4% during FY2023-24.

credit assessment and risk management framework. The framework identifies, monitors and manages risks inherent in 
the operations, particularly in managing credit, market, liquidity, IT and operational risks. 
The Bank measures, monitors and implements risk parameters, including real-time monitoring of regulatory updates 
and trends in national and international markets; framing guidelines, policies and products in accordance with industry 
practices; defining admissible portfolio at risk for each product; and establishing an early warning system to provide 
signals for sector performance and limits on extending funds to a particular industry.

percentage of gross NPAs to Gross Advances was 2.51% while the percentage of net NPAs to Net Advances was 0.03% as 
on March 31, 2024. On the other hand, the Provision Coverage Ratio (PCR) was healthy at 98.92% as on March 31, 2024.

implement all strategic projects in a timebound manner while assessing progress with return on investment. The Bank

Capital raising through Initial Public Offering (IPO) in July 2023
The Bank had launched its Initial Public Offering (IPO) in July 2023 and raised equity capital of H500 crore by issuing 
20 crore equity shares at H25 per share (including securities premium of H15 per share). The Bank’s IPO was accepted 
well by the investors with overall subscription of 100 times. The IPO has enabled the Bank to meet one of the licensing 
conditions. As a result of IPO, promoter shareholding in the bank declined from 84.75% as on March 31, 2023 to 69.06% 
as on March 31, 2024. Capital raised through IPO coupled with accretion of profits resulted in increase of Capital plus 
reserves by 49% from H2,000 crore as on March 31, 2023 to H2,973 crore as on March 31, 2024.

Financial inclusion and priority sector lending
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has mandated a higher priority sector lending requirement for SFBs at 75% vs.  40% for 
universal banks. Owing to the Bank’s legacy of serving under-banked population of the country and promoting financial 
inclusion, USFBL meets priority sector lending requirements comfortably while monetising surplus PSL portfolio through 
sale of Priority Sector Lending Certificate (PSLCs) or sale of surplus PSL portfolio through IBPC or portfolio sell-down. 
On overall basis, after netting of PSLC sale / IBPC, the Bank’s PSL achievement (basis quarterly average) stood at 86.78% 
during FY 2023-24, against the regulatory minimum requirement of 75%. On account of higher proportion of PSL as 
compared to the requirement of the RBI, the Bank has been able to sell the surplus PSL portfolio through Priority Sector 
Lending Certificate (PSLCs) to earn non-interest income for the Bank. During FY2023-24, the Bank earned PSLC income 
of H103.65 crore. 
Furthermore, USFBL is comfortably placed on RBI’s norms for SFBs to maintain loans with ticket size of up to H25 lakh, 
to be not less than 50% of the Bank’s total loan portfolio. 
The Bank’s lending to the ticket size of less than H25 lakh was at 72.2% of the gross loan portfolio as on March 31, 2024.

OUTLOOK
The reported year has been an excellent year for the Bank in terms of financial performance. The Bank has reported 
highest ever annual operating profit (pre-provisions) of H997 crore in FY 2023-24. Not only the Bank’s loan portfolio and 
deposits registered healthy business growth, the Bank also witnessed improvement in asset quality. The Bank believes 
that there are significant growth opportunities available in the core operational geographies, owing to robust growth 
potential and relatively low financial penetration. USFBL aims to strengthen its franchise and improve its presence by 
exploring new geographies and offering relevant and suitable product offerings. While FY 2024-25 is expected to pose 
challenge with respect to elevated interest rate scenario and tighter liquidity environment, the Bank expects to maintain

by Utkarsh Core Invest Limited (formerly known as Utkarsh Micro Finance Limited) incorporated on April 30, 2016 under 
the provision of the Companies Act, 2013. The Bank is licensed by the Reserve Bank of India to operate as a Small 
Finance Bank under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 on November 25, 2016. As per the Business Transfer Agreement, 
the entire balance sheet of Utkarsh Micro Finance Ltd. (now known as Utkarsh Core Invest Limited) was transferred to

commenced on January 23, 2017, with the opening of five branches in Delhi, Patna, Nagpur, and Varanasi. The Bank has 
entered its 6th year of business operations. It was included in the second schedule of the RBI Act, 1934 vide notification 
dated November 16, 2017 and was accorded the status of a Scheduled Commercial Bank.
The Bank aims to provide affordable & accessible banking services which are process centric, technology enabled, 
and people oriented resulting in reliable, scalable and sustainable institution facilitating socioeconomic change. The 
purpose is to provide banking products to the unserved and underserved sections of the country, which includes small 
and marginal farmers, micro and small industries, and other organized sector entities, at an affordable cost. 
USFBL has prepared this disclosure document in compliance with the directions of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) vide its 
circular RBI/2015-16/58 DBR.No.BP.BC.1/21.06.201/2015-16 dated July 1, 2015. The document provides a review of key 
observations pertaining to the Bank’s capital adequacy, credit quality, key business highlights and a review of its key 
risks as of 31st Mar, 2024.
I.	
Disclosure Framework (DF) – 1: Scope of Application
	
The framework of disclosures applies to USFBL. The Bank does not have any subsidiary, nor does it have any interest 
in any insurance entity. All the information in this document is made as a standalone entity.
II.	
DF – 2: Capital Adequacy 
	
1)	
Qualitative Disclosure:
	
	
a)	
The Bank is subject to the capital adequacy framework as per the “Operating Guidelines for Small Finance 
Bank” from Reserve Bank of India (RBI). As per capital adequacy framework, the Bank is required to 
maintain a minimum Capital to Risk Weighted Assets (CRAR) of 15% with minimum Tier I capital as 
7.5%. As of now, capital conservation buffer and counter cyclical buffer are not applicable for Small 
Finance Banks (SFBs).
	
	
	
For the purpose of capital adequacy, only credit risk is covered since there is no separate capital charge 
prescribed for market risk and operational risk as per the direction of RBI. For computation of capital 
for credit risk of SFBs, RBI has prescribed Basel II Standardized Approach and has permitted the use of 
external rating-based risk weights for rated exposure and regulatory retail approach for small retail loans.
 
 
Credit Risk (Standardized Approach) 
 
 
Market Risk (Standardized Approach) 
 
 
Operational Risk (Basic Indicator Approach) 
	
	
	
For better assessment of the capital, the Bank is having Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process 
(ICAAP) with Simplified Approach, considering its nature, scope, geographic spread, complexity, and 
quantum of operations. Our risk management practices are in line with the required degree of supervision 
for a Small Finance Bank.
	
	
	
The Bank’s ICAAP focuses to ensure that the Bank has sufficient capital to support all the risks inherent to 
its business and an adequate capital buffer based on the business profile to cover future unforeseen risks 
upto a certain degree. The change in the level of credit risk, market risk and interest rate risk along with 
the changes in on- balance sheet and off- balance sheet exposures are assessed under different stress 
scenarios by the Bank to have better assessment of the capital requirement.

V.	 DF – 5: Credit Risk Mitigation: Disclosures for Standardized Approach 
	
1)	
Qualitative Disclosure: 
	
	
Borrower’s financial strength and debt-servicing capacity shall be the primary consideration while granting 
credits and bank shall not rely, solely on collateral or guarantees as the primary source of repayment or as a 
substitute for evaluating the borrower’s creditworthiness. Nevertheless, collateral and guarantees, if properly 
taken and managed, serve a few important functions in credit risk management. These include:
 
 
to mitigate credit risk by providing the bank with a secondary source of repayment if the borrower defaults 
on a credit facility.
 
 
to gain control of the collateral which is the primary source of repayment of a facility in default. 
 
 
to provide early warning of a borrower's deteriorating repayment ability (particularly for credit facilities 
such as margin financing where top-up of collateral may be required from time to time); and
 
 
to enable bank to provide lower capital to credits which are secured by eligible collateral or guarantees. 
	
	
Assets or rights provided to the Bank by the counterparty or a third party to secure a credit facility. The Bank 
must have a priority claim on the sale proceeds of collateralized assets or rights in the case of default of 
the counterparty or in case of occurrence of other credit events specified in the related facility documents 
collateral includes both primary and secondary securities provided to the Bank.
	
	
Primary security: Primary security is the asset created out of the credit facility extended to the borrower 
and / or which are directly associated with the business / project of the borrower for which the credit facility 
has been extended.
	
	
Secondary security: Secondary security is any other security offered for the said credit facility. For example, 
mortgage of House, land, Fixed deposits, Gold etc.
	
	
Depending on the deal structure and overall assessment of borrower, the personal guarantee of promoter 
directors / partners / proprietor / property owners, etc. is taken in Wholesale Banking vertical on a case - 
to - case basis.
	
	
The credit documentation empowers the bank to apply the collateral freely to discharge the borrower's 
obligations in so far as they are not discharged by the borrower in accordance with the loan agreement (e.g., 
due to breach of repayment terms, liquidation, or bankruptcy of the borrower). The bank verifies the existence 
and ownership of the assets being pledged before acceptance and ensures that there is no prior claim, or 
claim of equal ranking, by another party on the collateral. The bank secures its control of the collateral prior 
to the drawdown of credit facilities e.g., it obtains customers’ authorization to transfer the legal title to the 
pledged shares to the bank etc. Where there is a need for the collateral to be held by a third party, the bank 
obtains that party’s written confirmation that it has no claim over the collateral. Charges on collateral are 
registered promptly with the relevant authorities under applicable law (e.g., registrar of companies – ROC, 
CERSAI), where appropriate.
	
	
Valuations are based on the current market value of the collateral and are not biased to enable the bank, 
to grant a higher credit limit to the borrower or improve its internal credit rating, make a smaller amount 
of provision, or continue interest accrual for a problem credit. The bank ensures that the valuation method 
used, whether internal or external, is based on assumptions that are both reasonable and prudent and all 
assumptions should be clearly documented. 
	
	
Collateral are being revalued on a regular basis, though the frequency may vary with the type of collateral 
involved and the nature & the internal credit rating of the underlying credit e.g., frequency for shares and 
properties as collateral would be different. Staff conducting internal valuations, carrying out site visits to 
collateralized properties or deciding on the use of external valuers etc. shall be independent of the marketing 
or credit granting & approval function. The bank monitors general trends in markets (e.g., property price and 
stock indices) for the major types of collateral taken. It conducts stress tests & scenario analysis on their portfolio 
of collateral to assess the impact under unusual market conditions (e.g., a significant decline in property 
or stock prices).
	
	
Authority and responsibility are clearly delegated to relevant individuals and departments for approving 
the acceptance, monitoring or safe custody of collaterals and guarantees. The bank ensures safe custody, 
easy retrieval, control over movement, control over access, of collateral & guarantees depending upon their

nature & types e.g., use of fireproof vault etc. Collaterals & guarantees are being handled as per the bank’s 
internal procedures.
	
	
Bank periodically verify the availability of collateral though inspection and audit. Prior to the release of collateral 
or guarantees, bank shall ensure that:
 
 
all conditions for release stipulated in the relevant loan agreements have been fully complied with; and
 
 
the release has been duly authorized.
	
	
All the collateral acquired by the bank during the satisfaction of debts due to it will be disposed of at the 
earliest suitable opportunity.  Disposal of collateral will be at arm’s length and through a transparent process 
(such as a public auction or independent estate agents for foreclosed properties etc.) to avoid complaints / 
disputes by the original owner. The bank will ensure that the disposal of collateral complies with relevant laws 
and regulations and where appropriate, legal advice should be sought.
	
	
Management information on collateral has been produced periodically to facilitate review by the senior 
management. The information required will depend on the nature and value of collateral taken by the bank. 
Following information can be included (inclusive):
 
 
Breakdown of credit exposure by type of collateral
 
 
Borrowings exceeding maximum loan to- value ratio.
 
 
Total current market value of assets foreclosed during satisfaction of debts.
 
 
Comparison of latest assessed market value with actual proceeds of collateral sold.
 
 
Current market value of collateral related to each classified credit.
	
	
Risk concentrations are the single most important cause of major problems in banks and may take many 
forms including exposures to types of assets, individual counterparties, groups of related counterparties and 
counterparties in specific geographical locations, economic or industry sectors, 
	
	
The following exposures shall be included while monitoring geographical concentration of exposures:
 
 
Sanction limit or outstanding limit
 
 
Sanction limit but not disbursed; and
 
 
Agreement in principle
	
	
Geographical concentration risk has been monitored by the RMD based on region / zone in which the loan is 
booked. Bank endeavors to gradually reduce the geographical concentration to ensure that any unfavorable 
event in any region is not significantly affecting the bank’s portfolio. The concentration of the top two states 
shall not exceed 50% of the total portfolio by the year 2024. Concentration of any other state shall not exceed 
15% of the portfolio. Similarly, portfolio concentration for single district shall not exceed 4% of the portfolio by 
year 2024. If certain level of concentration is unavoidable due to the Bank’s trade area, geographic location, 
lack of access to diverse borrowers, Bank’s own expertise in a particular industry or economic sector, in such 
cases, the Bank shall monitor the performance of such portfolio very closely to take appropriate steps in case 
of any red flags.
	
	
The Bank complies with the statutory exposure limits set by RBI for individual counterparties, group of 
counterparties, geography / region, industry / sector etc. The Bank has established internal exposure limits that 
may be more conservative than the statutory limits stipulated by RBI, commensurate with capital base and 
balance sheet size.  Appropriate justification shall be recorded for enhancement of such limits. The Bank shall 
carry out analysis of the credit portfolio, including estimates of its trends and use results in setting internal 
limits. Aggregate exposure in NBFC should not be more than 10% of the credit exposure of the Bank as per 
the last quarter balance sheet. Factors like the perceived risk of a certain sector or region, the nature of the 
product, maturity/tenor, and purpose of credit and sources of payment may also be considered while fixing 
internal exposure limits.

1)	
Qualitative disclosures:
	
	
Market Risk may be defined as the possibility of loss to a bank caused by changes in the market variables 
such as interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices, etc. The market risk for the Bank is governed by ‘Market 
Risk Management Policy’ and ‘Treasury & Investment Policy’, which are approved by the Board. These policies 
ensure that transactions in debt and capital markets are conducted in accordance with acceptable business 
practices and are as per the extant regulatory guidelines. 
	
	
a)	
Structure and Organization
	
	
	
The organizational structure for Market Risk Management is as follows:
 
 
Board of Directors
 
 
Risk Management Committee of Board (RMCB)
 
 
Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO)
 
 
Chief Risk Officer (CRO)
 
 
Head - Market Risk Department
 
 
Market Risk Management Unit
	
	
	
The Market Risk Management unit is independent of the dealing and settlement functions and reports 
directly to the Chief Risk Officer. 
	
	
b)	
Strategies and Processes
	
	
	
Risk identification entails ensuring all instruments that result in Market Risk both on-balance sheet and 
off- balance sheet of the Bank is identified and monitored centrally. To achieve this objective, all new 
instruments/ products in which the Bank engages should be assessed. The Asset Liability Management 
Committee (ALCO) reviews all new instruments to evaluate whether they result in market risk. Modifications 
to existing instruments are reported to the ALCO to enable such evaluation.
	
	
	
The Market Risk Division of the Risk Management Department is responsible for the design and 
implementation of the Bank’s market risk management/ALM system. The Division is independent from 
business and trading units, and provides an independent risk assessment, which is critical to the ALCO’s 
key function of controlling and managing market risks in accordance with the mandate established by 
the Board and Risk Management Committee. Mid Office of the Bank’s Treasury function is attached to 
the Market Risk Division of Risk Management Department. Mid Office prepares and analyses daily reports 
on various activities of the Bank’s Treasury. The Mid Office, which is responsible for the critical functions of 
independent market risk monitoring, measurement and analysis, reports to the Bank's Chief Risk Officer 
through the Head of Market Risk Division.
	
	
c)	
Market Risk Measurement
	
	
	
Adverse movements in interest rates can affect both interest earnings and the fair or economic value 
of the financial instruments. The very nature of the financial intermediation business makes the Bank 
susceptible to interest rate risk and unmanaged risk could potentially pose a significant threat to the 
Bank’s earnings and capital. Interest rate risk results from both the trading book and banking book. The

impact of interest rate risk on trading book is actively measured using trading book risk metrics like PV01, 
duration, etc. For the banking book, interest rate risk arises through mismatches in re-pricing of interest 
rate sensitive assets (RSA), rate sensitive liabilities (RSL) and rate sensitive off-balance sheet items.
	
	
	
For SFBs, Reserve Bank of India has not prescribed capital charge for market risk. Since the market risk 
framework also covers specific risk charge, therefore, to assess the credit risk in the trading book, an external 
rating-based approach is used, and risk weighted assets so computed are included under credit risk.

VIII.	DF – 8: Operational Risk – 
	
1)	
Qualitative disclosures:
	
	
Operational Risk is defined as the risk of losses resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, 
and systems or from external events, which includes but is not limited to legal risk. It is inherent in all activities 
arising out of a bank’s business and operations and could result in financial losses, litigation, regulatory fines, 
or other damage to the bank. The severity of impact on the bank, its employees and customers are dependent 
on the efficacy with which operational risk is managed by the bank. The goal is to keep operational risk at 
appropriate levels, considering the bank’s financial strength, the characteristics of its businesses, the markets 
in which it operates, and the competitive and regulatory environment in which it operates.
	
	
a.	
Structure and Organization
	
	
	
The operational risk management governance structure is as follows:
 
 
Board of Directors
 
 
Risk Management Committee of Board (RMCB)
 
 
Operational Risk Management Committee (ORMC)
 
 
Chief Risk Officer (CRO)
 
 
Head - Operational Risk Department
 
 
Operational Risk Unit
	
	
	
Additionally, with a view to ensuring sound practices in respect of governance of the overall Operational 
Risk, the Bank has outlined policies and processes in respect of Information Security, Business Continuity 
Planning, Disaster Recovery, Fraud Risk Management Control and Customer Services.
	
	
b.	
Strategies and Processes
	
	
	
The business units and supporting operational functions are accountable for operational risks and controls 
in their respective areas, which they manage as per the policies, standards, processes, procedures; and 
operational risk management framework laid down by the independent operation risk management 
(ORM) function.
	
	
	
ORM along with product and process managers facilitates the business and operation groups for carrying 
out risk and control self-assessments on a periodic basis. All the new products and processes including 
modifications thereof are reviewed by the control groups such as risk, compliance, legal and audit.
	
	
	
Bank has an internal framework for reporting and capturing operational risk incidents. Significant incidents 
reported are investigated to assess weaknesses in controls and identify areas for improvement.
	
	
	
The Bank also has a Whistle blower policy, which is open to employees and vendors for raising their 
concerns, with full confidentiality, on any fraud, malpractice or any other untoward activity or event. The 
Bank has a separate Risk Containment Unit (RCU) to pre-empt and weed out undesirable prospective 
customers at the on-boarding stage itself. The Bank also has Fraud Risk Management Unit to detect and 
90
prevent frauds as also address fraud risk related issues and conduct investigations wherever frauds have 
been detected or potential frauds are flagged.
	
	
	
There is an independent information security group, which addresses information and cyber security 
related risks. The function is governed by a Board approved policies on information security and cyber 
security. The Bank carries out periodical awareness exercise to ensure that employees are updated on 
information security practices. The information security function is driven by both technology and process 
driven controls.
	
	
	
Disaster recovery and Business Continuity Plan (BCP) has also been established by the Bank for significant 
businesses to ensure continuity of operations and minimal disruption to customer services. These plans 
are periodically tested and reviewed to ensure their effectiveness.
IX.	 DF – 9: Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB)
	
1)	
Qualitative Disclosure
	
	
Interest rate risk is the risk where changes in market interest rates might adversely affect a bank's financial 
condition. The immediate impact of changes in interest rates is on bank's earnings through changes in its Net 
Interest Income (NII). A long-term impact of changes in interest rates is on bank's Market Value of Equity (MVE) 
or Net worth through changes in the economic value of its, liabilities and off-balance sheet positions. The 
interest rate risk, when viewed from these two perspectives, is known as 'earnings perspective' and 'economic 
value' perspective, respectively.
	
	
The interest rate risk is measured and monitored through two approaches:
	
	
Earning at Risk (EAR): Earnings perspective involves analysing the impact of changes in interest rates on 
accrual or reported earnings in the near term. This is measured using TGA whose focus is to measure the level 
of a bank’s exposure to interest rate risk in terms of sensitivity of its NII to interest rate movements over the 
horizon of analysis which is usually one year. It involves bucketing of all RSA and RSL and off - balance sheet 
items as per residual maturity/ re-pricing date in various time bands and compute Earnings at Risk (EaR) i.e. 
loss of income under different interest rate scenarios over a time horizon of one year.
	
	
Market Value of Equity (MVE): This approach analyses the dynamic behaviour of economic value of equity 
with response to varying interest rate scenarios. Broadly, the MVE is defined as the difference between the 
market value of assets and market value of liability in response to a change in the interest rate. The linkage 
between the two is established via modified duration of rate sensitive assets and liabilities.
	
	
The Duration Gap Analysis (DGA) would involve bucketing of all on- and off- balance sheet Risk Sensitive Assets 
(RSA) and Risk Sensitive Liabilities (RSL) as per their residual maturity / re-pricing dates in various time bands 
and computing the Modified Duration Gap (MDG). MDG would be used to evaluate the impact on the Market 
Value of Equity (MVE) of the bank under different interest rate scenarios. 
	
	
Modified Duration of an asset or liability measures the approximate percentage change in its value for a 100 
basis point change in the rate of interest.

of ethics is a statement of the Bank’s commitment to integrity and the highest standards of ethical practices. It 
defines the standards of conduct that is expected of all employees in order that the right decisions are taken in 
performing their roles and responsibilities across various functions in the Bank. The code of ethics is intended 
to be the charter for day-to-day work, to enable employees to make the right decisions and, therefore, serves to 
(1) underline the fundamental commitment to compliance with regulatory guidelines and laws of the land, (2) 
set forth basic parameters of ethical and acceptable social behaviour, and (3) establish a system for detection 
and reporting of known or suspected ethical or violations of regulations. During the fiscal 2024,the Bank has not 
entered into any materially significant transactions with its directors or relatives of the directors, which could lead

ordinary course of its business. All the members of the Board of Directors of the Bank have affirmed compliance 
with the said codes as applicable to them for fiscal 2024.

a. 	 Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)
Yes, As an institution providing financial services, the Bank’s operations are not material resource intensive. 
Thus, sustainable sourcing of raw materials may not be a significant material issue for the banking sector in 
general. However, as a responsible corporate citizen, the Bank has been focusing on maximising its resource 
consumption efficiency, reducing waste generation while focusing on improving its process efficiency and 
productivity. Even as digitization of products and services has been reducing the requirement of paper, it 
remains a significant resource consumed during the Bank’s normal course of business, and it has focused on 
reducing its paper consumption further by adopting digitalization, and rationalizing printing requirements 
internally within the business. For procurement of equipment that are required to run our banking operations, 
such as computer hardware, lighting devices, air conditioners and DG sets, the Bank ensures that energy 
efficiency standards are duly considered during the purchase of such equipment. The Bank also has a Supplier 
Code of Conduct outlining its expectations from vendors to adopt the sustainable practices

Independent Auditors’ Report
To The Members of UTKARSH SMALL FINANCE BANK LIMITED
Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of UTKARSH SMALL FINANCE BANK LIMITED (the “Bank”), 
which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2024, Profit and Loss Account, the Cash Flow Statement for the year 
then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information. 
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid  financial 
statements give the information required by the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) 
in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the Accounting Standards prescribed under 
section 133 of the Act (“Accounting Standards”) as applicable to bank , the relevant circulars, guidelines and directions 
issued by the Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) from time to time  and other accounting principles generally accepted in 
India, of the state of affairs of the Bank as at March  31, 2024, its profit and its cash flows for the year ended on that date. 
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of the financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified 
under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor’s 
Responsibility for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Bank in 
accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) together with the 
ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the 
Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements 
and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us is sufficient and appropriate to provide 
a basis for our audit opinion on the financial statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the 
financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. 
We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.

Key Audit Matter
Auditor’s Response

Identification of Non-Performing Advances and 
Provisioning for Advances
(Refer Schedule 9 read with Note 18.4 to the financial 
statements)
Advances constitute a significant portion of the Bank’s 
assets and the quality of these advances is measured 
in terms of ratio of Non-Performing Advances (“NPA”) 
to the gross advances of the Bank. The Bank has net 
advances amounting to H 16,36,481 Lakh as at March 
31, 2024. 
Advances constitute a significant portion of the Bank’s 
assets, and the quality of these advances is measured 
in terms of ratio of Non-Performing Advances (“NPA”) 
to the gross advances of the Bank. The Bank has 
gross advances amounting to H 16,62,928 Lakh 
(Previous Year H 13,35,711 Lakh) and the gross NPA 
ratio of Bank is 2.51 % (Previous Year 3.23%) as at 
March 31, 2024.
Our audit approach included testing the design, operating 
effectiveness of internal controls and substantive audit 
procedures in respect of income recognition, asset 
classification and provisioning. In particular:
 
 
We have evaluated and understood the Bank’s internal 
control system in adhering to the RBI guidelines;
 
 
We have analysed and understood key IT systems/ 
applications used and tested the design and 
implementation as well as operational effectiveness 
of relevant controls in relation to income recognition, 
asset classification, viz., standard, sub-standard, 
doubtful and loss with reference to RBI guidelines 
and provisioning pertaining to advances;

Key Audit Matter
Auditor’s Response
The Reserve Bank of India’s (‘RBI’) guidelines on income 
recognition, asset classification and provisioning 
(‘IRAC norms’) and other RBI guidelines (herein after 
referred as “RBI guidelines”) prescribes the norms 
for identification and classification of NPAs and the 
minimum provision required for such assets.
The Bank is also required to apply its judgement to 
determine the identification and provisioning for NPAs 
by applying quantitative as well as qualitative factors. 
Since the identification of NPAs and provisioning for 
advances is significant to the overall audit, we have 
ascertained this as a key audit matter.
 
 
We test checked advances to examine the validity 
and accuracy of the recorded amounts, impairment 
provision for NPAs, and compliance with IRAC norms 
and other RBI Guidelines.

Key Information technology (IT) systems used in 
financial reporting process:
As a Scheduled Commercial Bank that operates on 
core banking solution (“CBS”) and other applications 
across its branches, the reliability and security of IT 
systems plays a key role in the business operations. 
Since large volume of transactions are processed 
daily, the IT controls are required to ensure that 
applications process data as expected and that 
changes are made in an appropriate manner. 
The IT infrastructure is critical for smooth functioning 
of the Bank’s business operations as well as for timely 
and accurate financial accounting and reporting. 
Due to the pervasive nature and complexity of the 
IT environment we have ascertained Key Information 
technology (“IT”) systems used in financial reporting 
process as a key audit matter. 
We involved our IT specialists to obtain an understanding 
of the Bank’s IT related control environment. Furthermore, 
we conducted an assessment and identified key IT 
applications, databases and operating systems that 
are relevant for our audit. For the key IT systems used 
to prepare accounting and financial information, our 
areas of audit focus included access security (including 
controls over privileged access), program change controls, 
database management and network operations. In 
particular, our procedures include:
 
 
We obtained an understanding of the Bank’s IT 
control environment and key changes during the 
audit period that may be relevant to the audit;
 
 
We 
tested 
the 
design, 
implementation 
and 
operating effectiveness of the Bank’s General IT 
controls over the key IT systems that are critical 
to financial reporting. This included evaluation of 
Bank’s controls to evaluate segregation of duties and 
access rights being provisioned / modified based on 
duly approved requests, access for exit cases being 
revoked in a timely manner and access of all users 
being recertified during the period of audit;
 
 
We also tested key automated and manual 
business cycle controls and logic for system 
generated reports relevant to the audit; including 
testing of compensating controls or performed 
alternate procedures.
Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon
 
 
The Bank’s Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the other information. The other information 
comprises the Chairman’s Statement, the Directors Report including annexures to the Directors report included in 
the Annual Report but does not include the financial statements and our auditors report thereon and the Basel II 
Disclosures under New Capital Adequacy Framework (Basel II Disclosures).
 
 
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and Basel II Disclosures and we do 
not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
 
 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, 
in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our 
knowledge obtained during the course of our audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
204
 
 
If, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this 
auditor’s report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to 
report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial 
Statements	
	
The Bank’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the 
preparation of these financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance 
and cash flows of the Bank in accordance with the provisions of Section 29 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, 
Accounting Standards and other accounting principles generally accepted in India and the circulars, guidelines and 
the directions issued by RBI, from time to time. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting 
records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Bank and for preventing and 
detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments 
and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal 
financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, 
relevant to the preparation and presentation of the financial statement that give a true and fair view and are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Bank’s ability to continue as 
a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Bank or to cease operations, or has no realistic 
alternative but to do so. 
The Bank’s Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Bank’s financial reporting process. 
Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with 
SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:
 
 
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, 
design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from 
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
 
 
Obtain an understanding of internal financial control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that 
are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our 
opinion on whether the Bank has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in 
place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
 
 
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and 
related disclosures made by the management.
 
 
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on 
the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast 
significant doubt on the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty 
exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements 
or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence 
obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Bank to cease 
to continue as a going concern.
 
 
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and 
whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves 
fair presentation.

Financial Statement
Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the financial statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes it 
probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the financial statements may be influenced. 
We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating 
the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the financial statements.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing 
of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify 
during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may 
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We 
describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter 
or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report 
because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits 
of such communication.

Beneficiaries”) or provide any guarantee, security or the like on behalf of the Ultimate Beneficiaries.
	
	
	
(c)	
Based on the audit procedures performed that have been considered reasonable and appropriate 
in the circumstances, nothing has come to our notice that has caused us to believe that the 
representations under sub-clause (i) and (ii) of Rule 11(e), as provided under (a) and (b) above, contain 
any material misstatement.
	
	
v.	
As stated in note 18.1.1 to the financial statements, the Board of Directors of the Bank has proposed final 
dividend for the year which is subject to the approval of the members at the ensuing Annual General 
Meeting. The dividend proposed is in accordance with section 123 of the Act, as applicable.
	
	
vi.	
Based on our examination, which included test checks, the Bank has used accounting softwares for 
maintaining its books of account for the financial year ended March 31, 2024 which has a feature of 
recording audit trail (edit log) facility and the same has operated throughout the year for all relevant 
transactions recorded in the softwares. Further, during the course of our audit we did not come across any 
instance of the audit trail feature being tampered with.
	
	
vii.	
As proviso to Rule 3(1) of the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014 is applicable from April 1, 2023, however, 
reporting under Rule 11 (g) of the Companies (Audit and Auditors) Rules, 2014 on preservation of audit 
trail as per the statutory requirements for record retention is not applicable for the financial year ended 
March 31, 2024.
2.	
We report that during the course of our audit we have visited and performed select relevant procedures at 43 
branches. Since the Bank considers its key operations to be automated, with the key applications largely integrated 
to the Core Banking System, it does not require its branches to submit any financial returns. Accordingly, our audit 
is carried out centrally at Head Office based on the records and data required for the purpose of Audit being made 
available to us.

Annexure “A” to the Independent Auditor’s Report
(Referred to in paragraph 1(h) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report 
of even date)
Report on the Internal Financial Controls with reference to Financial Statements under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 
of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)
We have audited the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements of UTKARSH SMALL FINANCE 
BANK LIMITED (the “Bank”) as of March 31, 2024 in conjunction with our audit of the financial statements of the Bank 
for the year ended on that date.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls
The Bank’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal 
control over financial reporting criteria established by the Bank considering the essential components of internal control 
stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute 
of Chartered Accountants of India. These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of 
adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its 
business, including adherence to Bank’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds 
and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial 
information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013, the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and the guidelines issued 
by the Reserve Bank of India. 
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements of 
the Bank based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal 
Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants 
of India and the Standards on Auditing prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, to the extent 
applicable to an audit of internal financial controls. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with 
ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal 
financial controls over financial reporting was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in 
all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over 
financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating 
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. the procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, 
including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinion on the Bank’s internal financial controls system over financial reporting.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to financial statements
A Bank's internal financial control with reference to financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable 
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external 
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A Bank's internal financial control with reference 
to financial statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in 
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Bank; (2) provide 
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Bank are being 
made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the Bank; and (3) provide reasonable 
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the Bank's assets 
that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
208
Inherent Limitations of internal financial control with reference to financial statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial control with reference to financial statements, including the 
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may 
occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting to 
future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control over financial reporting may become inadequate 
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion, to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us the Bank has, in all material 
respects, an adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements and such internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements were operating effectively as at March 31, 2024, based on the criteria 
for internal financial control over financial reporting established by the Bank considering the essential components of 
internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by 
the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.

Advances 
	
a)	
Accounting and Classification
	
	
Advances are classified as performing and non-performing (NPA) as per RBI guidelines. Restructured assets are 
classified and provided for in accordance with the guidelines issued by the RBI from time to time.
	
	
The Bank considers a restructured account as one where the Bank, for economic or legal reasons relating to the 
borrower’s financial difficulty, grants to the borrower concessions that the Bank would not otherwise consider. 
Restructuring would normally involve modification of terms of the advances / securities, which would generally 
include, among others, alteration of repayment period / repayable amount / the amount of instalments / 
rate of interest (due to reasons other than competitive reasons). Restructured accounts are classified as such 
by the Bank only upon approval and implementation of the restructuring package. Necessary provision for 
diminution in the fair value of a restructured account is made and classification thereof is as per the extant 
RBI guidelines. The asset classification and necessary provisions thereon are done in accordance with the said 
RBI guidelines.
	
b)	
Inter Bank Participation Certificates
	
	
The Bank enters into Inter Bank Participation Certificate with Risk Sharing as issuing Bank and the aggregate 
amount of participation are reduced from the aggregate loan outstanding.
	
c)	
Provisioning
	
	
Provisions in respect of non-performing and restructured advances are made based on management’s 
assessment of the degree of impairment of the advances subject to the minimum provisioning levels prescribed 
under RBI guidelines with regard to the Prudential Norms on Income Recognition, Asset Classification & 
Provisioning prescribed from time to time.
	
	
The Bank also maintains provision on standard assets to cover potential credit losses which are inherent in 
any loan portfolio in accordance with RBI guidelines. However, provisioning rates prescribed by RBI are the 
regulatory minimum, and Bank made additional provisions in respect of advances to stressed sectors of the 
economy as approved by the Board from time to time. Provision made against standard assets is included in 
‘Other Liabilities and Provisions’.
	
	
Loans reported as fraud are classified appropriately as per relevant RBI guidelines and fully provided for 
immediately without considering the value of security.
	
d)	
Floating Provision
	
	
The Bank recognises floating provision as per the Board approved policy, which is in addition to the specific, 
contingent and general provisions made by the Bank. The floating provision will be utilised, with the approval 
of Board and RBI, in case of contingencies which do not arise in the normal course of business and are 
exceptional and non-recurring in nature and for making specific provision for impaired loans as per the 
requirement of extant RBI guidelines or any regulatory guidance / instructions. Floating provisions are netted 
off for NNPA Ratio and is included in ‘Other Liabilities and Provisions’.
C	
Investments
	
Classification and valuation of Bank’s Investments is carried out in accordance with relevant RBI guidelines/
directions and Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives Association (‘FIMMDA’) and Financial Benchmark India 
Private Limited (‘FBIL’) guidelines prescribed in this regard from time to time.
	
a)	
Classification
	
	
Investments are classified into ‘Held for Trading’ (‘HFT’), ‘Available for Sale’ (‘AFS’) and ‘Held to Maturity’ (HTM) 
categories at the time of purchase.
	
	
Investments that are acquired with an intention to hold till maturity are classified as “HTM”. 
	
	
Investments that are held primarily for sale within 90 days from the date of purchase are classified as “HFT”.

general ledger account transactions are valued as per the price list of RBI or prices declared by Primary Dealers

/ mark-up rates (reflecting associate credit risk) declared by the FIMMDA / FBIL are considered.
	
	
Quoted Mutual Fund units are valued as per stock exchange quotes and un-quoted mutual fund units are 
valued at last available re-purchase price or Net Asset Value where re-purchase price is not available.
	
c)	
Disposal of investments
	
	
Profit / Loss on sale of investments under the aforesaid three categories is recognized in the Profit and Loss 
account. Cost of investments is based on the weighted average cost method. The profit from sale of investment 
under HTM category, net of taxes and transfer to statutory reserve is appropriated from Profit and Loss account 
to “Capital Reserve” in accordance with the RBI Guidelines.
	
d)	
Transfer between categories
	
	
Transfer of investments between categories is accounted in accordance with the extant RBI guidelines:
	
	
a)	
Transfer from AFS/HFT to HTM is made at the lower of book value or market value at the time of transfer.
	
	
b)	
Transfer from HTM to AFS/HFT is made at acquisition price/ amortised cost if originally placed in HTM at 
par or at a discount and at amortised cost if originally placed in HTM at a premium.
	
	
c)	
Transfer from AFS to HFT category or vice-versa is made at book value and the provision for the 
accumulated depreciation, if any, held is transferred to the provisions for depreciation against the HFT 
securities or vice-versa.
	
e)	
Repurchase and Reverse repurchase transactions
	
	
Repurchase (‘Repo’) and reverse repurchase (‘Reverse Repo’) transactions including liquidity adjustment facility 
(with RBI) are accounted for as borrowing and lending transactions respectively. Accordingly, securities given 
as collateral under an agreement to repurchase them continue to be held under the investment account 
of the Bank and the Bank would continue to accrue the coupon/discount on the security during the repo 
period. The Bank continues to value the securities sold under repo as per the investment classification of the 
security. Borrowing cost on repo transactions is accounted for as interest expense and income on reverse repo 
transactions are accounted for as interest income.
	
f)	
Broken period interest, brokerage etc.
	
	
Broken period interest and costs such as brokerage paid at the time of acquisition of the investments are 
charged to the Profit and Loss account.
222
	
g)	
Investment Fluctuation Reserve.
	
	
Out of net profits earned during the year, transfer is made to Investment Fluctuation Reserve, for an amount 
not less than the lower of the (a) net profit on sale of investments during the year (b) net profit for the year less 
mandatory appropriations, till the balance in such Investment Fluctuation Reserve reaches a level of at least 
2% of the aggregate HFT and AFS portfolio. Draw down from the Investment Fluctuation Reserve has been 
made in accordance with the applicable RBI guidelines.
D	
Fixed assets and depreciation / amortisation
	
Tangible assets
	
Tangible fixed assets are accounted for at cost less accumulated depreciation, amortization and accumulated 
impairment losses. Cost includes freight, duties, taxes and all other directly attributable expenditures towards 
acquisition and installation of assets before it is ready for commercial use. Subsequent expenditure incurred on 
assets put to use is capitalised only when it increases the future benefit / functioning capability from / of such assets.
	
Tangible fixed assets under construction and tangible fixed assets acquired but not ready for their intended use will 
be disclosed as capital work-in-progress.
	
Capital work in progress includes cost of fixed assets that are not ready for their intended use and also includes 
advances paid to acquire fixed assets.
	
Depreciation is provided as per straight-line method from the date of addition over the estimated useful life of 
the asset. For assets purchased/ sold during the year, depreciation is being provided on pro rata basis by the Bank. 
Depreciation on assets sold during the year is charged to the Profit and Loss account up to the date of sale. Assets 
costing less than H5,000 are fully depreciated in the year of purchase. If the management’s estimate of the useful 
life of a fixed asset at the time of acquisition of the asset or of the remaining useful life on a subsequent review 
is shorter, then the depreciation is provided at a higher rate based on management’s estimate of the useful life/
remaining useful life. The management believes that depreciation rates currently used, fairly reflect its estimate of 
the useful lives and residual values of fixed assets which are in accordance with lives prescribed under Schedule II 
of Companies Act, 2013.
	
Leasehold improvements are amortised on straight line basis over the primary period of the lease or the estimated 
useful life of the assets, whichever is lower.
	
Losses arising from retirement or gains or losses arising from disposal of fixed assets which are carried at cost are 
recognized in the Profit and Loss account.
	
Intangible assets
	
Intangible assets that are acquired by the Bank are measured initially at cost. The cost of an intangible asset comprises its 
purchase price including after deducting trade discounts and rebates, any directly attributable cost of bringing the item to 
its working condition for its intended use following initial recognition. After initial recognition, an intangible asset is carried 
at its cost less any accumulated amortization and any accumulated impairment loss. Subsequent expenditure is capitalized 
only when it increases the future economic benefits from the specific asset to which it relates.
	
Intangible assets are amortized in the Profit and Loss account over their estimated useful lives from the date they are 
available for use based on the expected pattern of consumption of economic benefits of the asset. Intangible assets are 
amortized on straight line basis. Computer software are amortized on straight line basis over their estimated useful life of 
three years.For assets purchased/ sold during the year, amortisation is being provided on pro rata basis by the Bank.
	
Impairment of Assets
	
In accordance with Accounting Standard 28- Impairment of assets, the Bank assesses at each balance sheet date 
whether there is any indication of impairment of assets based on internal / external factor If any such indication 
exists, the Bank estimates the recoverable amount of the asset. If such recoverable amount of the asset or the 
recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs to is less than its carrying amount, the 
carrying amount will be reduced to its recoverable amount. The reduction is treated as an impairment loss and 
is recognized in the Profit and Loss account. If at the balance sheet date there is an indication that a previously 
assessed impairment loss no longer exists, the recoverable amount is reassessed and the asset is reflected at the 
recoverable amount subject to a maximum of depreciable historical cost. Depreciation is provided on the revised 
carrying amount of the asset over its remaining useful life.

on which the derivative contracts are entered into and are re-measured at fair value as at the Balance Sheet or 
reporting dates. 
	
Derivatives are classified as assets when the fair value is positive (positive marked to market value) or as liabilities 
when the fair value is negative (negative marked to market value). Changes in the fair value of derivatives other than 
those designated as hedges are recognised in the Profit and Loss account. 
	
Derivative contracts designated as hedges are not marked to market unless their underlying transaction is marked 
to market. In respect of derivative contracts that are marked to market, changes in the market value are recognised 
in the Profit and Loss account in the relevant period.	
	
The Bank identifies the hedged item (asset or liability) at the inception of the transaction itself. Hedge effectiveness 
is ascertained at the time of the inception of the hedge and periodically thereafter. Gains or losses arising from 
hedge ineffectiveness, if any, are recognised in the Profit and Loss account. Contingent liabilities on account of 
derivative contracts denominated in foreign currencies are reported at closing rates of exchange notified by FEDAI 
as at the balance sheet date.
G	
Employee benefits
	
a.	
Defined Contribution Plan –

the Bank acquires substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership are classified as finance leases. 
Finance lease is capitalised at the commencement of the lease at an amount equal to lower of its fair value and 
present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and 
reduction of lease liability so as to achieve constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. The 
rental obligations, net of finance charges, are reflected as borrowings. Finance charges are recognised as finance 
costs in the profit and loss account.
	
Leases where the lessor effectively retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership over the lease term 
are classified as operating leases. Operating lease rentals are recognised as and when the payments are made over 
the lease terms.
K	
Taxation
	
Income tax comprises the current tax (i.e. amount of tax for the period, determined in accordance with the Income 
Tax Act, 1961 and the rules framed there under) and the net change in the deferred tax asset or liability for the period 
(reflecting the tax effects of timing differences between accounting income and taxable income for the period).
	
Provision for current income-tax is recognized in accordance with the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961 and 
is made annually based on the tax liability after taking credit for tax allowances and exemptions.
	
The current tax, deferred tax charge or credit and the corresponding deferred tax liability or asset is 
recognised using the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent there is reasonable certainty that the assets can be realized in 
future. However, where there is unabsorbed depreciation or carried forward loss under taxation laws, deferred tax 
assets are recognised only if there is virtual certainty (supported by convincing evidence of future taxable income) 
of realization of such assets. 
	
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and appropriately adjusted to reflect the amount that 
is reasonably/virtually certain to be realized.
L	
Provisions and contingencies
	
The Bank recognises a provision when there is present obligation as a result of a past event that probably requires 
an outflow of resources and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. A disclosure for a 
contingent liability is made when there is a possible obligation or a present obligation that may, but probably will 
not, require an outflow of resources. When there is a possible obligation or a present obligation in respect of which 
the likelihood of outflow of resources is remote, no provision or disclosure is made.
	
Provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate. If it is no 
longer probable that an outflow of resources would be required to settle the obligation, the provision is reversed. 
Contingent assets are not recognized in the financial statements. However, contingent assets are assessed 
continually and if it is virtually certain that an inflow of economic benefits will arise, the asset and related income 
are recognized in the period in which the change occurs.
M	
Earnings per share (EPS)
	
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit or loss after tax for the year attributable to equity 
shareholders by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year.
	
Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if contracts to issue equity shares were 
exercised or converted during the year. Diluted earnings per equity share is computed using the weighted average 
number of equity shares and dilutive potential equity shares outstanding during the year, except where the results 
are anti-dilutive.
N	
Cash and cash equivalents

18.2.2  Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) 
Qualitative disclosure around LCR
Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) is a global minimum standard for Bank’s liquidity. The ratio aims to ensure that a bank 
has an adequate stock of unencumbered High - Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) that can be converted into cash easily and 
immediately to meet its liquidity needs for a 30 calendar days of severe liquidity stress scenario.
The LCR is a ratio of High Quality Liquid Unencumbered Assets (HQLA) to total estimated net outflows over a stressed 
period of 30 calendar days.
The net cash outflows are calculated by applying RBI prescribed outflow factors to the various categories of liabilities 
(deposits, unsecured and secured wholesale borrowings), as well as to undrawn commitments and derivative-related 
exposures, partially offset by inflows from assets maturing within 30 days. 
The Board of Directors has the overall responsibility for management of liquidity risk. The Board at overall level decides 
the liquidity risk tolerance/limits and accordingly decides the strategy, policies and procedures of the Bank for managing 
liquidity risk. 	
The Board has constituted Risk Management Committee (RMC), which reports to the Board, and consisting of Chief 
Executive Officer (CEO) /Chairman and certain other Board members. The Committee is responsible for evaluating 
the overall risks faced by the Bank including liquidity risk. The potential interaction of liquidity risk with other risks is 
included in the risks addressed by the Risk Management Committee.
At the executive level, Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO) ensures adherence to the risk tolerance/limits 
set by the Board as well as implementing the liquidity risk management strategy of the Bank in line with Bank’s risk 
management objectives and risk tolerance. A dedicated desk within Treasury function of the Bank is responsible for the 
day-to-day / intra-day liquidity management.
ALCO of the Bank channelizes various business segments of the Bank to target good quality asset and liability 
profile to meet the Bank’s profitability as well as Liquidity requirements with the help of robust MIS and Risk Limit 
architecture of the Bank. 
The Bank has been maintaining HQLA (Level 1) primarily in the form of Excess CRR, excess SLR investments over and 
above mandatory requirement.

18.2.3 Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)
Qualitative disclosure around NSFR
In the backdrop of the global financial crisis that started in 2007, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) 
proposed certain reforms to strengthen global capital and liquidity regulations with the objective of promoting a 
more resilient banking sector. In this regard, comes into picture – “Basel III: International framework for liquidity risk 
measurement, standards and monitoring” which presented two minimum standards, viz., Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) 
and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) for funding liquidity.
The NSFR is defined as the amount of available stable funding relative to the amount of required stable funding. 
“Available stable funding” (ASF) is defined as the portion of capital and liabilities expected to be reliable over the time 
horizon of one year. The amount of stable funding required ("Required stable funding") (RSF) of a specific institution is 
a function of the liquidity characteristics and residual maturities of the various assets held by that institution as well as 
those of its off-balance sheet (OBS) exposures.
Minimum Requirement: ASF(Available Stable Funding)/RSF(Require Stable Funding)>=100. The Bank is required to 
maintain the NSFR on an ongoing basis on a standalone basis. The minimum NSFR requirement set out in the RBI 
guideline effective October 1, 2021 is 100%. 
The Board of Directors has the overall responsibility for management of liquidity risk. The Board at overall level decides 
the liquidity risk tolerance/limits and accordingly decides the strategy, policies and procedures of the Bank for managing 
liquidity risk. 	
At the executive level, Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO) ensures adherence to the risk tolerance/limits 
set by the Board as well as implementing the liquidity risk management strategy of the Bank in line with Bank’s risk 
management objectives and risk tolerance. A dedicated desk within Treasury function of the Bank is responsible for the 
day-to-day / intra-day liquidity management.

The Guidance Note on “Accounting for Employee Share Based Payments” issued by the ICAI establishes financial and 
reporting principles for employees share based payment plans. The Guidance Note applies to employee share based 
payment plans, the grant date in respect of which falls on or after April 01, 2005.  The Guidance Note also applies to 
transfers of shares or stock options of the parent of the enterprise, or shares or stock options of another enterprise in the 
same group as the enterprise, to the employees of the enterprise. The compensation costs of stock options granted to 
employees of the Bank are accounted using intrinsic value method.
Stock option activity under ESOP Plan in respect of employees of the Bank is as below: 
The compensation cost is calculated based on the intrinsic value method, wherein the excess of fair value of underlying 
equity shares as on the date of the grant over the exercise price of the options given to employees of the Bank under the 
ESOP scheme, is recognised as compensation cost and amortised over the vesting period. The Holding Company cross 
charges the compensation cost to the Bank to the extent it pertains to the employees of the Bank.
256
Impact of Fair Value Method on Net Profit/(Loss) and EPS
Had the compensation cost for the Holding company's  stock option plans outstanding been determined based on the 
fair value by using Black Scholes model, the Bank’s net profit/loss and earnings/loss per share would have been as per 
the proforma amounts indicated below:
