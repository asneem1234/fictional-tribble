7.	
Does the entity have any project related to reducing Greenhouse Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details.
	
Yes, the bank has many initiatives for reducing GHG emissions within its operations. A few notable initiatives and their potential 
impacts are summarized below.
	
Green buildings: Three of our largest offices by carpet area – Corporate Office, Airoli and NOC, Goregaon (all in Mumbai 
Metropolitan Region) are situated in certified green buildings. This is about 45% of the carpet area among our all the regional 
offices (barring branches) and 14% of all carpet area, inclusive of all India branches.
	
The 8th and 9th floors of NOC, Goregaon office is using 100% renewable energy from September 2022. Similarly, CO, Parel is 
also on 100% renewable energy. With a monthly consumption of 1.23 lakh units, this initiative will help avoid emissions of 1,017 
tCO2 annually. 
	
Solar roof top in branches: The bank has installed about 96 kWp renewable energy in its 21 rural branches, Sangli Office and 
Bank’s Head Office in Kolhapur, generating about 150 MWh of solar power in last FY, and avoiding GHG emissions of 141 tCO2. 
In addition, the bank finances various renewable energy, other emission reduction projects and electric vehicles etc. These in 
turn also help reduce the total GHG emissions.
	
The third-party data centers used are also Green Certified and use significant renewable energy for their operations.
	
Further, the bank has also taken a voluntary goal of being carbon neutral within operations by FY 34 through use of energy 
efficiency and renewable energy. In Q3 FY23, Bank’s Board has approved a Coal Policy. Accordingly, the exposure to coal based 
thermal power generation will be restricted to 2.5% of total exposure up to FY 2026-27, with ultimate objective of reducing it to 
zero by FY 2034.
