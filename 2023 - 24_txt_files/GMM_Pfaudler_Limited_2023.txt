Corporate 
Governance
Opportunity
A robust governance framework stands as the 
cornerstone of organizational excellence. By 
fostering a governance structure that is both 
responsive and inclusive, an organization fortifies 
its ability to weather unforeseen challenges 
and adapt with resilience. The vigilant oversight 
provided by governance committees, particularly 
in areas concerning environmental, social, and 
governance (ESG) factors, ensures alignment and 
propels the organization toward sustainability 
goals.
Within GMM Pfaudler, adherence to governance 
principles 
and 
the 
delineated 
charters 
of 
the Board's standing committees serve as a 
scaffolding for effective governance and diligent 
oversight of company affairs. Each committee 
fulfills a pivotal role in upholding our steadfast 
commitment to conducting business with the 
utmost adherence to corporate standards.

provides an organization with an opportunity 
to retain satisfied customers who in turn are a 
source of recurring revenues.
We strive to align our business objectives with 
our vision of becoming the most sought-after

By prioritizing eco-consciousness and social 
responsibility in every stage of production, GMM

a culture of innovation and reliability.

Responsible
Supply Chain
Risk
A sustainable supply chain embodies socially 
responsible 
business 
practices, 
crucial 
for 
mitigating various risks such as contractual, 
legal, and business continuity issues. Failing 
to strategically identify and collaborate with 
suppliers and partners offering essential products 
and services could expose the organization 
to these risks, highlighting the imperative of 
fostering strong partnerships and ethical sourcing 
practices.
GMM Pfaudler diligently employs a range of 
screening tools and checklists to meticulously 
evaluate suppliers and assess potential social 
risks. Our supplier Code of Conduct sets forth 
clear expectations, requiring all partners within 
the supply chain to fully adhere to relevant laws 
and standards governing corporate governance, 
social 
responsibility, 
and 
environmental 
stewardship. This commitment ensures that 
ethical practices permeate every aspect of our 
operations, fostering trust and accountability 
throughout our supply network.

commitment are the force behind our continued 
business success and the stakeholder trust we 
enjoy.
Providing 
a

and 
healthy 
workplace 
environment for our workers is critical to the 
success of our operations.
At GMM Pfaudler, our focus is on ensuring a safe 
workplace environment through technology, 
training, and strict safety protocols. All our 
facilities comply with ISO 45001 standards, 
maintain Emergency Response Plans, and 
monitor progress through behavior-based safety

Climate
Change
Risk
The increasing frequency of extreme weather 
events linked to climate change presents a 
tangible 
threat, 
potentially 
disrupting 
our 
operations and jeopardizing the safety and 
welfare of our employees.
We embrace environmental sustainability by 
implementing green policies, frameworks, and 
infrastructure. This includes prioritizing energy 
conservation and renewable energy to minimize 
our 
carbon 
footprint, 
adopting 
innovative 
technologies to manage waste in accordance 
with circular economy principles. We also employ 
operational and engineering controls to reduce 
freshwater consumption and manage water 
resources through sewage treatment, recycling 
treated 
water, 
and 
rainwater 
harvesting. 
Additionally, we implement waste management 
practices such as recycling, reusing, and 
minimizing waste generation, while ensuring 
supply chain sustainability through responsible 
sourcing.

Community
Development
Opportunity
Establishing a strong connection with the 
community is crucial for the Company's sustained 
success and value creation. GMM Pfaudler adopts 
a tripartite approach to community outreach:
Healthcare: We contribute to local communities 
by initiating preventive healthcare programs and 
offering support to hospitals.

Energy and

Management
Opportunity
Energy is crucial for economic growth and life 
prosperity. Availability and reliability of energy 
has always been a concern not only for an 
organization but also for the world at large. 
All production facilities adhere to ISO 50001 
standards. The Company has a renewable energy 
portfolio of 1 MW Solar energy. The renewable 
energy generated contributes to 6% of total 
electricity needs and helped the organization 
in avoiding 862.62 tCO₂e in FY24. Additionally, 
our Company regularly implements a variety of 
energy-saving strategies to cut down on energy 
use and emissions footprints.

Water and 
Wastewater 
Management
Risk & 
Opportunity
Water, being a finite resource, requires careful 
planning, distribution, and management to 
optimize its usage. Its availability and utilization 
significantly impact both the environment and 
society.
GMM Pfaudler's operational regions strictly 
adhere to pollution control board guidelines. Our 
manufacturing plants implement wastewater 
treatment and recycling measures, effectively 
reducing 
our 
freshwater 
consumption 
and 
minimizing the impact on water resources used 
for domestic and agricultural purposes.

Waste 
Management
Risk & 
Opportunity
Efficient resource utilization entails minimizing and 
reusing waste, along with incorporating recycled 
materials whenever feasible. Effective waste 
management procedures, including separation, 
collection, 
and 
disposal, 
are 
imperative. 
Regulations governing waste management are 
essential to ensure proper reuse, recycling, and 
disposal, particularly as expanding landfills and 
dumpsites pose risks to air, soil, and water quality.
GMM Pfaudler has implemented comprehensive 
strategies 
to 
minimize 
waste 
production 
throughout the manufacturing cycle. We prioritize 
waste reduction at every level to align with legal 
requirements and safeguard the environment. 
Waste is responsibly disposed of at Transport, 
Storage, and Disposal Facilities (TSDF) to ensure 
compliance and prevent adverse environmental 
impacts. Moreover, we strictly prohibit the use of 
single-use, non-biodegradable plastics on our 
premises.

Ethics and 
Compliance
Risk
Operating 
with 
the 
utmost 
integrity 
and 
ethics is a fundamental responsibility of any 
organization. Non-compliance with regulations 
and subsequent penalties can directly impact 
company operations and lead to financial strain.
GMM Pfaudler is dedicated to upholding ethical 
standards and achieving compliance excellence. 
Through a robust Code of Conduct, we instill values 
of integrity, transparency, and respect across 
all levels of the organization. This framework 
emphasizes adherence to laws, prevention of 
conflicts of interest, and safeguarding Company 
assets, fostering a safe and inclusive workplace. 
Supported by strong governance, our compliance 
structure 
remains 
adaptable 
to 
evolving 
regulations and risks. Regular training and open 
communication channels empower employees 
to maintain high ethical standards and report 
concerns confidentially, ensuring our continued 
commitment to integrity and compliance.

Business Responsibility & Sustainability Reporting
10. Health and safety management system:
a.  Whether an occupational health 
and safety management system 
has been implemented by the 
entity? (Yes/ No). If yes, the 
coverage of such system?
Yes, GMM Pfaudler places significant importance on the safety and 
well-being of its employees and other relevant stakeholders. As 
evidence of this commitment, our HSEMS in all three plants have 
been certified to meet the ISO 45001:2018 standard.
b.  What are the processes used to 
identify work-related hazards and 
assess risks on a routine and non-
routine basis by the entity?
At GMM Pfaudler, the methods employed to detect occupational 
hazards and evaluate risks regularly and irregularly include:
1. Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA): This requires 
a thorough assessment of the work environment and operational 
tasks to identify any possible hazards that could harm employees, 
visitors, or the surrounding ecosystem. The risk associated with each 
identified hazard is carefully assessed to determine the likelihood 
and potential consequences of an incident occurring. After analyzing 
the situation, appropriate actions are developed and implemented.
2. Health and Safety Inspections: This involves a comprehensive 
review of the organization's policies, procedures, and practices 
related to environmental management, health, and safety. An HSE 
inspection and audit helps identify areas for improvement to reduce 
the risk of incidents or accidents. Furthermore, it fulfills the role of 
confirming the organization's compliance with relevant regulatory 
obligations and industry standards. Based on the results of an HSE 
audit and inspection, we have developed corrective action plans to 
address any areas that need improvement.
c.  Whether you have processes for 
workers to report the work related 
hazards and to remove themselves 
from such risks. (Y/N)
Yes, GMM Pfaudler has implemented an online App & Web Portal 
that allows employees at all levels to easily report any work-related 
hazards. The Factory Heads and HSE Managers diligently monitor 
and address all reported work hazards.
d.  Do the employees/ worker of 
the entity have access to non-
occupational medical and 
healthcare services? (Yes/ No)
Yes, all our employees are covered under Health & Accidental 
Insurance which can be used for any non-occupational medical & 
healthcare service.

12. Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy work place.
 
GMM Pfaudler has established a robust framework to ensure a safe and healthy workplace through a 
combination of rigorous compliance measures, training, and emergency preparedness. Regular work permit 
issuances, safety inductions, and safety committee meetings enforce adherence to established safety 
protocols, supported by behavior-based safety initiatives and comprehensive shop floor inspections. We 
enhance contractor safety through a dedicated Safety Induction program and an EHS training card system. 
GMM Pfaudler
22
Our commitment to continuous improvement is demonstrated through regular internal and external HSE 
audits, including third-party safety audits and ISO 45001 & 14001 certifications, with risk assessments and 
controls validated by TUV SUD. Emergency preparedness is prioritized with detailed site-specific plans and 
regular mock drills covering potential emergencies such as fire, electric shock, and snake bites, alongside 
extensive training in hazard awareness and safe material handling. Health monitoring is conducted via 
pre-employment check-ups and annual medical tests. Additionally, an online platform facilitates prompt 
reporting and management of work-related hazards. The maintenance of workplace safety is further 
supported by "5S" practices, and the organization's safety culture is reinforced through the celebration 
of National Safety Week and the recognition of safety achievements. Notably, these comprehensive 
safety measures have led to zero reportable injuries or accidents in FY24, highlighting the effectiveness of 
our approach.

GMM Pfaudler have implemented several corrective actions to enhance health and safety practices across 
our operations. This includes Behavior-Based and Safety Induction Training for all employees, particularly 
new hires and contractors, to ensure comprehensive familiarity with safety protocols. We have improved 
safety equipment and facilities on the shop floor by adding first aid boxes, fire extinguishers, and clear 
safety visuals. Trolleys for safer cylinder transportation, guards on grinding machines, and specialized 
equipment such as scaffolds, scissor lifts, and safety harnesses for high-altitude work have been introduced. 
Additional enhancements include screens for grinding work, marked gangways and aisles, standardized 
personal protective equipment, and advanced electrical safety features like distribution boards with RCCB 
and top plugs. These measures reflect our ongoing commitment to maintaining a safe work environment 
by continually identifying risks and implementing necessary improvements.

LEADERSHIP INDICATORS
1.  Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, 
and social topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the 
Board.
 
Stakeholder engagement plays a vital role in driving growth ambitions. The Board has given its approval 
to the Company's 3-year Strategy and Roadmap. The ESG Steering Committee implements the roadmap 
in accordance with the Company's ESG vision. It establishes sustainability goals, offers targeted guidance 
and operational insights to the ESG working groups, evaluates public disclosures, and engages with 
stakeholders to address their concerns. The Chief Executive Officer leads the ESG Steering Committee. 
Regular board reviews are conducted every quarter, providing an opportunity for the board to engage in in-
depth discussions with the Chief Executive Officer regarding sustainability progress and concerns raised 
by stakeholders. This Committee serves as the platform for stakeholders to engage with the Board of the 
organization.
 
The Company's commitment to transparency and providing stakeholders with a complete view of its 
performance and progress towards ESG commitments is evident in its comprehensive reporting approach. 
2. Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, 
and social topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from 
stakeholders on these topics were incorporated into policies and activities of the entity. 
 
Yes, the Company, in collaboration with stakeholders, has identified significant environmental and 
social issues. We shortlisted and prioritized material topics based on their impact on stakeholders and 
the business. Information regarding this can be found in the Materiality Assessment section of the ESG 
report. The Company's initiatives in the field of Corporate Social Responsibility are carefully planned and 
implemented based on the needs of the communities, including vulnerable and marginalized groups, as 
well as other community members. 
3. Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of 
vulnerable/ marginalized stakeholder groups. 
 
At GMM Pfaudler, we are committed to addressing the concerns of vulnerable and marginalized groups. 
Recently, two schools in Karamsad and Vatva approached us for assistance with infrastructure and 
student accessories. In response, we constructed handwash stations, separate washrooms for boys and 
girls, water purifiers, water coolers, and protective shades for these coolers and purifiers. Additionally, we 
distributed school bags and PT uniforms to the students. These efforts have significantly improved the 
educational environment and basic needs for students, demonstrating our dedication to supporting and 
uplifting marginalized communities through proactive engagement and meaningful action.
