pose a substantial risk, 
possibly leading to shutdowns 
of production units and

Waste 
Reduction and 
Management
Risk
It is an organization’s sole 
responsibility to manage the 
appropriate disposal of all 
types of waste. Failure in this 
respect can invite legal action, 
fines, or other penalties.
We have established an 
objective of reducing waste 
generated in our operations 
and continually strive to 
lessen its influence on the 
environment.
Negative
6.
Energy and 
GHG Emissions 
Reduction
Risk
Our operations and business 
activities are at risk to face 
potential short, medium, 
and long-term impacts due 
to the continually changing 
regulatory environment. Rapid 
shifts in these regulations 
demand careful navigation 
and adherence to fend 
off potential disruptions. 
Additionally, the physical 
manifestations of climate 
change, including changing 
rainfall and temperature 
patterns, coupled with an 
escalating frequency of 
severe weather incidents, 
pose sizeable risks to our 
operations. It is crucial for us 
to assess these threats and 
strategize our responses.
We are determined to 
reduce our greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions by 
investing in technologies 
that enhance efficiency of 
our operations and reduce 
negative environmental 
impact. Further, we aim to 
understand climate change’s 
broader impacts on our 
operations and supply chain, 
evaluating possible risks, and 
identifying viable solutions 
for mitigating.

7.
 Water 
Management
Risk
The amount of water 
withdrawn in areas 
experiencing high levels of 
water stress can significantly 
impact the needs of the 
communities nearby. Hence, 
we understand the importance 
of managing water responsibly 
and aim to manage its impact.
We are dedicated to decrease 
our freshwater intake via 
adoption of water-saving 
technologies, optimizing our 
production processes, and 
encouraging responsible 
water usage across all our 
operations. Our persistent 
actions demonstrate our 
commitment to sustainable 
water management.

Human Rights 
and Fair Labour 
Standards
Risk
Neglecting human rights 
violations and labor relations 
can result in protests and 
strikes, severely impacting our 
productivity. Such cases often 
draw concerns from external 
stakeholders. We strive to 
take a proactive approach 
towards human rights issues 
and promote positive labor 
relations.
We value the feedback and 
concerns of our employees, 
fostering an environment that 
encourages open dialogue. 
We actively promote and 
support employee unions 
to protect labor rights. By 
facilitating free expression 
and endorsing collective 
negotiations, we are 
dedicated towards creating 
an equitable and inclusive 
workspace.

Injuries sustained in

reduce such occurrences by 
establishing a safe workspace.

standards of health and 
safety, we continually revise 
and updates our health and 
safety policy. We constantly 
recognize the areas that 
need improvement. We aim 
to achieve  Zero Accidents

for Board and Senior Management. Additionally, we inform our shareholders about how disputes are resolved via our Grievance 
Redressal Policy. During this financial year, we addressed 32 shareholder grievances and all are resolved. Generally, we strive to 
minimize related party transactions except the RPT of routine in nature at Arm’s length basis. Nevertheless, in certain scenarios, 
a robust system is in place to obtain necessary approval from the Board / Audit committee and shareholders. This system is 
activated as and when required during business operations. Additionally, directors with a vested interest are expressly excluded 
from decision-making concerning Related Party Transactions (RPT).

other waste.
	
Our organization is deeply committed to enhancing process 
efficiency and product stewardship. We place a high value 
on minimizing waste and augmenting waste utilization, 
viewing these actions as integral to our mission and drive.
	
a)	
Plastic waste- We are continuously working with M/s 
Shakti Plastics Industries to collect and dispose off 
plastic waste as part of our Plastic Waste Management 
(PWM) Program that has been implemented in several 
states. This year we have recycled 3369.62 MT of 
plastic packaging waste.

Yes. We at GHCL actively comply with Extended Producer 
Responsibility (EPR), focusing on the sustainable and 
economical management of product end-of-life scenarios. In 
line with the EPR strategy, we have implemented a waste 
collection plan and a thorough program for the collection 
and disposal of product packaging. To fulfil our EPR 
obligations, which require producers to account for 100% 
of the plastic packaging introduced in the market, we have 
developed and submitted a Brand Owner action plan. This 
action plan has been subsequently approved by the Central 
Pollution Control Board (CPCB) for implementation.

part of our business operations. We have initiated several 
steps to ensure the effectiveness of the occupational health 
and safety management system.

Do you have a focal point (Individual/ Committee) 
responsible for addressing human rights impacts 
or issues caused or contributed to by the business? 
(Yes/No)
	
We’ve instituted a complaints resolution panel and a POSH 
team to address any human rights issues that may arise during 
our operations. Our employees are actively encouraged to 
report instances of harassment, victimization, intimidation, 
or bias without fear of retaliation or unfair treatment. 
Upon receiving a complaint, the committee undertakes a 
comprehensive investigation and takes necessary actions to 
resolve the issue to the satisfaction of all parties involved.
5.	
Describe the internal mechanisms in place to 
redress grievances related to human rights issues.
	
At GHCL, we are deeply committed to upholding human 
rights, and to this end, we have implemented a policy to 
ensure our adherence to this principle. We have established 
two essential committees: the POSH (Prevention of Sexual 
Harassment) Committee and the Grievance Redressal 
Committee, tasked with addressing potential human 
rights issues. The POSH Committee is responsible for 
identifying and preventing instances of sexual harassment 
in the workplace, operating in accordance with the Sexual 
Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition, 
and Redressal) Act, which applies to all GHCL employees and 
workers. Additionally, the Grievance Redressal Committee 
follows our Executive Grievance Redressal Policy and 
manages issues through the GHCL Employee Management 
System (GEMS), ensuring that grievances are handled in 
accordance with established procedures. The committee 
operates at two levels, allowing for escalation to the next 
level if the initial response is deemed inadequate, provided 
with a thorough justification. We are dedicated to addressing 
and resolving complaints promptly, committing to providing 
a comprehensive response within a 30-day timeframe.

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to 
the complainant in discrimination and harassment 
cases.
	
At GHCL, we strongly believe in providing equal opportunities 
to all individuals and firmly oppose any form of discrimination 
or harassment based on characteristics such as race, gender, 
nationality, ethnicity, origin, religion, age, disability, or sexual 
orientation. To uphold this principle, we have implemented 
various policies concerning non-discrimination, prevention 
of sexual harassment (POSH), whistleblowing, and grievance 
redressal. These policies demonstrate our commitment 
to our employees and ensure compliance with relevant 
regulations. Our GHCL Employee Management System 
(GEMS) provides a platform for employees to raise concerns 
at any time. Additionally, we regularly conduct workshops, 
group meetings, online modules, and awareness campaigns 
to educate our teams on preventing sexual harassment 
in the workplace.
9.	
Do human rights requirements form part of your 
business agreements and contracts?
	
Yes. Our organization strictly enforces a policy requiring all 
external party contracts to meet human rights standards 
and address related issues. To ensure these standards 
are being met, we’ve put into place internal controls and 
surveillance procedures. Regular reviews of these contracts 
are conducted to confirm adherence to our regulations. We 
are also in the process of creating an oversight mechanism 
to guarantee our business partners’ compliance with these 
human rights norms.

We are dedicated to reducing our carbon footprint through various initiatives, including the implementation of advanced technology, 
energy-efficient upgrades, and renewable energy adoption like wind and solar power. Despite our energy-intensive manufacturing 
processes, we continuously monitor and manage emissions to minimize environmental impact.  Please find below some of the 
initiatives taken by us during the reporting year:
 
 
 To reduce energy consumption, our soda ash facility installed eight Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs) in centrifugal pumps, 
allowing adjustable fan speeds to meet operational needs. This innovation curbed unnecessary power use, minimized 
power surges, and significantly reduced specific power consumption, demonstrating the effectiveness of VFDs in enhancing 
operational efficiency and sustainability.
 
 
 The Dense Ash Plant implemented strategies to reduce steam consumption by optimizing steam trap use and enhancing 
process control. Through rigorous inspections, preventive maintenance, and measures like steam pipe insulation, steam 
demand was reduced. This resulted in decreased energy costs, prolonged equipment life, and a smaller environmental 
footprint, highlighting the potential for energy savings and operational efficiency.
 
 
 GHCL launched a 150 TPD energy-efficient Rotating Biological Contactor (RBC) plant with cutting-edge technology for 
wastewater treatment and energy savings. This reflects our dedication to sustainability and environmental responsibility. The

Describe the mechanisms in place to receive and respond to consumer complaints and feedback.
	
We have put in place a system to address customer complaints promptly and effectively, managed by a devoted team. To ensure 
seamless user experience, a thorough procedure to resolve complaints has been formulated. If customers express issues with wet 
bags, logistics, or the quality of materials upon delivery, these are meticulously evaluated by our marketing, logistics, and quality 
departments. In coordination with this, a fresh sales document is produced to monitor the complaint’s progress.
	
Complaints are grouped into two key categories:
	
-	
ZRCL - Related to logistics
	
-	
ZRCQ - Pertaining to quality
	
After categorizing the issue, the following procedures are carried out:
 
 
The Marketing department identifies the nature of the complaint, formulates a return sales order, and includes all relevant 
details of the complaint.
