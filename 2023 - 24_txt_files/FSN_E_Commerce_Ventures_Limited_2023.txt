Sustainable 
Sourcing 
(Raw 
materials/ 
product 
sourcing)
Risk & 
Opportunity
Sustainable sourcing is crucial for 
Nykaa to meet evolving consumer 
expectations, address concerns 
from NGOs, and strengthen our 
overall ESG performance.
Prioritizing sustainability enhances 
supply chain resilience, reduces 
environmental impact, and builds 
brand reputation. It allows for 
partnerships with like- minded 
suppliers and may open doors to 
collaboration with ethical investors.
Nykaa 
has 
implemented 
sustainable 
sourcing practices, including the utilization 
of recycled plastics for packaging needs 
within our operations. Approximately 85% 
of our packaging materials are sourced 
from eco-friendly sources.
Additionally, the company predominantly 
procures packaging materials from small 
and medium-scale enterprises, aiming 
to foster the MSME ecosystem as a 
component of our social responsibility 
initiatives.
Negative & 
Positive
2
Privacy and 
Data Security
Risk
As an e-commerce platform, 
Nykaa recognizes that robust 
cybersecurity 
and 
data 
protection are essential for 
maintaining consumer trust. 
Protecting sensitive customer 
information 
safeguards 
our 
reputation, minimizes the risk of 
legal and financial penalties, and 
ensures compliance with data 
privacy regulations.
Proactive 
data 
protection 
measures foster customer loyalty 
and can become a competitive 
advantage in the long term.
Nykaa allocates substantial resources 
to cyber-security and data protection 
measures, which encompass regular 
assessments 
(including 
third-party 
assessments) of vital IT systems and 
technological infrastructure.
Utilizing 
cutting-edge 
cybersecurity 
technologies and IT control systems, the 
company maintains a proactive stance. 
Furthermore, 
regular 
company-wide 
awareness sessions are conducted for 
all employees to uphold and disseminate 
best practices in cybersecurity.

Labour 
Management
Risk & 
Opportunity
Adherence to labor laws and 
ethical 
practices 
across 
our 
operations and supply chain is a 
non- negotiable commitment. It 
mitigates legal and reputational 
risks while building a positive 
employer brand for Nykaa in a 
competitive talent market.
Proactive compliance attracts 
socially 
conscious 
partners, 
customers, 
and 
employees, 
creating positive ripple effects 
for the company’s growth and 
social impact
Nykaa 
has 
undertaken 
significant 
initiatives to ensure full compliance with 
labour regulations as mandated by law. We 
have partnered with a Tier 1 Compliance 
consultant, and adherence is periodically 
reviewed.

Supply Chain 
Management
Risk & 
Opportunity
An 
efficient 
and 
resilient 
supply chain is directly linked 
to Nykaa’s revenue, customer 
satisfaction, and environmental 
footprint. Disruptions can lead 
to significant financial losses and 
damage our reputation amongst 
customers.
Optimizing our supply chain 
mitigates 
risks, 
reduces 
operational 
costs, 
decreases 
emissions, 
and 
builds 
adaptability 
to 
challenges 
posed by geopolitical events, 
extreme weather, or potential 
infrastructure failures.
Nykaa operates a decentralized supply 
chain strategy focused on localized 
fulfillment, facilitating deliveries from the 
closest fulfillment centers. This approach 
optimizes 
shipment 
expenses 
and 
inventory investments while leveraging 
economies of scale and reducing ecological 
impact. 
Furthermore, 
the 
company 
ensures that its business partners and 
suppliers adhere strictly to human rights 
compliance, encompassing regulations 
concerning child labor, forced labor, 
harassment prevention, discriminatory 
employment practices, and other labor 
standards.

Product 
Safety and 
Quality
Risk & 
Opportunity
Nykaa 
understands 
the 
paramount 
importance 
of 
ensuring the safety and quality 
of products sold on the platform. 
A rigorous focus on safety 
builds strong customer trust, 
differentiates us in the market, 
and minimizes the risk of product 
recalls 
and 
costly 
lawsuits. 
Investing in testing, adhering to 
safety regulations, and sourcing 
high-quality ingredients are key 
components of our long-term 
commitment 
to 
responsible 
product development.
(a) Our 
proprietary 
product 
designs 
prioritize ethically sourced ingredients 
and 
adhere 
to 
environmentally 
friendly formulations, aligning with 
established regulatory frameworks. 
Rigorous safety testing is conducted 
throughout the development process 
to ensure product safety during use 
and over time. Employing low carbon 
footprint production practices in 
accordance with Good Manufacturing 
Practices (GMP), our consciously 
curated formulations are packaged 
using 
environmentally 
acceptable 
materials. Prior to launch, products 
undergo extensive testing with real 
consumers to ensure an exceptional 
consumer experience. As a socially 
responsible brand, the majority of our 
product designs are Paraben-free, 
Mineral oil free, cruelty free, Vegan, 
and utilize Natural actives, among 
other considerations.
(b) Our 
suppliers 
are 
dedicated 
to 
providing products and services of the

standards.

Risk
As an e-commerce platform,

practices on the platform.
Implementing robust consumer 
protection measures mitigates 
financial 
and 
reputational 
risks while fostering a sense of 
security that fuels long-term 
growth and customer loyalty.
Nykaa has instituted protocols aimed 
at identifying and mitigating fraudulent 
activities and scams, enhancing consumer 
experiences, 
and 
bolstering 
overall 
satisfaction levels.
These measures include fostering an 
environment 
conducive

concerns, closely monitoring high-risk 
activities, assessing sellers based on 
transactional 
histories, 
and 
imposing 
restrictions or suspensions on certain

that 
attracting, 
developing, 
and 
retaining 
a 
skilled, 
motivated workforce is crucial 
for 
innovation, 
operational 
efficiency, and sustained growth.

to drive growth and customer 
acquisition. 
Compliance 
with 
advertising

in 
product 
labeling are key priorities. These 
practices build trust, safeguard 
the company’s reputation, and 
create a positive brand image, 
while minimizing the risk of legal 
liabilities.
Nykaa is actively engaged in cultivating 
a robust customer base through a 
comprehensive 360- degree marketing 
strategy, encompassing digital marketing, 
mass media, diverse content channels, and 
offline initiatives. This approach mitigates 
reliance on any singular marketing channel, 
ensuring a balanced outreach strategy.
Moreover, the company meticulously 
adheres 
to 
industry 
regulations 
by 
prominently 
displaying 
all

Nykaa recognizes the importance of operating responsibly and creating a positive social and environmental impact. As a result, we are actively developing a 
robust Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) framework. This framework will establish specific goals designed to drive continuous improvement within 
our operations and contribute to a more sustainable future. The Nykaa 10x10 initiatives, launched in 2020, are a testament to our ambition across a range of 
ESG issues including sustainable packaging, energy consumption, and employee well-being. These initiatives were reviewed and updated this year to reflect our 
continued commitment.
Minimizing our environmental footprint is a top priority. In FY 23-24, we achieved a significant milestone by sourcing approximately 85% of our packaging 
materials from eco-friendly sources and recycling over 141 tonnes of plastic combined from the premises of FSN E-commerce Ventures and Nykaa E-Retail. We 
prioritise the usage of energy efficient fixtures in our operational locations where feasible. Our Private Label warehouses have achieved a 100% reuse rate for 
cardboard box waste. Nykaa has been compliant with the applicable Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) requirements since 2021.
Additionally, we have significantly increased our order fulfillment capacity by adopting digital tabs in place of printed order tickets, achieving zero paper utilization 
for orders processed. Furthermore, we are committed to fostering responsible practices throughout our supply chain. FY 23-24 saw the implementation of a 
comprehensive human rights policy for Nykaa employees, a crucial first step towards ensuring ethical practices across our value chain. The composition of our 
Board of Directors demonstrates a strong commitment to gender diversity, with women holding 40% of the seats and approximately 50% of the committees 
are chaired by women.
Transparency and responsible sourcing are critical. Currently, Nykaa is developing clear ethical sourcing guidelines for suppliers. These guidelines will prioritize 
the use of sustainable raw materials and responsible production processes. The implementation of these guidelines represents a significant step towards a more 
sustainable future. Furthermore, we are exploring renewable energy options for our facilities, demonstrating our commitment to continuous reduction of our 
environmental footprint.
The Nykaa Foundation has partnered with Rangeet, an innovative impact-initiative organization, to launch an app-based learning program called “SEEK” (Social, 
Emotional, and Ecological Knowledge). Approximately 20,000 students have benefited from this program. In partnership with Labournet, around 800 women 
from marginalized backgrounds have been trained to become skilled beauty professionals
Our MD & CEO, Ms. Falguni Nayar, announced a 3-year association between Nykaa and the American India Foundation (AIF) to promote STEM education for girls in 
India. Additionally, Nykaa supported three tournaments in FY 2024 to deepen our partnership with the Indian Deaf Cricket Association (IDCA).
Nykaa remains committed to ongoing monitoring and improvement in all areas of ESG.

Environmental Stewardship:
At Nykaa, we remain committed to building a climate-conscious culture and minimizing our environmental footprint. We have made substantial strides in 
reducing plastic consumption and remain committed to further advancements in this area. Resource optimization and circularity are key priorities, as evidenced 
by our achievement of 100% corrugated box reuse within our Private Label warehouses. Over the past year, we have significantly enhanced our data collection 
capabilities to gain a comprehensive understanding of our environmental footprint, including energy consumption and waste generation. This robust data 
foundation will inform our strategic sustainability initiatives, such as the accelerated adoption of renewable energy sources.
Social Responsibility:
We are proud to announce that our human rights policy was successfully implemented this year. This policy reaffirms our commitment to upholding ethical labor 
practices across our entire supply chain.
Continuous Improvement:
We understand that our journey towards becoming a truly responsible and sustainable organization is a continuous one. We actively seek external validation of 
our efforts, and this year, we achieved the BRSR Core Assurance certification by TUV India. This demonstrates our dedication to adhering to best practices in 
business responsibility and sustainability reporting.
Looking Ahead:
We are committed to ongoing improvement in all areas of our BRSR performance. We will continue to refine our data collection processes, explore new 
avenues for environmental responsibility, and strengthen our social responsibility initiatives. We have presented our strategic focus areas and initiatives to key 
stakeholders, including our investors. Our next steps involve leveraging this valuable feedback to establish clear, measurable goals and targets. To foster deeper 
alignment and collaboration, we will implement a robust stakeholder engagement program built on regular, transparent communication. We are confident that 
these efforts will contribute positively to a more sustainable future for our industry and society at large.

has established agreements with authorized CPCB-registered recyclers. Furthermore, the company successfully achieved its EPR 
target for FY2024 through a designated recycler, fulfilling all necessary updates for annual filings on the EPR portal.

10.	Health and safety management system:
a.	
Whether an occupational health and safety 
management system has been implemented 
by the entity? (Yes/ No). If yes, the coverage 
of such a system?
 
The Company prioritizes the health and safety of all 
stakeholders, encompassing employees, customers, 
business partners, suppliers, and visitors. This commitment 
is formalized through our comprehensive Health, Safety, and 
Environment (HSE) Policy.
 
The HSE Policy establishes a robust framework for managing 
all aspects of safety and environmental well-being. This 
framework includes:
•	
Proactive Risk Management: We actively identify and 
mitigate potential safety and environmental hazards to 
minimize risks.
•	
Performance Monitoring and Benchmarking: Our practices 
are continuously monitored and benchmarked against 
industry standards to ensure ongoing improvement in 
HSE performance.
•	
Enhanced Incident Management: Reporting and 
investigation procedures for safety incidents are 
continually strengthened, allowing for effective learning 
and prevention of future occurrences.
•	
Continuous Improvement Programs: Regular audits and 
ongoing improvement programs are implemented to 
foster a culture of safety throughout the organization.
•	
Employee Engagement: We actively encourage employee 
engagement in upholding safety standards by promoting 
their involvement in safety initiatives.
•	
Comprehensive Safety Awareness Programs: Employees 
are equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills 
through comprehensive training and communication 
programs that emphasize established safety policies and 
best practices.
•	
Dissemination of Learnings: Learnings gained from past 
incidents are actively disseminated to prevent similar 
occurrences in the future.
 
Nykaa’s commitment to safety extends to all our workplaces. 
We continuously integrate and improve our HSE systems, 
ensuring the highest safety standards for both existing 
and new facilities. This year, we strengthened emergency 
preparedness by establishing Emergency Response Teams 
(ERTs) across all warehouses. These teams support the 
implementation of emergency evacuation plans and enhance 
safety measures during critical situations. Furthermore, 
multiple training sessions were conducted throughout the 
year to reinforce safety awareness among all employees.
 
To ensure adherence to safety regulations from time to time, 
Nykaa undergoes external HSE audits of all locations.
b.	 What are the processes used to identify work-
related hazards and assess risks on a routine 
and non-routine basis by the entity?
 
The Company prioritizes maintaining a safe working 
environment for all employees. The inherent nature of our 
operations minimizes the risk of exposure to hazardous 
materials. No major incidents or accidents occurred in the 
workplace during FY24. The severity of any incidents that 
did occur was very low. Monthly monitoring of workplace 
incidents allows for early identification and mitigation of 
potential hazards.
 
Recognizing the importance of proactive safety measures, 
Nykaa is committed to ongoing improvement in this area. In 
the near future, we will plan for an activity- based HIRA.
c.	
Whether you have processes for workers 
to report the work-related hazards and to 
remove themselves from such risks. (Y/N)
 
Nykaa prioritizes fostering a culture of safety and open 
communication. To achieve this, we have developed and 
implemented a comprehensive incident reporting mechanism 
across all workplaces.
 
A dedicated Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) Single Point 
of Contact (SPOC) is appointed for each location. Employees 
are encouraged to report all incidents, including near misses 
and unsafe conditions, directly to their designated HSE SPOC. 
These SPOCs are responsible for:
•	
Incident Reporting Intake: Receiving and documenting all 
reported incidents.
•	
Investigative Action: Initiating appropriate investigations 
into reported incidents.
•	
Corrective Action Implementation: Developing and 
implementing corrective actions to address identified 
hazards and prevent future occurrences.
 
Workers are actively informed about the incident reporting 
mechanism through regular training sessions. Additionally, 
QR codes are strategically placed throughout workplaces to 
allow for the immediate reporting of near misses and unsafe 
conditions via mobile devices. This multi-faceted approach 
empowers employees to actively participate in maintaining a 
safe working environment.
d.	 Do the employees/ worker of the entity have 
access to non-occupational medical and 
healthcare services? (Yes/ No)
 
Given the non-hazardous nature of our operations, Nykaa 
does not maintain an in- house health care center. However, 
we prioritize the well-being of our employees by having readily 
available first-aid boxes in all accessible workplace locations. 
Additionally, the Company has established a partnership with a 
doctor to ensure access to medical services when necessary. 
We also offer voluntary one-to-one counselling available 
in telephonic, virtual & in-person sessions conducted by 
external mental health professionals. This initiative extends 
to employees and their families.

operations, and continuous improvement initiatives.
	
Infrastructure Measures:
 
Comprehensive Safety Systems: All Nykaa offices are 
equipped with essential safety systems, including smoke 
detectors, public address systems, sprinklers, and fire hydrant

when a new facility is opened.
	
Operational Measures:
 
Safety Training and Awareness: Nykaa provides regular safety 
training programs / awareness to employees and workers, 
ensuring they possess the necessary knowledge and skills to 
identify and respond to potential hazards.

are conducted regularly in collaboration with building 
management teams. These drills assess preparedness 
levels, identify areas for improvement, and bolster employee 
confidence in handling emergency situations.
 
Proactive Hazard Identification: We are committed to 
proactive risk management through ongoing Health, Safety, 
and Environment (HSE) audits. These audits help us identify 
potential hazards and risks before incidents occur, allowing 
for timely mitigation strategies.
 
Readily Available First-Aid Support: First-aid boxes are readily 
available at all Nykaa workplaces to ensure prompt treatment 
for minor injuries.
 
Emergency Response Teams (ERTs): To further enhance 
emergency preparedness, Nykaa has established Emergency 
Response Teams (ERTs) comprised of first aid trained 
personnel and fire-fighting teams. These teams play a 
critical role in responding to emergencies and ensuring 
employee safety.
 
HSE Induction and E-Learning Modules: All new employees 
undergo comprehensive HSE inductions to familiarize them 
with company safety policies and procedures. Additionally, an 
e- learning module on HSE policy is available to all employees, 
promoting ongoing awareness and knowledge retention.
	
Future Strategies:
 
Standardized Training Modules: Nykaa is committed to 
continuous improvement in its safety program. We are 
currently developing Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) 
for employee based HSE training modules. These standardized 
modules will ensure consistency and comprehensiveness in 
safety training across the organization.
 
Formalized Mock Drill Protocols: SOPs and guidelines 
for conducting mock drills are also under development. 
Formalizing these procedures will further strengthen 
our emergency preparedness efforts and ensure a more 
systematic approach to conducting drills.

Outcome of

1.
A shift 
towards 
increased 
utilization 
of paper 
over plastic 
and the 
incorporation 
of recycled 
plastic 
materials.
Nykaa has implemented several impactful initiatives within its packaging processes. Firstly, 
the company has significantly reduced the usage of plastic bubble wrap, opting instead for 
eco-friendly alternatives to minimize plastic waste.
Furthermore, Nykaa has revamped its corrugated box designs to align with eco- conscious 
principles. The new boxes prominently display messages emphasizing their 100% recycled and 
eco-friendly nature, along with social media logos and instructions for customer engagement.
In addition, Nykaa has taken steps to reduce the usage of BOPP tape, effectively cutting down 
its consumption by approximately 30%. This reduction not only diminishes the company’s 
carbon footprint but also contributes to overall resource conservation.
Moreover, in a move towards streamlined luxury packaging, Nykaa has eliminated the 
practice of including separate thank-you cards in luxury boxes. Instead, these messages are 
now integrated within the luxury box itself, enhancing the aesthetic appeal while reducing 
unnecessary paper usage.
Resulted 
in reduced 
plastic usage, 
increased 
eco-friendly 
materials, and 
streamlined 
luxury 
packaging, 
enhancing 
sustainability

Tree 
plantation in

Nykaa has initiated a commendable endeavor in environmental stewardship by spearheading 
a tree plantation initiative outside the confines of its warehouse premises. This initiative, 
which was initiated by our valued partner, signifies a collaborative effort towards ecological 
sustainability and conservation.
A notable milestone in this initiative was the generous donation of 254 trees to the Trees 
for Tigers project in Ramtek, Maharashtra, India, as part of Project Aranyam. In recognition 
of this significant contribution, Nykaa received a certificate acknowledging its dedication to 
environmental welfare and the proactive steps taken to mitigate the impacts of deforestation 
and habitat loss.
