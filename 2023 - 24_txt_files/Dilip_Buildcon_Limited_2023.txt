organization’s development and change management processes. For routine tasks, we 
perform comprehensive risk assessments based on HIRA framework and implement

For non-routine tasks, we adhere to a permit-to-work process, which involves identifying 
potential hazards associated with the work and establishing controls to eliminate or

Prompt reporting to the designated team is crucial. This proactive approach is reinforced by 
the EHS department through comprehensive safety training, including awareness videos, 
posters, and other educational materials. Upon receiving a hazard report, the responsible 
team promptly implements necessary measures to address and mitigate the risk, and these 
actions are clearly communicated to the workers. Supervisor/ Labour contractor is a part of 
the EHS committee at each operational site, who is responsible for circulating the minutes of 
meeting to the ground force/ workmen, capacitating them on health and safety measures.

which provides for cashless treatment at our network hospitals nationwide. Workers 
are protected by a comprehensive workmen's compensation policy. Emergency helpline 
numbers are prominently displayed on-site to facilitate immediate access in case of 
incidents.
In the event of an emergency, we coordinate with the HR department to arrange for 
prompt transportation to the nearest affiliated hospital for treatment. Additionally, we have 
allocated a budget for initial medical treatment at the site for injured workers. We also 
organize regular medical health check-up camps at our project locations to offer free health 
screenings to both employees and workers. Moreover, a fully equipped first-aid center is 
available at each project camp to address immediate medical needs.

in this process.
DBL has completely replaced 
natural 
sand 
with 
its 
manufactured 
sand, 
resulting 
in 
savings 
of 
approximately 
1,682,829.297 metric tons.

deployed solar panels at various project sites nationwide.
In the fiscal year 2023-24, DBL 
successfully generated 2,148,673 
units of solar power, achieving 
substantial savings amounting to 
INR 6,087,807 in energy costs.
4.
Geo 
Green 
Initiative
DBL's Geo Green initiative aims to mitigate soil erosion alongside road

construction process. By prioritizing energy efficiency and minimizing 
environmental impact, DBL actively addresses soil erosion concerns 
along under-construction roads.
Approximately 
424,183 
plants 
have been planted across DBL 
projects, 
with 
an 
associated 
cost of approximately 1.75 crore 
rupees, aimed at combating soil 
erosion.
