your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices

Continuing our commitment to sustainable practices, the company adheres to government guidelines for the disposal of 
all hazardous waste. We are dedicated to minimising waste generation and disposal by embracing the “5 R’s” principle: 
Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Repurpose, and Recycle wherever feasible. Various initiatives have been implemented to 
support this commitment. In our Palm plantation business, solid waste such as Empty Fruit Bunches (EFB), fibre, and 
shells are utilised as organic fertiliser and fuel. Liquid waste, Palm Oil Mill Effluent (POME), generated from processing 
fresh fruit bunches are also managed sustainably. Similarly, in the Oleo Chemicals business, by-products from the 
processing of edible oils serve as primary feedstock, contributing to our waste management strategy.
