Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues
 
Material responsible business conduct and sustainability issues pertaining to environmental and social 
matters that present a risk or an opportunity to your business, rationale for identifying the same, approach 
to adapt or mitigate the risk along-with its financial implications
 
Company’s Approach: Conducting a Materiality Assessment to identify issues needing focus and prioritization 
is a critical step in a company’s sustainability journey. As a subsidiary of the CIE Automotive Group, CIE India 
has aligned its material issues to that identified by its parent company. We have further honed these issues 
to cater to the country-specific needs of CIE India. The identified material issues have served as our guide in 
understanding stakeholder expectations, setting targets, and undertaking relevant initiatives that will enable us 
to continue delivering long-term value to our customers, shareholders, employees, and communities.

Social Matters
1.
Attracting and 
retaining talent
Risk
Management of the current and 
projected pace of growth requires 
consolidation and development 
of the company’s finest asset, its 
people.
The need to continuously hire, 
train and retain professionals is 
set to remain a major challenge 
in the years to come. High staff 
turnover makes it hard to operate 
at normal levels and achieve the 
company’s targets.
That is why it is fundamental 
to agree a unified training and 
promotion plan with the aim 
of 
planning, 
appraising 
and 
enhancing professionals’ current 
and future skillsets so as to 
facilitate delivery of Company’s 
strategic objectives.
The Company is continually improving its 
employment terms and conditions to make 
them induce for its existing people and to 
attract new talent to the organization.
Factory 
managers 
and 
HR 
managers 
periodically assess the situation at their 
factories for the risk of losing talent, especially 
in critical positions, and take the measures 
required to retain key talent and plan for 
succession as needed.
In accordance with our Employee Value 
Proposition (EVP), we have rolled out career 
development programs for employees through 
Individual Development Action Plans (IDAPs). 
The focus is to upskill the workforce and 
create internal opportunities in terms of career 
progression for our employees. Coaching has 
been introduced in the organization; senior 
managers have been trained as coaches who 
in turn coach the employees on their IDAPs.
The financial 
implication of 
the risk cannot 
be quantified. 
However, in 
case the risk is 
materialized, the 
impact will be 
negative.

Customer 
Satisfaction
Risk as 
well as 
Opportunity
Challenges in management of 
new projects and/or operations 
could lead to failure to attain 
the defined specifications and, 
possibly, breaches of contract.
(e.g., delivery times, milestones, or 
quality).
The Company places a strong emphasis 
on customer responsiveness, with a focus 
on meeting customer expectations at every 
stage of the business relationship. Several key 
business processes contribute to ensuring 
customer satisfaction:
Sales Process: sales process is designed to 
effectively search for and secure new business 
with the overarching goal of customer 
satisfaction. The company analyzes customer 
requirements, specifications, and needs during 
this phase. Technical, quality, and supply chain 
reviews are conducted with the customer 
to ensure proposals align with customer 
expectations.
Both Positive and 
Negative.

Launch and Industrialization: If the company 
secures new business, it ensures that the 
launch and industrialization of the project 
meet the highest standards. This includes 
the use of control tools such as product 
and 
process 
Failure 
Mode 
and 
Effects 
Analysis (FMEA), product and manufacturing 
validations, 
control 
plans, 
prototype 
launches, samples, and ongoing revision 
of customer specifications, with a focus on 
special characteristics and regulatory and 
safety considerations.
Mass Supply: Once the agreed launch 
standards are attained, mass supply begins, 
framed 
by 
procedures 
and 
tools 
that 
comprise set processes. These processes 
are aligned with stringent sector standards 
and 
undergo 
continuous 
internal 
and 
third-party audits.
The company’s commitment to customer 
satisfaction extends beyond these specific 
processes. It involves various group-wide 
processes that contribute to ensuring customer 
satisfaction, knowledge transfer to projects, 
the availability of top-quality suppliers, and 
the effective use of people, resources, and 
technology to meet customer demands. This 
comprehensive approach reflects a customer-
centric mindset and a dedication to delivering 
high-quality products and services.

Occupational 
Health and 
Safety
Risk
The management have ensured 
that the people are working in 
a safe environment. Even the 
machines/equipment 
procured 
are not only proven for process 
consistencies but are also proven 
to ensure safety requirements. 
The management have taken 
every possible step to provide 
training to the workmen. However, 
the complexities arises since 
we are working in a dynamic 
scenario 
where 
people 
and 
machines undergo changes and 
hence the most important aspect 
is discipline, which is why this is 
identified as a Risk.
As The company places a strong emphasis 
on health and safety for all its people working 
at all our manufacturing & offices. And 
implemented ISO 45001 certification for all its 
25 manufacturing locations except 1 location 
which will be certified in CY 2024.
Continuous improvement of safety culture 
is acknowledged as a journey, and the 
management is actively involved in upgrading 
processes and procedures across all plants. 
Monitoring 
progress 
and 
adherence 
to 
safety standards, along with behavior-based 
trainings, are integral to this journey.

Circular 
Economy – 
efficient use of 
raw material 
and waste 
management
Opportunity
Steel as a raw material is highest 
associated volume of use as 
well as waste which may not be 
recycled in full within companies’ 
factories. 
Responsibility 
for 
waste generation does not end 
when that waste is removed 
from Company’s facilities. To 
that end, in addition to its waste 
minimization plans, it must devise 
an efficient waste classification 
system thereby seeking to reduce 
its environmental impact.
The CIE Automotive Group’s commitment to 
moving towards a circular model signifies a 
proactive stance toward sustainability and 
environmental 
responsibility. 
Several 
key 
points highlight the Company’s efforts in 
this direction:
Reduction in Raw Material, Water, and Energy 
Consumption: The Company is actively 
working to reduce raw material, water, and 
energy consumption. This aligns with the 
principles of a circular economy, emphasizing 
the importance of minimizing resource use 
and maximizing efficiency.
Waste 
Reduction: 
The 
circular 
model 
approach involves efforts to minimize waste 
year after year. This indicates a commitment 
to not only efficient resource utilization but 
also to reducing the environmental impact 
associated with waste generation.
Action across the value chain: The Company’s 
commitment extends across its entire value 
chain, indicating a comprehensive approach 
to sustainability. This includes considering the 
environmental impact of operations from the 
procurement of raw materials to products exit 
from gate.
Energy Efficiency Measures: The introduction 
of energy efficiency measures throughout 
processes and facilities is a strategic move. 
This not only helps minimize the environmental 
impact but also contributes to reducing 
energy costs, showcasing a dual benefit of 
sustainability and cost-effectiveness.
Projects for Optimization and Efficiency: 
The Company has been actively undertaking 
projects to optimize the use of raw materials 
and increase efficiency. This reflects a 
commitment to continuous improvement and 
innovation in line with sustainability projects & 
goals.
By aligning its operations with the principles 
of a circular economy, the Company is 
positioning itself as a responsible corporate 
entity actively contributing to environmental 
conservation and resource efficiency. The 
focus on energy efficiency, waste reduction, 
and 
optimization 
projects 
collectively 
demonstrates a commitment to sustainable 
practices throughout the business.

New forms of 
mobility
Risk as 
well as 
Opportunity
Electrification of powertrains has 
seen rapid adoption in Europe 
with share of battery electric 
vehicles (EVs) in the light vehicles 
segment reaching 12% in CY23 
and expected to reach 48% by 
CY2028. In India, the transition to 
electric mobility is expected to be 
more gradual especially in 4W 
though certain segments like 3W 
and 2W may see rapid adoption 
of EVs. The highest risk arising 
from this transition to EVs is at 
our forging plants. Both in India & 
Europe, the Company is a market 
leader in key internal combustion 
engine parts like crankshafts. 
Such 
parts 
are 
at 
risk 
of 
obsolescence when EVs become 
mainstream. As the exposure to 
such parts in Europe is higher 
and the pace of transition to EVs 
more rapid, the risk to sales for our 
European business is significant. 
We also have a clear action plan 
to alleviate this risk. In India, given 
the slow introduction of 4W EV´s, 
our lower exposure on engine 
parts and a good order book for 
EV parts, for local and exports, 
we see the risks of EV transition 
in India being minimal, rather we 
think it is more of an opportunity. 
As the supplier ecosystem of EVs 
is at a nascent stage, EV OEMs are 
looking to partner with suppliers 
who have quality and pedigree. 
Therefore, 
as 
a 
high-quality 
supplier of automotive parts, we 
consider the transition to EVs to be 
more of an opportunity than a risk.
The risk posed by electrification is higher in 
our European operations and our mitigation 
plan in Europe is to substitute production 
of crankshafts by Aluminum forged parts 
and steel parts that will not be affected by 
transition to electric vehicles. We have got 
interesting new orders on those, and some 
of them are already in production in our 
plants. In addition, the Gears plant in Europe 
is developing a healthy order book in electric 
vehicle transmission parts. In India, transition 
to EVs is more an opportunity than a risk. Our EV 
order book in India is spread across aluminum 
& 
steel 
castings, 
steel 
forgings, 
gears, 
stampings, and composite parts for e2W, 
e3W and e4W segments. We are investing to 
expand capacity in India to meet the EV order 
book requirements.  Our diversified technology, 
product and customer portfolio allows us to 
address the requirements and risks emerging 
from EV transition in an effective manner.  We 
are working with major European and Indian 
OEMs and Tier 1s in the EV space across vehicle 
segments. We plan to remain agile enough to 
adapt to future customer needs and emerging 
trends.

The Company has adopted the Global Policy of CIE Group on Human Rights, demonstrating a formal commitment

rights standards and its own Human Rights Policy.

to decent work and a living wage, in either 2023 or 2022. This absence of complaints suggests a proactive approach 
to maintaining a workplace environment that upholds human rights standards and aligns with the United Nations 
Declaration. It reflects positively on the company’s commitment to ethical and responsible business practices.

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases
 
The Company has adopted CIE Automotive’s protocol for preventing and handling workplace harassment.
 
The protocol encompasses the prevention of mobbing, sexual harassment, and gender harassment, incorporating 
various preventive measures such as zero-tolerance towards harassment, shared employee responsibility for 
monitoring workplace conduct, and the establishment of communication programs. The Harassment Protocol 
is accessible on the CIE Automotive website for consultation, demonstrating transparency and accessibility.
 
Moreover, in accordance with the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition, and 
Redressal) Act of 2013, the Company has formulated a Policy on the Prevention of Sexual Harassment for Women 
at the Workplace. This policy is applicable to all employees, including permanent, contract, temporary, and 
trainees. To address accusations of sexual harassment, the Company has established an Internal Committee 
(IC), aligning with legal requirements.
 
The Code of Professional Conduct enables the submission of inquiries or notifications, including those related to 
harassment, anonymously. The Compliance Department handles and analyzes such notifications and inquiries 
confidentially.
 
Both the harassment policies and the whistle-blower policy provide mechanisms for the protection of 
complainants and whistle-blowers. The company explicitly condemns any form of discrimination, harassment, 
victimization, or unfair employment practices against whistle-blowers. This commitment includes complete 
protection against retaliation, threats, intimidation, or any other unfair practices that may hinder the whistle-
blower’s right to continue performing their duties or making further protected disclosures. This comprehensive 
approach reinforces a commitment to creating a safe and respectful workplace environment.

the generation and disposal records are diligently maintained for every waste category, adhering to consent 
and applicable requirements.
 
Waste disposal and recycling procedures follow the stipulated consent and rule requirements, directing waste 
to Common Hazardous Waste Storage, Treatment, and Disposal facilities, authorized recyclers, or agencies. 
The company ensures compliance with these regulations, and annual returns are filed as per consent and 
applicable rule requirements.
 
To enhance environmental awareness and compliance, the company conducts training and awareness 
programs for individuals involved in the handling, storage, and disposal of waste at regular intervals. Specifically, 
hazardous and toxic chemicals are handled by trained personnel in accordance with their Safety Data Sheets 
(SDS). Additionally, the company focuses on reducing the consumption of these substances, aligning with 
specific process requirements. This comprehensive waste management strategy reflects the company’s 
commitment to environmental responsibility and regulatory compliance.

Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan? Give details in 100 words/ web 
link.
 
The Business Continuity Plan (BCP) of the Company is an integral part of its Risk Management Policy. Each 
manufacturing unit of the Company has a disaster management plan in place, designed to ensure compliance 
with applicable laws and prioritize the protection of assets and the well-being of individuals. The primary 
objective of these plans is to ensure the continuity of key business processes in the aftermath of a disaster, be it 
caused by natural or man-made events.
 
To facilitate effective emergency preparedness, an Emergency Preparedness manual is available at each plant 
of the Company. This manual includes crucial information such as: (a) Emergency preparedness procedures, 
(b) List of potential emergencies, (c) Details of chemical and fuel storage, (d) Information about the fire-fighting 
system, (e) Emergency Response Team (ERT), (f) General communication flow charts for both working and 
non-working hours, (g) Instructions to be followed during emergencies, (h) Incident investigation procedures, 
(i) Roles of ERT members,
Annual Report 2023

Regular mock drills are conducted to educate employees on appropriate responses during emergencies. These 
measures collectively ensure that the Company is well-prepared to handle unexpected disruptions and can 
swiftly resume its key business operations.
6. 
Disclose any significant adverse impact to the environment, arising from the value chain of the entity. What 
mitigation or adaptation measures have been taken by the entity in this regard.
 
The Company states that it does not perceive any substantial adverse impacts on the environment arising from 
its value chain. It conducts impact assessments for all potential risks and takes necessary actions to mitigate 
these risks. As part of the vendor registration process, the Company obtains ESG (Environmental, Social, and 
Governance) commitment declarations from all value chain partners.
7. 
Percentage of value chain partners (by value of business done with such partners) that were assessed for 
environmental impacts.
 
The Company has implemented a Suppliers ESG Criterion Evaluation, requiring suppliers to conduct self-
assessments of their compliance with Principle 7, Principle 8, and Principle 9 of the UN Global Compact, specifically 
addressing environmental commitments. Notably, 100% of the Company’s suppliers have completed the self-
assessment and expressed their commitment to comply with these principles.
 
However, it’s important to note that as of the provided information, no independent assessment has been carried 
out to evaluate the environmental impacts of the company’s value chain partners. While the self-assessment 
by suppliers is a positive step, independent assessments could provide an additional layer of scrutiny and 
verification regarding the environmental practices throughout the value chain. Independent assessments can 
enhance transparency and credibility in evaluating and addressing environmental impacts.
PRINCIPLE 7: Businesses, when engaging in influencing public and regulatory policy, should do so in a manner that 
is responsible and transparent
The Company operates its business within the national and international legislative and policy framework and does 
not engage in influencing public and regulatory policy. Instead, it encourages complete cooperation and diligence 
from every individual during inspections, information requests, or procedures that Public Authorities may deem 
necessary.
The Company may become members of trade and industry chambers or associations and other similar collective 
platforms. These memberships provide avenues for conveying industry concerns to policy makers. This collaborative 
approach allows the Company to participate in industry dialogue and contribute to the development of policies that 
impact its sector.

PRINCIPLE 9: Businesses should engage with and provide value to their consumers in a responsible manner
The Company provides Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and their tier-1 suppliers with the parts they need, 
precisely when and how they need them, aiming to generate value as framed by its Quality Policy. Throughout 2023, it 
continued to respond to its customers’ requirements with multi-technology solutions designed to satisfy diverse needs. 
Customer satisfaction is driven by continuous product and process improvement through prevention, systematic 
revision, training, and know-how sharing, as outlined in the group’s Global Quality Policy. The policy demonstrates 
the Company’s dual strategic commitment to quality and environmental protection, in harmony with its customers’ 
concerns.
Essential Indicators

relationship process. This commitment spans from the initial sales pitch and effective project management to 
ensuring timely production and service delivery. In the event of any deviations, the Company promptly responds, 
and it actively seeks feedback. Given its lack of direct interaction with end consumers, the Company doesn’t 
employ proprietary customer grievance management systems. Instead, it handles claims and complaints 
received from its customers, including OEMs and TIER-1 suppliers, in adherence to the standard operating 
procedures prevalent in the automotive industry to which it belongs.
