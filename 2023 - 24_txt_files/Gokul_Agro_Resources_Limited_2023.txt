1
Greenhouse 
Gas 
Emissions
Opportunity
Entities in the Agricultural Products 
industry directly emit greenhouse 
gases (GHG) through the processing 
and transportation of goods via 
land and sea freight. As emissions 
regulations tighten, these entities could 
face higher capital and operational 
costs, 
potentially 
impacting 
their 
efficiency. 
However, 
by 
adopting 
innovative technologies that utilize 
alternative fuels and energy sources—
such as biomass waste from their own 
processes—and by enhancing fuel 
efficiency, these entities can mitigate 
risks associated with fluctuating fuel 
prices, supply disruptions, regulatory 
expenses 
and 
other 
GHG-related 
challenges. Converting this risk into 
opportunity, Gokul Agro has been able 
considerably reduce the air emissions 
& Scope 1 GHG emissions, as is 
evident from disclosures in principle 6.

2
Energy 
Management
Risk
Processing and milling agricultural 
products demand significant energy 
input. While some agricultural product 
entities produce energy on-site by 
burning fossil fuels or biomass, 
most rely on electricity from the grid. 
This energy use has environmental 
impacts, including contributions to 
climate change and pollution. Effective 
energy management is crucial as it 
influences both current and future 
operational costs. Climate regulations 
and sustainability factors may lead 
to higher or more volatile electricity 
and fuel prices, thereby increasing 
operating expenses for these entities. 
Improving energy efficiency through 
process enhancements can reduce 
these costs. The decision between 
using on-site versus grid-sourced 
electricity and adopting alternative 
energy sources can significantly affect 
the long-term cost, reliability of energy 
supply, and the extent of regulatory 
impacts from direct versus indirect 
emissions.
To mitigate energy management 
risks, 
the 
Company 
has 
implemented 
a 
strategy 
that 
includes 
an 
automatic 
thermometer cut-off system, solar 
panels and windmills. The cut-off 
system prevents energy wastage 
by shutting down cooling devices 
at the desired temperature. Solar 
panels and windmills diversify 
energy sources, reducing reliance 
on 
conventional 
energy 
and 
mitigating 
supply 
fluctuations 
and rising costs. This approach 
enhances 
energy 
efficiency 
and 
supports 
environmental 
sustainability 
by 
lowering 
the 
carbon footprint.
The Company is ISO 9001:2015 
certified, 
demonstrating 
its 
commitment 
to 
high-quality 
management systems.
Negative
(There has been no 
negative impact in 
the FY 23-24)
3
Workforce 
Health and 
Safety
Risk
The 
Industrial 
processes 
in 
the 
Agricultural Products industry come 
with significant occupational hazards. 
Employees often engage in labor-
intensive tasks that pose risks such 
as falls, transportation accidents, 
equipment-related injuries, and heat-
related illnesses. Failing to adhere 
to health and safety standards can 
lead to regulatory penalties and the 
costs of corrective actions. High injury 
and fatality rates may indicate weak 
governance and a poor workplace 
safety culture, potentially causing 
substantial reputational damage.
The Company has adopted a 
comprehensive 
Environmental, 
Health, 
and 
Safety 
(EHS) 
management system across all 
operations. It is ISO 45001:2018 
certified.
The 
Company 
has 
also 
implemented 
thorough 
training 
programs for all employees and 
workers on safe working practices 
and also extends health and 
accidental policies/ benefits to its 
workforce.

Water 
Management
Risk
The Agricultural Products industry 
depends on water for processing 
activities 
and 
typically 
produces 
wastewater or effluent. The availability 
of water, whether due to physical 
scarcity 
or 
regulatory 
limitations, 
directly affects the industry’s ability to 
efficiently operate processing facilities. 
Due to water scarcity globally entities 
in this industry are increasingly facing 
water-related risks and regulations, 
which could lead to higher capital 
expenditures, operating costs and 
remediation expenses.
To manage effluent at the site, water 
from various sources, including 
GWIL and bore wells, undergoes a 
comprehensive treatment process. 
After 
initial 
use, 
wastewater 
from operations is collected and 
treated in the Effluent Treatment 
Plant (ETP). The ETP processes 
the 
wastewater 
to 
remove 
contaminants, making it suitable for 
reuse. Additionally, the site employs 
a Multiple Effect Evaporation (MEE) 
plant, which further concentrates 
and 
reduces 
the 
volume 
of 
waste, ensuring efficient water 
management. Treated water from 
these processes is reused for 
non-potable applications, such as 
gardening and cooling towers, to 
minimize fresh water consumption.
Negative
(There has been no 
negative impact in 
the FY 2023-24)
5
Food safety
Risk
Agricultural products are either sold 
directly to consumers in their raw form 
or undergo processing beforehand. 
Ensuring product quality and safety 
is 
crucial, 
as 
contamination 
by 
pathogens, chemicals or spoilage 
poses serious health risks to humans 
and animals. Contamination can occur 
due to inadequate farming, transport, 
storage or handling practices. Issues 
with food quality and safety can lead 
to shifts in demand and regulatory 
actions. Product recalls can damage 
brand reputation, decrease revenues 
and incur substantial fines.
Our company ensures the highest 
standards of food safety and quality 
through rigorous processes. The 
Company verify the quality of raw 
materials before unloading, clean 
and destone solid materials, and 
filter liquid cargo through magnetic 
strainers. The refining process 
uses appropriate aids and steam, 
adhering to established procedures. 
All employees are medically certified 
to prevent human contamination 
and maintain strict hygiene in 
the 
production 
area 
through 
regular 
cleaning. 
Pest 
control 
services are regularly employed to 
manage pests. Our well-equipped 
lab conducts thorough quality 
checks in compliance with FSSAI 
norms, including biannual testing 
for pesticides, NOTs (Naturally 
Occurring 
Toxins), 
and 
heavy 
metals. Additionally, the Company 
is ISO 9001:2015 certified, thereby 
ensuring quality of the products.

Environmental 
& Social 
Impacts of 
Ingredient 
Supply Chain
Risk
Agricultural 
products 
entities 
source their inputs from numerous 
suppliers. How these entities address 
environmental and social issues with 
their suppliers can influence consumer 
demand, reputational risks and their 
ability to manage crop supply and 
respond to price fluctuations. Issues 
in supply chain management, such 
as labor practices, environmental 
standards, ethics or corruption, can 
lead to regulatory fines or higher long-
term operational costs. Additionally, 
poor performance by suppliers on 
environmental or social issues can 
damage the entity’s reputation. By 
collaborating with key suppliers to 
implement 
sustainable 
agricultural 
practices or sourcing from certified 
suppliers, entities can mitigate these 
risks, potentially boost consumer 
demand and access new market 
opportunities.
To mitigate the environmental and 
social impacts of our ingredient 
supply 
chain, 
the 
Company 
integrates 
the 
concept 
of 
circularity throughout its supply 
chain and product lifecycle. This 
strategy 
focuses 
on 
resource 
optimization by minimizing waste 
during production through efficient 
processes and technologies. The 
Company is committed to utilizing 
recycled materials in our packaging, 
reducing 
reliance 
on 
virgin 
resources and our environmental 
footprint. Additionally, the Company 
develops products designed for 
reuse or repurposing, extending 
their lifecycle and reducing waste. 
These 
initiatives 
collectively 
aim to create a sustainable and 
responsible 
supply 
chain 
that 
addresses 
environmental 
and 
social challenges while promoting 
a circular economy.

Corporate 
Governance
Opportunity
Establishing a strong and clearly 
defined 
governance 
structure 
is 
essential 
for 
ensuring 
effective 
decision-making 
and 
operational 
management within an organization. 
This framework offers transparent 
guidelines 
and 
procedures 
for 
decision-making, 
thereby 
aligning 
the organization’s actions with its 
strategic objectives. Our Company 
upholds a steadfast commitment to 
accountability to its stakeholders, 
actively advocating for fair, transparent 
and ethical corporate governance 
practices. Recognizing that sound 
corporate governance is vital for the 
Company’s growth, profitability and 
stability, The Company emphasizes 
the importance of a robust and 
transparent governance framework to 
cultivate trust with stakeholders.
