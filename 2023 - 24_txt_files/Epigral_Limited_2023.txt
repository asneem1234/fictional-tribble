Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report
(Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) is the practice of companies disclosing information 
about their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance. It goes beyond financial reporting to 
provide stakeholders with a comprehensive view of a company's non-financial impacts and contributions to 
sustainable development. BRSR covers topics such as environmental impact, social responsibility, and governance 
practices, aiming to promote transparency and accountability.)

Sustainable 
Supply Chain
O
In today's era of growing envi-
ronmental awareness, compa-
nies are adopting more ethical 
and sustainable purchasing pol-
icies. By procuring goods that 
are environmentally and socially 
responsible, companies can not 
only reduce their impact on the 
environment but also create a 
positive brand image.
 -
Positive
2
Emission 
and Pollutants
R
Chemical production produces 
direct (Scope 1) greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions from 
fossil fuel burning in manufac-
turing and cogeneration 
processes and process 
emissions from feedstock 
trans-formation. In addition 
to greenhouse gases (GHGs). 
Chemical manufacturing may 
also emit air emissions such 
as sulphur dioxides (SOx), 
nitrogen oxides (NOx), and 
hazardous air pollutants during 
manufacturing. For chemical 
firms, emissions might result 
in operating risks, fines, or 
expenditures associated with 
regulatory compliance. 
We acknowledge the significance 
of minimizing our carbon footprint 
and uphold our environmental 
responsibility with utmost serious-
ness. Our company is dedicated to 
integrating sustainable practices and 
consistently endeavors to diminish 
energy usage by embracing inno-
vative technologies. Moreover, we 
are actively investigating methods 
to procure energy from renewable 
sources to diminish our depend-
ence on non-renewable resources 
further. In line with our commitment 
to clean energy production and re-
ducing our carbon footprint, we are 
excited about establishing an 18.34 
MW wind-solar hybrid project. We 
are also embracing modern technol-
ogies like ECH - Glycerol technology, 
which consumes less energy and wa-
ter while generating minimal waste.

Circular 
Economy
O
The Circular Economy model of 
production and consumption 
emphasizes and promotes 
the reuse, refurbishment, and 
recycling of materials and 
products already in existence. 
Transition to circular economy 
can reduce the material 
consumption during the 
production.
 -
Positive
4
Water  
Management
R
Water is a critical input 
in chemical production. 
Companies with water intensive 
operations face a greater 
risk of operational disruption 
due to water scarcity, which 
can also increase water 
procurement prices and 
capital expenditures. Similarly, 
chemical manufacturing 
generates process wastewater 
that must be treated before 
disposal. Non-compliance with 
water quality regulations may 
result in regulatory compliance 
and mitigation costs.
As a conscientious chemical 
manufacturing entity, we prioritize 
the capacity to regulate water usage. 
Advanced wastewater treatment 
technology significantly reduces our 
environmental impact by minimizing 
water and energy consumption. We 
go beyond treatment with diverse 
water conservation initiatives. 
Collected rinse water from specific 
units is treated and reused in 
cooling towers. A condensate 
recovery system captures water 
for boiler makeup. Additionally, 
sewage treatment plants provide 
irrigation water, eliminating reliance 
on freshwater for landscaping. 
These initiatives showcase our 
commitment to responsible water 
stewardship.
Negative
5
Handling  
Hazardous  
Chemicals
R
Chemical company is 
responsible for managing all 
risks related to the storage 
and handling of hazardous 
chemicals. The improper 
handling of chemicals and 
spills can cause harm to the 
environment or humans and 
also imposes a heavy fine 
and reputational risk on the 
company.
The company places a strong 
emphasis on the responsible 
handling of hazardous materials to 
minimize risks to the environment, 
employees, and the surrounding 
community. To uphold health and 
safety standards in the workplace, 
the company regularly conducts 
comprehensive internal and external 
health and safety audits. Additionally, 
relevant en-vironmental and social 
parameters associated with our 
products are disclosed to customers. 
In the management of hazardous 
waste, the company adheres strictly 
to waste management rules and 
regulations to ensure proper disposal 
and minimize environmental impact.

Waste 
Management
R
Typically, waste is generated 
as part of a company's 
operations, captive power plant, 
maintenance of machinery 
and office administrative work. 
Improper waste handling may 
contribute to air pollution, 
climate change, and various 
direct and indirect impacts 
on the ecosystem. It may also 
cause health and safety risks to 
personnel exposed to the waste. 
Non-compliance with waste 
management regulations may 
lead to the imposing of heavy 
fines.
The company has implemented 
several new technologies to replace 
existing processes, resulting in a 
reduction in waste generation. 
This strategic replacement has not 
only minimized the consumption 
of natural resources but also 
decreased waste generation and 
the need for open land waste 
disposal. Additionally, the company 
has taken a proactive step by 
registering for Extended Producer 
Responsibility (EPR), demonstrating 
its commitment to managing 
the plastic waste generated by its 
products and packaging.
Negative
7
Community 
Relation and 
 Enagagement
O
Chemical firms are significant 
economic contributors, 
offering employment 
opportunities and fostering 
community devel-opment 
through taxes and capital 
generation. Environmental 
policy, community health, and 
process safety have signifi-cant 
regulatory, operational, financial, 
and reputational ramifications 
for companies. Building strong 
relationships with communities 
can help chemicals companies 
mitigate potential operational 
disruption, reduce regulatory 
risk, retain top employees, lower 
the risk of litigation expenses 
in the event of process safety 
incidents, and ensure a strong 
social license to operate. Process 
safety incidents jeopardies 
community health and safety, 
resulting in regulatory penalties, 
legal action, and mitigating 
expenses.

Product  
Innovation
R
The chemical industry has the 
potential to impact human 
health and the environment. 
So, the industry can reduce 
regula-tory risk and grow its 
market share by coming up 
with innovative approaches to 
manage the potential impact of 
the product by developing an 
alternate product or reducing 
toxicity.
To stay ahead as the top player in 
the chemical industry, our company 
is all about pushing the boundaries 
of product innovation. We're not 
just focused on new products; 
we're also innovating at the process 
level to make sure our production 
is sustainable. As a key step in this 
direction, we're setting up an R&D 
center dedicated to pushing the 
limits and creating ground breaking 
products.

Diversity 
and Equal

R
A company’s high diversity and 
inclusion rate reflect employees' 
sense of belonging and fairness 
within the company. Improving 
diversity and inclusion 
helps companies to support 
vulnerable groups resulting 
in community brand image 
creation for the company.
We prioritize fostering a diverse 
and inclusive work environment to 
boost productivity and creativity 
among our employees. Our 
commitment to being an equal 
opportunity employer is reflected 
in our policies that apply to every 
aspect of employment, including 
recruitment, hiring, promotions, 
transfers, compensation, benefits, 
and termination.
Negative
10
Product Safety 
& Quality
R
Product safety and quality is 
a critical issue for companies 
in the Chemicals  industry. 
Chemicals’ potential to have  
negative effects on human 
health or the environment 
throughout the usage 
phase can affect consumer 
demand for the product and 
regulatory risk, which can 
then damage sales and lead 
to higher operational costs, 
regulatory compliance costs, 
and mitigation
In order to guarantee the safety 
of our products, we include 
environmental and social 
parameters pertinent to the 
product, such as guidelines for safe 
and responsible usage, recycling 
information, or instructions for safe 
disposal, on the product packaging. 
Additionally, our plant is equipped 
with quality laboratories to ensure 
the maintenance of product quality. 
We’ve made investments in a range 
of standard operating protocols 
and certifications, including ISO 
9001 and ISO 14001, which 
reinforce our commitment to 
Quality Management Systems, 
Good Manufacturing Practices, and 
Standard Operating Procedures. This 
strengthens the company’s overall 
alignment with industry standards 
and best practices.

Compliance 
and Business  
Ethics
R
The key issue relevant 
to business ethics and 
management of business ethics 
issues such as fraud, executive 
misconduct, corrupt practices, 
money laundering, or anti-trust 
violations. Ethics violations can 
lead to police investigations, 
hefty fines, settlement costs, 
and damage to reputation.
Our goal is to apply risk mitigation 
systematically across various risk 
categories within a robust risk 
management framework that 
encompasses policy formulation, 
procedural guidelines, and 
comprehensive assessment 
methodologies. This strategic 
approach has significantly 
contributed to en-hancing process 
stability, improving operational 
outcomes, and fostering corporate 
sustainability.

If Yes, provide details in brief
At Epigral Ltd, we maintain a stringent zero-tolerance stance towards 
corruption within our business operations. Corruption, particularly in 
the form of bribery, is defined as the offering or provision of anything 
of value—such as cash, gifts, meals, travel, or entertainment with 
the intent of securing an improper advantage or benefit. We strictly 
prohibit the act of offering or accepting bribes from any entity, 
whether they are public officials or private individuals.
This anti-bribery policy extends not only to our employees but also to 
third parties acting on our behalf, including suppliers, subcontractors, 
and other business partners. It is imperative to understand that 
these standards apply equally to all our relationships. If Epigral Ltd is 
barred from participating in a specific activity, the same limitations 
are imposed on our third-party associates.
Our steadfast commitment to combating corruption and 
bribery underscores our unwavering dedication to upholding 
the highest levels of ethics and integrity across all facets of our 
business engagements.

Does the entity have processes in place

If Yes, provide details of the same.
Yes
The Company has established a code of conduct for its board 
of directors and key managerial personnel (KMP), mandating 
them to abstain from any business, relationship, or activity that 
could potentially conflict with the Company’s interests. To ensure 
transparency, the Company collects declarations from its board 
members and senior management annually or upon any change, 
disclosing their concerns or interests in other companies, bodies 
corporate, firms, or associations of individuals, including changes 
in shareholding. 
Furthermore, during board and/or committee meetings, directors 
abstain from participating in discussions or decisions related to 
matters in which they have a vested interest or concern. To manage 
and monitor conflicts of interest involving directors and KMPs 
effectively, the Company Affairs team maintains a comprehensive 
database listing the directors and their affiliations. This information 
is shared with the Finance department, which then flags relevant 
parties in their system to monitor and track transactions entered by 
the Company with these parties.
PRINCIPLE 2 
Businesses should provide goods and services in a manner that is sustainable and safe.
(This principle highlights the importance of sustainable and safe production practices. Companies should strive 
to minimize the environmental impact of their activities and ensure that their products and services are safe for

The company places the safety and well-being of its employees 
at the forefront of its operations. This commitment is reflected 
in the implementation of a robust Occupational Health and 
Safety Management System (OHSMS) that is seamlessly 
integrated into all business processes.
Our OHSMS transcends mere compliance. It leverages a 
holistic framework that incorporates best practices from 
established standards like ISO 45001 (Occupational 
Health and Safety Management Systems) and ISO 14001 
(Environmental Management Systems). Additionally, process 
safety management and responsible care management 
systems are woven into the framework. This comprehensive 
approach ensures that safety remains a top priority across 
the entire supply chain, encompassing all departments and 
technical systems, the company actively fosters a culture of 
safety through various initiatives.

10.	 Health and safety management system
Engaging safety awareness campaigns keep safety at the 
forefront of employees’ minds. Comprehensive safety and 
health training equips employees with the knowledge and 
skills necessary to work safely. Regular safety meetings provide 
a platform for open discussions and collaboration on safety 
issues. Healthy competition through safety competitions 
reinforces key safety principles. Inter-plant training fosters 
the sharing of knowledge and best practices across locations, 
strengthening the overall safety posture of the company. Finally, 
the company encourages employees to report near misses, 
unsafe acts, and unsafe conditions. This proactive approach 
allows for the identification and mitigation of potential hazards 
before they escalate into incidents. 
Clearly visible health and safety signage displayed at all 
company sites serves as a constant reminder of safety 
protocols. These signs ensure that established procedures are 
followed consistently, further promoting a safe and healthy 
work environment for all employees. 
By implementing these comprehensive measures, the 
company demonstrates its unwavering commitment to 
creating a workplace where safety is not just a priority, but a 
core value embedded in every aspect of its operations
b.	 What are the processes used to identify work-
related hazards and assess risks on a routine 
and non-routine basis by the entity?
Ensuring the safety and well-being of employees is a top 
priority in any workplace. To achieve this, a proactive approach 
to identifying and mitigating potential hazards and risks is 
essential.
Several effective processes can be utilized to safeguard 
employee well-being. 
HAZOP (Hazard and Operability Analysis) is a systematic 
assessment conducted at plant sites, both internally and 
by external experts. This collaborative approach rigorously 
analyzes potential operational hazards and develops strategies 
to address them
JSA (Job Safety Analysis) takes a more individualised approach. 
This process is directly integrated into work procedures, 
ensuring employees receive thorough training on potential 
hazards associated with their specific tasks and how to 
mitigate them. Empowering employees to work safely and 
proactively identify risks in their daily routines strengthens the 
overall safety culture within an organisation.
When a new building or plant is constructed, a PSSR (Pre-
Startup Safety Review) is conducted. This crucial process 
ensures all necessary safety measures are in place and 
implemented correctly through a comprehensive review of 
safety procedures. By proactively addressing potential issues 
before operations begin, PSSR significantly reduces risks 
associated with new facilities.
Finally, a Permit to Work (PTW) Management System fosters 
a culture of safety and efficiency. This system requires permits 
before any work commences, ensuring all necessary safety 
measures are in place before work begins. Regular safety checks

During a common safety meeting, concerns were raised about 
drivers falling from tankers while loading goods. To address this issue, 
joint discussions were held, leading to the installation and testing of 
fixed engineered lifeline systems. The entire tanker filling post was 
evaluated based on performance, and as a result of these evaluations 
and recommendations, the entire post was equipped with fixed 
engineered lifelines. Currently, the entire complex has been outfitted 
with engineered lifelines at all tanker filling posts, ensuring enhanced 
safety for drivers.

Mechanisms to prevent adverse 
consequences to the complainant 
in discrimination and harassment 
cases.
At Epigral Ltd., we are committed to fostering a workplace free from 
discrimination and harassment. To ensure a safe space for reporting 
concerns, we have implemented several mechanisms to protect 
complainants from retaliation:
	
¾ Confidentiality: We offer multiple reporting channels, including 
anonymous options, to empower employees to voice concerns 
without fear of identification. Strict confidentiality protocols shield 
complainant identities throughout investigations, except when 
necessary for a fair process.
	
¾ Supportive Measures: We provide access to counseling and employee 
assistance programs to help complainants manage the emotional 
impact of the situation. Temporary reassignments or flexible work 
arrangements can be considered to minimize contact with the 
accused and reduce retaliation risk.
	
¾ Anti-Retaliation Policy: Our clear and well-communicated policy 
prohibits any negative actions against those who report or assist in 
investigations. We enforce this policy with clear consequences for 
violations.
	
¾ Prompt Investigations: We conduct swift and impartial investigations 
to minimize disruption and ensure a fair outcome. Trained investigators 
gather objective evidence while protecting everyone’s confidentiality.
	
¾ Building a Safe Culture: We promote a zero-tolerance culture for 
discrimination and harassment. Regular training educates employees 
and managers on respectful behavior, complaint procedures, and 
bystander intervention. We encourage open communication and 
empower employees to speak up if they witness misconduct.
By implementing these safeguards, Epigral fosters a safe space for 
reporting and prevents retaliation. We are committed to ensuring a fair 
and just process for all parties involved.

10	 Briefly describe the waste management practices 
adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy 
adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous 
and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and 
the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
Epigral Ltd. prioritizes responsible waste 
management throughout our manufacturing 
processes. We generate both non-hazardous 
and hazardous waste materials, and we take a 
multi-pronged approach to ensure their safe 
handling and disposal in accordance with 
environmental regulations.
We collect the waste, transport it to a licensed 
Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facility (TSDF) 
site, and ensure transparency by creating online 
manifests on the Gujarat Pollution Control Board 
(GPCB) site. We maintain records of all waste 
disposal activities for complete accountability.
However, waste reduction is a key component 
of our sustainability strategy. We have adopted 
Best Available Technology (BAT) by investing in a 
zero-gap membrane system and a high carbon 
ash recycling system. These technologies 
enhance efficiency and significantly reduce 
waste generation.
Furthermore, we have optimized our processes. 
Epigral transitioned from using barium 
carbonate to remove brine impurities during 
Caustic Soda lye production. This change not 
only reduced the consumption of a natural 
resource but also minimized waste generation 
and eliminated the need for open land disposal 
practices. Additionally, the implementation of 
MSRU technology significantly reduced sludge 
generation from 62 Kg/MT to 23 Kg/MT of 
Caustic Soda. This technology also eliminates the 
use of barium carbonate, further contributing to 
waste reduction.
By implementing these comprehensive 
waste management practices and investing 
in innovative technologies, Epigral Ltd. 
demonstrates its commitment to a sustainable 
future.

Sulphate Removal 
Technologies (MSRU
The sulphate removal 
system is used in the 
Caustic Soda production in 
which barium carbonate is 
used as a raw material to 
remove sulphate from the 
brine circuit. The company 
switched from the use of 
barium carbonate to remove 
brine impurities used in 
the manufacture of Caustic 
Soda lye.
The use of MSRU 
technology helped 
reduce sludge from 
62 Kg/MT to 23Kg/
MT of Caustic Soda; It 
helped eliminate barium 
carbonate and reduce 
waste. The sulphate 
removal system resulted 
in the reduction of waste 
in brine purification / 
clarification for better 
efficiency of RVDF. The 
replacement helped 
reduce the consumption 
of a natural resource, 
reduced waste 
generation and waste 
disposal in open land.

the rooftop of the power 
plant building was collected 
into a dedicated covered pit 
and after analysis is used for 
cooling tower make up).
By utilizing rainwater for 
cooling tower make-up,

its dependence on 
freshwater sources, 
thereby conserving this 
valuable resource
Waste Compost Machine
The company has taken a 
responsible and sustainable 
approach towards waste 
management by utilizing

supplement for the 
green belt and reduces 
waste sent to landfills. 
This approach not 
only supports plant 
growth but also helps 
reduce methane 
generation from 
waste at the dumping 
yard, contributing to 
a more sustainable 
environment.

6.	 Disclose any significant adverse impact to the 
environment, arising from the value chain of 
the entity. What mitigation or adaptation 
measures have been taken by the entity in 
this regard.
Epigral Ltd. recognises the potential environmental risks 
associated with materials within our value chain. These 
substances can be dangerous and even lethal if not handled 
properly. To mitigate these risks, we have implemented a 
multi-pronged approach:
	
¾ Value Chain Assessment: We conducted a comprehensive 
assessment of our value chain, specifically evaluating 
environmental parameters alongside other aspects. 
This allows us to pinpoint areas where environmental 
impact might be most significant and prioritize our risk 
mitigation strategies.
	
¾ Product Stewardship Training: Understanding the 
importance of responsible product handling throughout 
the supply chain, we provide training to our value chain 
partners. This training equips them with the knowledge 
and skills necessary for safe handling practices and 
proper leak management procedures. This focus on 
training aligns perfectly with our commitment to product 
stewardship principles.
By implementing these comprehensive measures, Epigral 
Ltd. demonstrates a strong commitment to minimizing the 
environmental impact of our value chain

packaging.
