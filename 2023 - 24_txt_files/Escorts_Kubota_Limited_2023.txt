Energy & 
Climate 
Change
Risk
As a manufacturer of agricultural 
and construction equipment, EKL is 
dependent on fossil fuels as a source 
of energy for their machinery. Any 
disruption in the supply of fossil fuels 
or a significant increase in their price 
could adversely affect the Company’s 
operations and profitability.
Secondly, as climate change is leading 
to more frequent and intense weather 
events such as floods, droughts, and 
hurricanes, it can impact the demand 
for 
agricultural 
equipment. 
The 
extreme weather events can damage 
crops and reduce the demand for farm 
equipment. This can directly affect the 
sales of EKL, which could lead to a 
decline in revenue.
EKL has taken various steps 
towards mitigation:
1.Working 
and 
launching 
Alternative 
Fuel 
products- 
Electric Tractor, CNG fuel base 
machines, hybrid machines.
2.Leveraging 
Kubota’s 
expertise in advanced farm 
mechanization 
solutions 
to 
address 
global 
food 
security and enhanced farm 
productivity needs.

EHS impact
Risk
EHS risks can have significant impact 
on EKL in several ways which can lead 
to Human cost, legal and regulatory 
consequences,

EKL has established a robust 
Environment, Health and Safety 
(EHS) 
management 
system 
that covers all its operations. 
EKL 
ensures 
compliance 
with all applicable EHS laws 
and regulations, as well as 
international 
standards 
and 
best 
practices. 
EKL 
also 
conducts regular EHS trainings, 
audits, inspections, and risk 
assessments to identify and 
mitigate 
potential 
hazards 
and incidents. EKL also has 
a dedicated EHS team and 
a 
grievance 
mechanism 
to 
address any EHS issues or 
concerns.

Criteria 
The criteria used by the Company to prepare the Subject Matter 1 is summarised below (‘BRSR Framework'):  
• 
Regulation 34(2)(f) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (the “SEBI”) (Listing Obligations and 
Disclosure Requirements), Regulations, 2015, as amended; 
• 
Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting Requirements for listed entities as per Master 
Circular No. SEBI/HO/CFD/PoD2/ CIR/P/2023/120 dated 11 July 2023; and 
• 
SEBI Circular SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD-SEC-2/P/CIR/2023/122 dated 12 July 2023 and clarifications thereto 
issued by SEBI. 
The Company has prepared the Subject Matter 2 included in the Integrated Annual report based on the 
principles of the International Integrated Reporting Framework published by the International Integrated 
Reporting Council (‘IIRC’) of the Value Reporting Foundation with reference to Global Reporting Initiative (‘GRI’) 
Sustainability Reporting Standards (‘the GRI Standards’) issued by Global Sustainability Standards Board 
(GSSB). 
Management’s Responsibilities 
The Company’s management is responsible for selecting or establishing suitable criteria for preparing the 
Identified Sustainability Information, taking into account applicable laws and regulations, if any, related to 
reporting on the Identified Sustainability Information, identification of key aspects, engagement with 
stakeholders, content, preparation and presentation of the Identified Sustainability Information in accordance 
with the Criteria. This responsibility includes design, implementation and maintenance of internal control 
relevant to the preparation of the BRSR Report and the Integrated Annual Report and the measurement of the 
Identified Sustainability Information, which is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
Inherent limitations 
The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure non-
financial information allows for different, but acceptable, measures and measurement techniques and can affect 
comparability between entities.  
Auditor’s Independence and Quality Control 
We are independent of the Company and have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the 
requirements of the International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued by the International Ethics 
Standards Board for Accountants (the ‘IESBA Code’) and have the required competencies and experience to 
conduct this assurance engagement. 
Our firm applies International Standards on Quality Management (‘ISQM’) 1 - Quality Management for Firms 
that Perform Audits or Reviews of Financial Statements, or Other Assurance or Related Services Engagements 
and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and 
procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and 
regulatory requirements. 
 
478
 
 
 
 
 
 
Auditor’s Responsibility  
Our responsibility is to express a reasonable assurance in the form of an opinion on the Subject Matter 1 and 
express a limited assurance in the form of a conclusion on the Subject Matter 2, based on the procedures we 
have performed and evidence we have obtained. We conducted our reasonable assurance engagement and 
limited assurance engagement in accordance with the ISAE 3000 (Revised), “Assurance Engagements other 
than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information” (‘ISAE 3000 (Revised)’) issued by the International 
Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (‘IAASB’). The standard requires that we plan and perform our 
engagement to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Subject Matter 1 is prepared, in all material 
respects, in accordance with the BRSR Framework and limited assurance about whether the Subject Matter 2 
is free from material misstatement. 
A reasonable assurance engagement involves assessing the suitability in the circumstances of the Company’s 
use of the Criteria as the basis for the preparation of the Subject Matter 1, assessing the risks of material 
misstatement of the Subject Matter 1 whether due to fraud or error, responding to the assessed risks as 
necessary in the circumstances and evaluating the overall presentation of the Subject Matter 1.  
A limited assurance engagement involves assessing the suitability in the circumstances of the Company’s use 
of the Criteria as the basis for the preparation of the Subject Matter 2, identifying areas where material 
misstatement is likely to arise in the Subject Matter 2 whether due to fraud or error, designing and performing 
procedures to address identified risk areas as necessary in the circumstances, and evaluating the overall 
presentation of the Subject Matter 2.  
 
A limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement in 
relation to both the risk assessment procedures, including an understanding of internal control, and the 
procedures performed in response to the assessed risks. 
 
Our responsibility is also to provide Type 2 Moderate Assurance in accordance with third version of AA1000 
Assurance Standard (‘AA100AS v3’) issued by AccountAbility which requires us to obtain limited evidence from 
internal sources and parties, evidence gathering is restricted to corporate/management levels in the 
organization to conclude on the nature and extent of adherence of the Report to the AA Accountability Principles 
2018 (“AA1000AP, 2018”), i.e., Inclusivity, Materiality, Responsiveness and Impact including the conclusion on 
reliability and quality, accuracy and completeness of the specified performance information and to assess and 
report findings. Moderate assurance will provide users with a relatively lower level of confidence in an 
organization’s disclosure on the subject matter it refers to. 
 
The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment and included inquiries, observation of 
processes performed, inspection of documents, evaluating the appropriateness of quantification methods and 
reporting policies, analytical procedures and agreeing or reconciling with underlying records. 
 
Given the circumstances of the engagement, in performing the procedures listed above, our work procedures 
included the following: 
• 
Physical site visit at the corporate office at Faridabad and site visit at all the plants in Faridabad for data 
and document verification  
• 
Interviewing senior executives to understand the reporting process, governance, systems and controls 
in place during the reporting period.   
• 
Reviewing the records and relevant documentation including information from audited financial 
statements or statutory reports submitted by the Company to support relevant performance disclosures 
within our scope. 
• 
Evaluating the suitability and application of Criteria and that the Criteria have been applied appropriately 
to the Identified Sustainability Information. . 
• 
Selecting key parameters and representative sampling, based on statistical audit sampling tables and 
agreeing claims to source information to check accuracy and completeness of claims such as source 
data, meter data, etc. 
• 
Re-performing calculations to check accuracy of claims,  
• 
Reviewing data from independent sources, wherever available,  
479
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Reviewing data, information about sustainability performance indicators and statements in the report. 
• 
Reviewing and verifying information/ data as per the BRSR framework and IIRC framework; 
• 
Reviewing accuracy, transparency and completeness of the information/ data provided; 
 
Exclusions 
Our assurance engagement scope excludes the following and therefore we do not express an opinion/ a 
conclusion on the same: 
• 
Any disclosure other than those mentioned in the Identified Sustainability Information section above 
• 
Data and information outside the defined reporting period 
• 
Data related to Company’s financial performance, strategy and other related linkages expressed in the 
Integrated Annual Report.

looking statements provided by the Company and assertions related to Intellectual Property Rights and 
other competitive issues. 
• 
Mapping of the Report with reporting frameworks other than those mentioned in Reporting Criteria above. 
While we considered the effectiveness of management’s internal controls when determining the nature and 
extent of our procedures, our assurance engagement was not designed to provide assurance on internal 
controls. 
The procedures did not include testing controls or performing procedures relating to checking aggregation or 
calculation of data within IT systems. 
 
Opinion 
Based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, the Subject Matter 1 included 
in the BRSR report for the financial year ended 31 March 2024 is prepared in all material respects, in accordance 
with the BRSR Framework.  
Conclusion 
Based on the procedures we have performed and the evidences we have obtained, nothing has come to our 
attention that causes us to believe that Company’s Subject Matter 2 contained in the Integrated Annual report 
for the financial year ended 31 March 2024, is not prepared, in all material respects with reference to GRI 
Standards.  
Our conclusions on the Subject Matter 2’s adherence to the AA1000 Accountability Principles of Inclusivity, 
Materiality, Responsiveness and Impact including the conclusion on Reliability and Quality of the information

impact the company has on these stakeholder groups. We are not aware of any matter that would lead us 
to conclude that the company has not applied the principle of inclusivity in engaging with the key stakeholder 
groups identified in the report. 
• 
Materiality – The Company has reported on material topics across economic, environmental, social, and 
governance aspects, post stakeholder consultations. Nothing has come to our attention that causes us to 
believe that material issues so identified have been excluded from the Report by the Company. 
• 
Responsiveness - The Company has demonstrated their commitment to understand stakeholder concerns, 
as evident from the various stakeholder consultation and engagement mechanisms that have been applied. 
We are not aware of any matter than would lead us to believe that the Company has not applied the

covering its sustainability performance.

processes to measure, monitor and evaluate the economic, environmental and social impacts for select

been applied for the key stakeholders. 
•

disclosed. The data when subject to examination will establish the quality and materiality of the information.
