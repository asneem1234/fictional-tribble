Financial implications of

Plastic waste 
Management rules-2016 
(along with subsequent 
amendments):
MOEF & CC has notified 
“Plastic Waste 
Management Rule 2016 
(amended)” wherein 
fertilizer manufacturing 
companies have to get 
registered with State 
Pollution Control 
Board/Central Pollution 
Control Board as Brand 
Owner and prepare an 
action plan on collecting 
back the plastic waste 
and its disposal. 
Risk
Tightening of Energy 
norms by GoI by 
implementation of NUP-
2015 norms and further 
revision is due in 2025
Risk
• Urea is sold to farmers 
in the country in 
multilayered plastic 
bags. 
• As per latest draft 
notification dated 
06.10.2021 on the 
matter, 100% recycling 
of Plastic Waste 
generated is required to 
recycle in year 2023-24. 
• The annual plastic 
waste generated by NFL 
is approx. 15200 MT.
• Tightening of energy 
norms has reduced 
companies company 
operations shall be 
unviable.
• NFL has achieved the 
target of recycling of 
100% of plastic waste 
for the year 2023-24.
• To meet the revised 
norms of NUP-2015, 
NFL has already spent 
more than Rs 1000 
Crore.
• However, by 
implementation of 
these 
schemes NFL was able 
to only reduce losses 
but further tightening of 
energy norms will make 
operational of these 
plants unviable. 
• Energy Norms of NUP-
2015 (REN) of Vijaipur-I 
Unit till 31-12- 2024 
with penalty of 35% 
difference between REN 
and Target Energy 
Norms (TEN) or till the 
unit achieves the Target 
Energy Norms, 
whichever is earlier.
Negative
• Total financial 
implication for the year 
2023-24 is Rs 1.76 Cr.
• Urea is controlled 
commodity and 
additional expenditure 
will impact the 
financials of the 
company.
Negative
• NFL has completed the 
energy saving projects 
by March 2022 leading 
to reduction of energy 
consumption and 
reduction of carbon 
footprints by more than 
25%. 
• Further energy 
reduction norms by GoI 
will severely impact 
NFL 
profitability.
