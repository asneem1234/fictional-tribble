Financial implications of 
the risk or opportunity 
(Indicate positive or 
negative 
implications) 
1 
Emission 
Risk 
Rising power demand has 
resulted 
in 
higher 
dependence on costlier 
coal imports as supplies 
from domestic sources 
are still insufficient to 
meet increased energy 
demand. 
We are already transitioning to lower 
emissions technology by reducing our 
specific energy consumption and 
increasing our renewable energy 
sources. Close to 56 % of the energy 
we use is from renewable sources 
such as wind, solar and biomass. 
Negative Implication 
2 
Water & effluents 
Risk 
We are dependent on 
surface 
water 
for 
production 
which 
is 
dependent on rain. If we 
receive less rain in a year, it 
will impact our production 
and we have to buy water 
from other sources. 
We are working to reduce our water 
consumption in the processes and 
installed water efficient equipment. 
Both our manufacturing plants are 
Zero Liquid Discharge compliant. Our 
strategy is to treat used industrial 
water on site and reuse water for 
process / utilities. 
Negative Implication 
3 
Health and safety 
Risk 
and 
Opportunity 
Given the nature of our 
business health & safety 
related 
risks 
in 
manufacturing operations 
is one of our top priorities. 
Operational 
risks 
and 
natural hazards are likely 
business disruptions. 
We have health and safety policy and 
at individual plant level and all the 
manufacturing 
sites 
are 
ISO 
45001:2018 compliant. We have 
implemented various initiatives to 
ensure 
health 
and 
safety 
of 
employees across our locations both 
at operational level and managing 
natural hazards. At plants, we ensured 
this by creating task forces to monitor 
and implement health & safety 
measures going beyond compliance 
and adopting industry best practices.

Training 
and 
Development 
Risk 
Given 
the 
context 
of 
rapidly 
expanding 
Chemicals sector, attrition 
of our key talent with niche 
skillsets and that of our 
diverse talent pool is a risk 
which 
can 
impact 
business continuity and 
growth . 
Our strategic people management 
framework is designed to create value 
& execute the business strategy. Built 
on three pillars of talent, organization 
& culture, we strive towards creating 
agile 
& 
inclusive 
workplace 
by 
defining 
& 
developing 
new 
capabilities and accelerating total 
engagement 
to 
build 
a 
high

the thriving culture that exists at GIL 
Chemicals which has helped deliver 
strong business performance.

We are regularly reviewing and 
auditing our people processes and

Risk 
Consumers are now more 
aware 
of 
the 
using 
products 
made 
using 
materials sourced from 
sustainable sources. Any 
negative 
feedback 
or 
concerns 
from 
our 
stakeholders can impact 
our brand value. In the last 
two years, we have seen 
multiple 
queries 
and 
clarification 
from 
our 
major 
customers 
regarding transparency in 
our 
supply 
chain 
and 
grievance mechanism. 
Sustainable Supply Chain: We have 
made our sustainable palm oil policy 
and have taken goal of achieving 
100% transparency upto mills and 
refineries in our palm supply chain. To 
achieve that we collaborate with our 
suppliers and have also became a 
part 
of 
Action 
for 
sustainable

ASD 
is 
a 
collaborative initiative which brings 
together companies in the cosmetics, 
home and personal care, and oleo 
chemicals industries to collectively 
tackle supply chain issues around

10. Health and safety management system:  
a. Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Yes/ 
No). If yes, the coverage such system?  
Occupational health and safety (OHS) is integral to our business philosophy at our Company, particularly in the 
chemicals sector where the importance of safety cannot be overstated. We are proud to announce that both our 
Valia and Ambernath sites have been certified with ISO 45001 for Occupational Health & Safety Management System 
and Responsible Care logo. Aligned with our mission, "Aim for Zero," we continuously strive towards the elimination 
of incidents and injuries in the workplace. This mission underscores our unwavering commitment to providing a safe 
and healthy environment for all our employees. Every employee who accesses our operating sites at Valia and 
Ambernath is covered under our comprehensive OHS management systems. Regular audits are conducted to 
ensure strict compliance with safety protocols and to facilitate ongoing improvements in our safety practices. Our 
 
25 
 
proactive approach to safety not only safeguards our workforce but also contributes to the sustainability and 
resilience of our operations. 
 
b. What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine 
basis by the entity? 
We have employed a multi-faceted approach to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on both routine and 
non-routine bases. Our central safety committee and plant-level safety committees are entrusted with the 
responsibility of monitoring and managing safety aspects across our operations. 
Safety statistics are meticulously recorded and reported on our dedicated e-platform, enabling real-time tracking 
and analysis. In the event of safety-related incidents, root cause assessments are conducted to understand the 
underlying reasons and prevent their recurrence. 
To systematically address potential risks, we maintain a Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA) register 
for all plant-related activities. This register allows us to track expected hazards and analyze risks, facilitating the 
implementation of appropriate control measures. In addition to HIRA assessments, we utilize various safety 
protocols, including Job Safety Analysis (JSA), Hazard and Operability Study (Hazop), Quantitative Risk Assessment 
(QRA), and Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR). These measures are integral to our comprehensive approach to 
ensuring workplace safety. Furthermore, we have conducted a detailed safety assessment that demonstrates none 
of our workers have a high incidence of occupational risk or disease. This underscores our commitment to providing 
a safe and healthy work environment for all employees. 
c. Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from 
such risks. (Y/N)  
 
Yes, we have established processes to empower workers to report work-related hazards and remove themselves 
from such risks. Our commitment to occupational health and safety includes fostering a culture where employees 
feel comfortable reporting hazards and taking necessary actions to mitigate risks. Employees are encouraged to 
report any work-related hazards they encounter through various channels, including direct communication with 
their supervisors, safety committees, or designated reporting systems. Additionally, anonymous reporting 
mechanisms like suggestion/complaint boxes are in place to ensure that employees can raise concerns without 
fear of reprisal. Upon receiving a hazard report, our safety committees promptly investigate the issue to assess its 
severity and determine appropriate corrective actions. Workers are actively involved in this process, providing 
valuable insights and feedback to address safety concerns effectively. Furthermore, our policies support workers' 
rights to remove themselves from situations where they perceive imminent danger or unsafe conditions. Employees 
are empowered to halt work activities if they believe there is a risk to their health or safety until appropriate measures 
are taken to mitigate the hazard. 
d. Do the employees/ worker of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services? 
(Yes/ No)  
 
Yes, we have OHC in our plant premises with all facilities. We are in the process of developing a policy for providing 
the employees with reimbursements against non-occupational and healthcare services.

12. Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy work place. 
In our commitment to ensuring a safe and healthy work environment, we have implemented robust safety practices 
and initiatives across our manufacturing sites. Monthly safety performance reviews are conducted by top management 
during the Safety and Conversion meet, where both internal and external boards provide valuable insights for 
improvement on a quarterly basis. Our Joint Safety Committee, chaired by the Site Head and Safety In-charge, 
comprises members from various categories, including staff, operators, and contractors. Regular training sessions are 
conducted for both company and contractor employees on a range of topics such as behavioural safety, fire safety, 
SCBA, MSDS, EMS-OHS standards, and Responsible Care. To bolster safety awareness, we conduct emergency drills 
and training exercises regularly. Periodic risk assessment studies, including HAZOP, HAC, JSA, JRA,PSSR, and 
workplace monitoring studies, are integral to our safety protocols. Additionally, we conduct weekly and monthly 
inspections, Artificial intelligence and HIRA assessments, cross-functional safety audits, and external safety audits. 
Our management conducts safety tour rounds monthly, and safety moments are shared before formal meetings. The 
ritual of taking a safety pledge before commencing work in the morning reinforces our commitment to safety. We hold 
monthly safety meetings with all departments and conduct "Safety ki Pathshala" for contractors. Furthermore, our CEO 
actively participates in monthly safety meetings to review safety practices. Ensuring the well-being of our employees is 
paramount, and our Occupational Health Centre (OHC) operates round the clock to provide necessary medical 
assistance. Regular medical check-ups are conducted for all employees, including contract workers, and detailed 
health records are maintained diligently.

Leadership Indicators 
1. Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, 
and social topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the 
Board. 
 
Our stakeholders are at the heart of our process of determining material topics so as to collectively address ESG 
aspects and develop lasting solutions. Periodic engagement with stakeholders helps us to effectively channel our 
strategies to be able to deliver against company wide sustainability goals while following an inclusive, multi-
dimensional approach. We use the stakeholder prioritization matrix to understand key stakeholders to our business 
and the type of engagement to be carried out with each of them - consult, collaborate, keep informed & engage. Our 
regular interactions through various engagement modules aid us in collecting important feedback, thereby 
enhancing our performance and value addition. While the kind of our engagement methods can differ from an ad-
hoc meeting to long term partnership, it is always driven by our core values. Our key stakeholder groups comprise 
of employees, customers, regulatory bodies, shareholders, team members, suppliers, sustainability experts, 
media, competitors, academia and the communities around operational sites. We use formal and informal 
engagement methods to communicate with our stakeholders through various communication platforms. Through 
this, we map stakeholder feedback and concerns. Appropriate action plans are also developed to address 
expectations. These concerns and expectations form a vital input for our materiality assessment and in developing 
short and long term business goals. The Stakeholder engagement exercise was conducted using the principles and

yield minimal waste. We follow five R’s of waste management - reduce, reuse, recycle, recover and residual 
management. We go beyond compliance to ensure effective waste management. Our waste management 
strategy includes collection, segregation, recycling and disposal in a scientific manner. We have an in-house 
effluent treatment plant (ETP) to treat wastewater generated at our facilities. Our ETP plant manages effluents 
generated from our facilities. Our effluent management has helped us reduce our impact on local water 
resources. Both our manufacturing sites - Valia and Ambernath - are zero liquid discharge facilities (ZLD).

8. Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide 
details. 
 
We are committed to the Group’s Good & Green vision of building an inclusive and greener world. At the core 
of our sustainability strategy, we focus on maximizing our resource efficiency and reducing our environmental 
impact. All our green targets are focused around these two aspects. To reduce scope 1 emissions in our 
operational areas, we have increased the number of briquette boilers for steam generation and also for 
thermic fluid heating in plant. We have decentralized Cooling tower in Ambernath unit which reduced our 
power consumption for cooling water circulation across the plant. For controlling our scope 2 emissions, we 
have installed solar rooftop for electricity generation and have also started wheeling our wind energy power 
for Ambernath unit. For Valia, we have commissioned biomass-based cogeneration plant that generates green 
electricity and also fulfill the steam requirement. It will reduce our scope 2 emissions and also drastically 
improve our renewable portfolio. We are committed to decarbonizing our operations in line with the WB2DS 
set by the global SBTi committee.
