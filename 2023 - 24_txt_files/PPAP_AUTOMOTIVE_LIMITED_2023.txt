FROM THE CHAIRMAN’S DESK
24
My Dear Stakeholders,
I am delighted to present the Annual Report for the Financial Year 2023-24 on behalf of our esteemed Board of Directors.
The global landscape continues to pose challenges, marked by ongoing geopolitical tensions and supply chain disruptions due to 
military conﬂ icts. Amidst this global turmoil, India stands resilient as an oasis of opportunity. The Government's strategic initiatives 
aimed at bolstering the domestic economy, enhancing capital spending, improving business environment, and advancing digital 
infrastructure have fostered robust GDP growth rates exceeding 7% annually for the past three years, peaking at over 8% in the year 
under review.
In the automotive sector, we have witnessed signiﬁ cant growth globally, driven by pent-up demand post-pandemic and improved 
supply chain dynamics. India has emerged as a formidable player, securing the third position globally in vehicle registrations across 
various categories. However, challenges remain, particularly in achieving comparable vehicle selling prices to more developed 
markets.
Throughout the ﬁ scal year, we have undertaken substantial reforms and strategic actions within the company to strengthen our 
operational foundations. Key initiatives include restructuring our HR policies, optimizing internal processes to maximize capacity 
utilization, fostering collaboration across sales and engineering teams, and enhancing efﬁ ciency in manufacturing and supply chain 
operations.
Throughout the ﬁ scal year, our business verticals have capitalized on opportunities, particularly in expanding our product offerings 
within the Automotive Parts segment. These strategic efforts, coupled with focused negotiations for advantageous terms with our 
customers and streamlining of internal processes, have signiﬁ cantly bolstered our overall performance.
I am pleased to announce that our Joint Venture has made substantial strides in reducing losses, positioning itself on a trajectory 
towards proﬁ tability. Based on current trends, we anticipate the JV company to achieve proﬁ tability this year, thereby making a 
positive contribution to our group's ﬁ nancial health.
Furthermore, we have successfully secured contracts with clients gearing up to launch electric vehicles in the future. The stabilization 
of raw material prices and our internal cost-reduction initiatives have notably enhanced our margins since last year. Our proactive 
negotiations with customers to mitigate inﬂ ationary pressures have yielded favourable outcomes, further strengthening our ﬁ nancial 
resilience.
In addition, our Commercial Toolroom Division has been rebranded as Meraki Precision Molds, garnering signiﬁ cant traction in the 
market.
Our Aftermarket Division has expanded its footprint to include 123 distributors across India and is actively venturing into international 
markets. This year alone, we have introduced over 550 new products, expanding our total to more than 1,080 SKUs. I am conﬁ dent 
that these strategic initiatives, coupled with our sustained efforts over the past years, will yield improved outcomes in the current ﬁ scal 
year, reinforcing the fundamentals of our company and creating enhanced value for all stakeholders.
On the sustainability front, we are proud to achieve EcoVadis Certiﬁ cation and comply with BRSR requirements, underscoring our 
dedication to responsible business practices. Our ongoing CSR efforts through the Vinay and Ajay Jain Foundation reafﬁ rm our 
commitment to community development and environmental stewardship.
