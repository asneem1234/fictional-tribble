1. 
Customer 
Experience 
Risk 
Given 
that 
MGFL 
provides 
financial 
products and services to 
thousands of customers, 
any 
undesirable 
customer 
experience 
could result in loss of 
customers 
or 
even 
reputational loss. 
Listening to customers and driving 
continuous 
transformation 
to 
provide 
them 
a 
frictionless 
experience is what MGFL has always 
strived for. Ethics, transparency, and 
accountability are deeply ingrained 
and practiced in daily operations, 
including in dealing with customers. 
Negative  
Loss of reputation 
can result in loss of 
customer 
thereby 
adversely impacting 
businesses of MGFL. 
2. 
Financial 
Inclusion 
Opportunity The reach of financial 
products and services is 
still shallow in India, 
especially in the mass 
segment 
and 
semi-
urban / rural parts of 
India. 
MGFL’s customer reach is achieved 
through 
dealer 
networks, 
adaptation of innovative technology 
solutions to provide a seamless 
customer journey through its digital 
platforms and customized product 
offering. MGFL has a customer base 
of more than 21000 unbanked 
customers in FY2023 and 40,000 in 
FY2024. 
Positive  
MGFL has created 
deep distribution in 
Tier-2 and 3 cities 
across the country 
thereby 
taking 
financial 
solutions 
closer to the society.

Servicing: After granting of loan, there can be various reasons for which a customer may need servicing. 
Collecting instalments is one of the critical part of customer servicing. However, there can be many more 
instances when a customer can reach out such as requesting change in personal information, adding / changing 
nominees, grievance redressal etc. We believe in enhancing customer experience and have a number of digital 
tools where the customer can self-service or in the alternate, can also reach out at our offices, write to / call us 
etc.
