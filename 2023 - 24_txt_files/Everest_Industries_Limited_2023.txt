1
GHG Emissions 
(Climate Change)
Risk and 
Opportunity
(Risk): Climate Impacts 
are affecting society and 
businesses. GHG reduction 
is also expected by Govt, 
Investors and customers.
(Opportunity): The 
demand for Green 
Buildings is increasing 
with a preference for 
more resource-efficient 
materials and lower GHG 
emissions.
Our response to adapt to climate change and 
focus on GHG Emissions Management will 
enable a more resilient business. We have 
undertaken a number of initiatives on energy 
efficiency, improving our renewable energy 
mix, usage of cleaner fuel, upgrading to 
energy efficient equipment as well as looking 
at supply chain improvements to reduce 
our GHG emissions. This would mitigate 
any impact from regulators, investors, or 
government regulations. This will improve our 
brand and customer attraction and resource 
efficiency will also improve our margins. 
The preference for energy-efficient green 
buildings is a significant driver for our ESBS, 
Boards and Panels businesses.
Positive
2
Energy 
Consumption
Opportunity
Our plants and equipment 
consume energy including 
electricity from the grid 
which is a significant 
contributor to our costs. 
We actively focus on 
opportunities to reduce 
energy consumption
The company keeps an active track of energy 
consumption and runs certain Six Sigma 
projects to reduce and manage energy 
consumption. The Company has invested in 
rooftop solar projects for captive consumption 
within the plants. We are also improving 
operational timing controls to reduce energy 
loss and are enhancing the monitoring of 
energy usage data.
Positive
3
Water and Waste 
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Water is a key 
component of our 
manufacturing process 
and water stress will lead 
to increasing costs and 
lower availability. Water 
management is a necessity 
for responsible businesses.
(Opportunity): We recognize 
that adopting the 3 R 
principles leads to direct 
economic impact.
Our plants are zero-discharge plants where 
process wastewater is re-used. We are 
monitoring water consumption and are 
exploring digital water meters and real-
time monitoring. Domestic sewage is being 
treated through a sewage treatment plant, 
and treated water is utilized for gardening. 
Ozonation technology is being introduced at 
our new plants for STP.
Waste management details are also given in 
Principle 6, Indicator 10.

Environmental 
Impact of 
Products (R&D)
Risk and 
Opportunity
Changes in existing 
regulations/ emerging 
regulations impacting the 
sourcing of materials, 
emissions, waste 
generation, storage and 
during the use or disposal 
of finished goods
Institutional customers 
prefer products with lower 
environmental impacts.
The Boards and ESBS products are 
environmentally friendly and therefore 
are an opportunity. Additionally, our R&D 
efforts are focused on increasing the use of 
environmentally sustainable raw materials.
Negative
5
Innovation & 
New Product 
Development 
(R&D)
Risk and 
Opportunity
Asbestos Fiber may come 
under regulation in the 
future.
There is increasing 
consumer awareness and 
demand for sustainable 
products, and this allows 
us to strengthen our 
product differentiation
Everest is investing in R&D to develop 
products to address opportunities in emerging 
areas. We are a pioneer and leader in non-
asbestos cement roofing sheets.
R&D spending is focused on new and 
differentiated products. We have identified 
several products in the development pipeline 
that will help differentiate from FCB as well 
as competing categories. We have obtained 
GRIHA certifications for some of our products. 
Some of our products enable our customers 
to get LEED certification.
Positive
6
Human Capital 
- Employee 
Engagement, 
Retention
Risk and 
Opportunity
(Risk) Employee attrition 
can have a detrimental 
impact on stakeholder 
relationships, continuity 
and has an additional 
cost for recruitment and 
training
(Opportunity) Increase 
productivity and hence 
profitability.
We focus on ensuring higher employee 
engagement through various initiatives, 
including succession planning, training, and 
benchmarking for compensation and benefits.
Rewards and recognition aligned with our 
values to acknowledge individuals who go 
beyond their day-to-day duties are a focus. 
Career progression is enabled through fair, 
merit-based performance assessments, 
annual merit increments, and internal job 
postings. Emphasis on development through 
various learning interventions, including 
product/process training, on-the-job training, 
professional development programs and 
managerial development interventions.

Labour Relations Risk
Disruption in 
manufacturing due 
to labour unrest or 
compliance issues
We have strong processes to ensure 
regulatory and legal compliance for 
both direct and indirect manpower. The 
management engages with the entire 
workforce to ensure that their issues are 
heard and understood. Knowledge-sharing 
sessions on labor laws, situation-based 
learning, employee life cycle documentation, 
regular IR management and contract labor 
management are being undertaken.
Negative
8
Diversity 
and Equal 
Opportunity
Opportunity
Embracing diversity and 
fostering inclusive work 
positively impacts business 
performance through 
better decisions and 
problem-solving. This is 
likely to positively impact 
employee attraction growth 
and retention
Everest is committed to eliminating all forms 
of discrimination of any sort (gender, race, 
etc.) and actively promotes diversity within the 
company.
The Company has also developed a policy on 
Equal Opportunities for differently abled and 
identified roles for such employees to perform 
their duties despite disability.
Positive
9
Health & Safety
Risk
The manufacturing 
operations of the Company 
require employees to 
interact with the plant, 
machinery, and material-
handling equipment. These 
carry an inherent risk of 
injury which is detrimental 
to the well-being of 
employees as well as 
impact the operations of 
the company.
The Company places a strong emphasis on 
healthy and safe workplaces. We provide 
adequate health and safety resources, 
including manpower, training, and 
infrastructure to ensure a safe workplace. We 
are also enhancing health and safety skills 
through training and course development, 
tracked in Learning Management Systems.
Details are in Principle 3 Indicators 10 and 12
Negative
10
Supply Chain 
and Sustainable 
Sourcing
Risk and 
Opportunity
(Risk) Disruption in 
the supply chain due 
to unavailability of 
key RM, increased/
volatile commodity and 
transportation costs 
(Opportunity) sustainable 
supply chain processes 
would also help reduce our 
environmental impact and 
improve our social impact.
The company actively evaluates spend 
categories and sourcing locations from a 
risk perspective. For critical imports like 
pulp and Asbestos fiber, it has diversified its 
supplier base while collaborating for ensuring 
steady supplies. Initiatives for raw material 
substitution and product enhancement have 
been successfully implemented. We have 
our Sustainable sourcing policy in place and 
suppliers adhering to our policy are preferred.

Risk 
Management
Risk
Risk management is 
an integral part of our 
approach to addressing 
business risks. Non-
compliance with 
environmental, social, 
regulatory, and statutory 
requirements can impact 
stakeholder relationships 
and disrupt operations.
Everest has implemented a robust risk 
management process to actively identify risks 
and implement mitigation measures. We have 
expanded the risk register to include a variety 
of ESG risks.
We have also finalized our business continuity 
and disaster recovery plan as part of our risk 
mitigation measures. Everest leverages a 
technology tool to ensure compliance with 
various laws. Legal updates are also tracked 
through this tool, seminars, websites, etc..

7.	 Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets and 
achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
	
Everest’s vision is to reimagine spaces to improve people’s lives based on our core values of respect, excellence, and integrity. These values 
are fundamental to our company’s ethos and approach at strategic and operational levels.
	
We believe in the crucial role of ESG for the very survival of this planet and its prosperity. Our commitment to environmental, social, and 
governance (ESG) extends beyond mere adherence to regulations; it is about creating a substantial positive influence on our community 
and the environment.
	
Strengthening ESG Focus
	
We have initiated the measurement of GHG emissions as a first step towards our ambition to substantially reduce the environmental 
impact of our operations. Our initiatives include reducing carbon emissions, expanding the use of renewable energy, and improving 
waste management protocols. By embracing the principles of a circular economy, we aim to minimize waste and maximize recycling 
while ensuring our operations are as sustainable as possible.
	
As part of our social responsibility, we are committed to diversity and inclusion. Our board includes 25% female directors, and we have 
increased the number of women in our workforce to 6.9% in the current year. We endeavor to employ individuals with disabilities and 
provide them with maximum support while assigning their roles. Our goal is to become an inclusive workplace where individuals are 
acknowledged and respected for their contributions.
	
Strong Governance
	
Solid governance is the bedrock of trust and integrity. We are devoted to maintaining the highest standards of corporate governance 
and transparency. We have aligned ourselves with regulatory demands and industry practices through consistent reviews and 
updates of our policies and procedures. This has enabled us to preserve the trust of our stakeholders.

safe and healthy workplace. 
	
The company’s commitment to safety through various initiatives 
and practices demonstrates a proactive approach to ensuring 
the well-being of its workforce and maintaining a healthy 
work environment. Ensuring a safe and healthy workplace is 
of utmost importance for Everest. A series of measures have 
been taken. These measures include, but are not limited to:
 
 
Safe system of work, such as the Permit to Work 
system across plant and project sites.
 
 
Implementation of pre-start work safety briefings 
and 
EHS 
(Environment, 
Health, 
and 
Safety) 
induction training.
 
 
A 
strategic 
focus 
on 
proactively 
identifying 
hazards and risks.
 
 
Fail-safe Drive: Key initiatives that primarily focus on 
eliminating hazards and risks, as well as exploring 
opportunities for substitution or engineering control.
 
 
Effective communication: top-down communication, 
such as safety sessions addressed by the chairman during 
town hall meetings, and bottom-up communication, 
including safety suggestions and interactions between 
leaders and workers during walk-throughs.
 
 
Campaign walk-throughs: monthly walk-throughs 
conducted at the plant level to improve awareness.

of health & safety practices and working conditions. 
	
The company is committed to maintaining a safe and 
healthy work environment. We continuously monitor and 
assess our health and safety practices. When an incident 
is reported, we investigate to identify the root cause and 
implement corrective measures. These measures are then 
reviewed by top management.
	
Recognizing safety as an area for continuous improvement, 
we are comprehensively revamping our Environment, 
Health, and Safety (EHS) Management System. We have 
identified road safety, site safety, and plant safety as key 
areas requiring corrective action.
	
For road safety, our employees often drive to dealer 
premises. To ensure their safety, we have conducted 
defensive driving training, revamped its content, and 
observed a road safety awareness month.
	
For site safety at ESBS, we are enhancing thought-
based safety beyond Behavior-Based Safety (BBS). We 
are also implementing spot corrections for any identified 
deviations and developing dedicated safety courses for the 
construction team.
	
For plant safety, we are focusing on enhancing fail-safe 
systems. This primarily includes machine guarding and the 
implementation of Lock-out, Tag-out, and Test & Try Out 
(LOTOTO) systems.

PRINCIPLE 9 Businesses should engage with and provide value to their consumers in a responsible manner
Essential Indicators
1.	
Describe the mechanisms in place to receive and respond to consumer complaints and feedback. 
	
Our customer engagement and complaint resolution processes are uniquely designed for each business unit. 
	
In the case of our Fibre Cement Business, we have a structured approach to address customer grievances, with documented 
procedures for each complaint type. The primary resolution path involves our sales force and regional leaders, governed by a 
structured process. For non-transactional issues, customers can directly contact the Business Unit Head via email or phone, 
with all communications recorded. A helpline and email address are provided on our website for issue documentation and 
tracking. A dedicated WhatsApp helpline allows for immediate complaint registration and tracking, with resolutions delivered 
swiftly according to set timelines. Customer service teams conduct on-site inspections to determine the validity of product-
related complaints, leading to compensation, education, or claim rejection based on merit. Regular meetings with contractors 
and industry influencers serve as additional feedback channels.
	
For Pre-Engineered Steel Buildings with B2B customers, a distinct process addresses grievances, with sales representatives 
and site engineers serving as the first point of contact. Issues are collaboratively examined with stakeholders, followed by a 
formal action plan communicated by the sales team. A dedicated committee handles escalated issues, while Non-Conformance 
Reports are systematically tracked. Contractors engage via calls or emails, with resolutions often reached through face-to-face 
discussions. Upon project completion, a comprehensive feedback form evaluates all stages, from design to handover.
	
This streamlined structure ensures that all customer feedback is addressed efficiently and effectively, maintaining high standards 
of service and support.
2.	
Turnover of products and/ services as a percentage of turnover from all products/services that carry information about: 
	
Our roofing products do not have any form of packaging. This contributes 54% of the revenue. 
	
Boards and Panels have varied configurations. This contributes 19% of the revenue. As such the individual products do not carry 
information on environmental, social, safety or recycling/disposal information. However, we ensure that all the product-specific 
information as mandated by the law (ISI mark, date of production, company branding, and batch number, etc) is displayed on the 
product. Beyond that, any additional information i.e., technical specifications, Green labels and installation manuals are provided 
in the form of a leaflet for specific products. For safe and responsible usage of the goods, we provide technical manuals and 
videos for installation. For environmental and safety aspects related to the usage of our products, we address these through 
our value chain. Training sessions are conducted for all the installers (roofers and contractors). The technical and sales team 
provides training about safe practices, improving efficiency and prolonging the life of the product.
