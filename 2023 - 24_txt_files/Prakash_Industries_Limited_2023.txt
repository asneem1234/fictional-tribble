or opportunity 
(R/O)

Financial implications of 
the risk or opportunity 
(Indicate positive or 
negative implications)
1
Environment 
Energy and 
Emission 
Management 
Risk
As Steel manufacturing 
and Power Generation is fuel 
and energy centric process 
and we use Fuel (Coal)
and Energy for all operations,
hence, we need to make
investments for Energy
Efficiency and Emission
Management to meet the
Statutory Compliances.
We strived to make timely and 
suitable investments for continued 
compliances and even beyond. 
Our manufacturing processes are 
energy efficient & ensures Natural 
resources. We have taken up 
various emission reduction and 
energy conservation initiatives 
at our manufacturing facilities 
over years. We also focus on 
Utilization of the by product – 
Char and other usable wastes 
to conserve natural resources 
including Coal.
Positive:
The investments in energy
and emission management
systems and technologies
have a financial impact on
our business, which we
consciously acknowledge
and accept.  However it 
ensures the clean working 
environment for the 
employees and other stack 
holders which is beneficial 
to the Company. 
2
Occupational 
Health and 
Safety
Risk
Employees and workers are
key resources of our business
operations, and we believe
in providing them a safe and
healthy work environment.
Additionally, Employee Health
and Safety related incidents 
may create the regulatory 
compliance, reputational, and 
business continuity risks. And 
therefore Risk of failure/ non-
compliance can impact the 
business operations
We strive to make suitable 
investments in safety related 
technology and Personal 
Protective Equipment (PPE) for 
employees. Our safety training 
programme is also an important 
aspect to mitigate the associated 
risk. We organize the Safety 
Awareness programmes and 
promotional events (Safety 
Week) for creating awareness on 
occupational health & safety at 
all level.
Positive:
Company invest in safety 
related technology, PPE and 
training, However it leads 
to benefits of uninterrupted 
operations and downtime 
and reduce the losses 
and thus create safety 
work culture and boost the 
morale of employees.
3
Risk, 
Opportunities 
and Crisis 
Management
Risk
We perceive crises
management as a risk
because it has the potential
of unprecedented problems
which could lead to business
disruptions and downtime.
We have established robust
SOPs as per ISO systems,
conducted toolbox meetings
at shop floor, analysed
near miss cases and have
developed plans to manage
various risk and take
appropriate actions.
Positive:
Establishing robust HSE, 
and training of workforce/ 
employees require 
investments, but it results 
in a positive impact due 
to prevention of avoidable 
operational interruptions.
4
Employee 
Well Being
Risk
Employee Morale and 
Engagement as well as 
healthy work environment is 
the most important factor for 
employee wellbeing.
We focus to mitigate this risk by 
having a continuous interaction 
and emphasis on upgrading 
systems and processes to 
cater to the changing needs of 
employees and their families. 
We arrange various training and 
recreational programmes within 
the organisation which enhances 
employee Belongingness.
Positive:
Although the systems 
and processes require 
investments and costs 
in implementing and 
maintaining these programs, 
however, the direct result 
can be linked with increased 
employee loyalty and longer 
average service tenure 
and better manpower 
Productivity

Water and 
Waste 
Management
Risk
Risk is always associated 
with Water & Waste Water 
Management as poor waste 
water management and 
higher uncontrolled water 
consumption mainly lead to 
situation of water availability 
problem which may affect the 
business adversely.
We ensure optimum use of 
water by effective monitoring 
system to conserve water as 
well as recycling of the waste 
water through ETP and STP. We 
take significant care to ensure 
minimal generation of solid or 
hazardous waste from various 
operations and have developed 
a system to utilize the waste in 
the processes by recycling (Char, 
Slag, Accretion) etc. and also 
disposal in a scientific manner as 
per regulatory guidelines. Water 
is the most crucial resource for 
our plant  and we ensure the Zero 
Liquid Discharge (ZLD) status for 
the Plant.
Negative:
The Company has to invest
for the water treatment and
Waste Disposal to Ensure
the compliance of regulatory
guidelines.

In the process of sponge iron production, coal is used for generating heat and chemical reaction for removing 
the oxygen from iron ore, During this metallurgical process reaction, along with sponge iron, coal char and 
flue gas is generated as by product of DRI Process. In order to utilise Waste, this coal char is being used as 
a fuel for the generation of power in captive power plant. By utilizing the char in power Generation Company 
PRAKASH INDUSTRIES LIMITED
Annual Report 2023-24 | 55
is saving proportionate quantity of coal and contributing for conservation of natural resources and keeping 
the nature and atmosphere clean. To utilize the flue gas of the DRI Process the company has installed the 
Waste Heat Recovery System for Generation of Power by utilizing the Flue gas.
	
The Slag generated during the process of steel making in Induction Furnace contains Iron particles mixed 
with slag. To recover the metal particles, magnetic slag crusher has been established. The recovery of metal 
particles is approximately 10% which is reused in the process of induction furnace for steel making. By this, 
proportionate amount of raw material i.e., mineral is saved. By doing such practices, we are using a waste 
as a source of energy & controlling environmental pollution and conserving the natural resources. As far as 
remaining part of slag is concerned, we are using it for levelling work and road making etc.
	
The Waste generation of Power Plant is Fly ash is being used in brick /block making, road making, and various 
concrete applications and is disposed off in abandoned mines. We are having fly ash brick manufacturing 
plant inside our premises. Fly ash bricks are used in all type of construction carried out in the plant. Apart

We have provided Bag filter system for control of source emission and Fogging system for fugitive emission 
which are working more efficiently. We have deployed a road cleaning machine for better housekeeping of the 
plant. We have CC roads in the plant to minimize dust emission during vehicular movements. Time to time, 
we have made retrofitting work of ESPs, Bag filters, Venture scrubber systems & Fume scrubber systems 
to improve efficiency of air pollution control devices and to minimize the pollution load in the environment. 
We have regular programmes for plantation and this year we have planned to plant 10000 saplings in the 
plant premises. We are implementing effluent treatment plant and reuse of treated wastewater for cooling 
tower make up water, dust separation systems, pug mills area, ash handling systems, water spraying in raw 
material storage yard & finished product area, cleaning of road area, horticulture & plantation purpose. This 
has been saving the consumption of fresh water. We have installed sewage treatment plant for treatment of 
domestic water and are using treated water for plantation purpose.
 
The Company is installed the following systems for utilization of waste and reducing the adverse impact on 
the environment.
	
(i)	
WASTE HEAT RECOVERY BOILER (WHRB):
	
	
WHRB is a well known technology for the generation of power from the waste heat, generated from 
source. Here, we use waste heat from rotary kiln where coal is used for the generation of heat for the 
purpose of melting of raw materials used for sponge production. Instead of leaving the huge quantity 
PRAKASH INDUSTRIES LIMITED
60  |  Annual Report 2023-24
of heat in atmosphere which could unbalance its stability; we use it for 75 MW power generation. The 
generated power from the process is used for Industrial use. By this process, we are preventing to 
release the hot gases in atmosphere and on the other hand we are re-cycling & re-using our waste 
resources.
 
(ii) 
UTILIZATION OF COAL CHAR:
	
	
In the process of sponge iron production, coal is used as a raw material for generating heat. At the 
end of the process, coal char is also generated. This coal char is solid waste after the process which 
we are using as fuel for the generation of power in captive power plant. By Utilizing the char in power 
generation, we are reducing the coal consumption respectively and also utilizing the Waste for creating 
Best out of it which leads to make our surroundings better and leads to create a clean and green 
environment. 
 
(iii) SLAG CRUSHER:
	
	
Slag is generated during the process of steel making in Induction Furnace which contains DRI Sponge 
(pellet/Ore) and Steel particles embedded and mixed with IFD slag. To recover the Sponge iron particles, 
A magnetic Slag Crusher is Installed to processing and recovery Sponge iron particle from Slag. The 
recovery of sponge particles is approximately 10% which is reused in the process of Induction furnace 
for steel making. By this, substantial amount of raw material (i.e., mineral) is saved. By doing this, we 
are using waste as a source of mineral & controlling environmental pollution.
