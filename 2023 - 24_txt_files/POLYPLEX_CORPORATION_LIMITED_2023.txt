*Actual spent on the investments approved during the year
2.	
Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No) b. If yes, what percentage of inputs 
were sourced sustainably?
	
Yes, the Company encourages sustainable sourcing through localization of raw material procurement, reuse of pallets 
& packaging materials, focus on bio sourced raw materials and continuous evaluation of alternative transportation 
arrangements. The intent is to source the Raw Material locally wherever it is available; imports are only in case of local 
unavailability – on an average about 92.94% is domestically sourced. The Company strives to work with the same raw 
material/service providers thereby setting an exemplary model, in terms of stakeholder engagement.
	
Our commitment to fostering trust-based relationships with our supply chain partners is paramount. By adhering to 
our code of conduct and engaging in regular dialogue to address any concerns, our partners contribute significantly to 
our mission. Together, we work towards a culture characterized by honesty, integrity, and accountability, ensuring that 
our business practices not only meet but exceed the ethical standards expected by our stakeholders.
3.	
Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end 
of life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.
	
Polyplex recognises the importance of environmental stewardship and strives to reduce waste through the usage of the 
3 R’s (Reuse, Reduce and Recycle). We minimize manufacturing waste through source reduction, reuse and recycling, 
and responsibly disposing of hazardous waste. Waste from direct materials, packaging materials and plant operations 
are the three categories of waste generated by our operations (hazardous and non-hazardous). Because PET in both film 
and resins is often recyclable, the polyester film manufacturing process has a minimal environmental impact. We have 
the required EIA approval for its Polyester resin line, and we provide periodical reports to the competent authorities 
as required by the Environmental Clearance (EC).
Categories of waste generation
Sub-categories
Steps to minimize waste
Waste from direct materials
Non-hazardous waste like polyester 
chip lumps, polyester film lumps, waste 
trimmings, contaminated films, and waste 
aluminium coated film.
We recycle and reuse 99% of our simple 
PET film waste and the remaining is sold to 
third-party contractors.
Waste from packaging materials Waste like wooden pallets, plastics, PVC 
cups, and paper cores as packaging material 
for both incoming material, as well as 
finished goods.
We re-use packaging material internally 
multiple times and the remaining is sold to 
third parties.
Waste from plant operations
Waste like sludge from ETP and tank 
bottom, oil and lubricants, scrap metal, 
batteries, chemical waste, and used drums.
Most of the waste is non-hazardous and 
sold to third parties. Hazardous waste is 
disposed to authorized vendors.
4.	
Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities.
	
(Yes / No). If yes, whether the waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) 
plan submitted to Pollution Control Boards? If not, provide steps taken to address the same.
	
EPR is applicable to our activities. The registration as a Producer, as an Importer and Recycler has already been 
received. As a responsible manufacturer of Polymeric films, the Company abides by the obligations under the EPR plan.
