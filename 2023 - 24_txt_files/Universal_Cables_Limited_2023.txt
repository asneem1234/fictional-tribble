Positive
UCL’s strategic investments in solar power
infrastructure, including the installation of a 2 MW
rooftop solar plant at the Satna Unit, a 500 KW
rooftop solar plant at the Goa Unit, and the
procurement of 4 MW solar power through open
access, have yielded significant financial benefits.
These initiatives have not only led to a substantial
reduction in CO2 emissions but have also created
opportunities for cost savings and improved
profitability.
By enhancing energy efficiency and adopting
renewable energy sources, UCL can reduce
energy consumption and associated costs,
resulting in potential savings and increased
financial performance. Diversifying energy
sources and relying on alternative and renewable
energy options also mitigate the risks associated
with energy price fluctuations and reduce
dependence on conventional sources.
Furthermore, these investments in renewable
energy infrastructure, such as the rooftop solar
plants and outsourced solar power, can potentially
qualify for incentives, subsidies, and long-term
cost savings through reduced energy bills.
Overall, UCL’s commitment to effective energy
management not only aligns with its
environmental goals but also positively impacts
its financial performance and strengthens its
competitive position in the market.

sustainable practices enhances its reputation and
attracts environmentally conscious clients. This

Strategic
Opportunity
Sourcing
The categorisation of Workforce Health and
Safety as a risk is based on the high fatality
and injury rates in the EPC industry compared
to other sectors, as well as the increased
vulnerability of temporary workers due to lack
of training and experience. Failing to
effectively manage these risks can result in
human suffering, legal liabilities, and financial
costs.
The categorisation of Materials Sourcing as
an opportunity is based on the potential to
reduce direct and indirect greenhouse gas
emissions and integrate value chain partner
considerations effectively into the Company’s
business strategy. By strategically selecting
suppliers with lower carbon footprints,
promoting sustainable practices, and
incorporating responsible supply chain
management, the Company can enhance its
environmental 
reputation, 
attract
environmentally conscious customers, and
meet the growing demand for sustainable
products and services. This opportunity aligns
with environmental sustainability goals,
enhances operational efficiency, and
positively impacts the Company’s long-term
financial performance.
The Company prioritises workforce
health and safety by implementing
comprehensive safety protocols,
providing regular training programs,
and fostering a strong safety
culture. By conducting risk
assessments, ensuring compliance
with occupational health and safety
regulations, and continuously
monitoring and improving safety
practices, the Company aims to
protect the well-being of its
employees. Through these efforts,
the Company seeks to minimise
accidents, injuries, and fatalities,
creating a safe and healthy work
environment while enhancing
employee morale, productivity, and
retention.
-
Negative
Workplace accidents and injuries can result in
increased costs, including medical expenses,
compensation claims, potential legal liabilities,
and regulatory fines. Additionally, such incidents
can lead to project delays, increased insurance
premiums, and reputational damage, impacting
the Company’s profitability and hindering its ability
to secure future projects
Positive
By strategically selecting suppliers with lower
carbon footprints and incorporating sustainable
practices, the Company can potentially reduce
costs associated with energy consumption, waste
management, and compliance with environmental
regulations. Furthermore, meeting the growing
demand for sustainable products and services can
open new market opportunities, attract
environmentally conscious customers, and
strengthen the Company’s competitive position.
Additionally, a positive environmental reputation
can enhance brand value and customer loyalty,
leading to increased sales and long-term financial
sustainability.

Performance of the entity against the
specific commitments, goals and
targets along-with reasons in case
the same are not met
The Company acknowledges its responsibility to make a positive impact on
communities by pinpointing the main areas of focus and the performance towards
the above commitments is monitored on a regular basis, and adequate actions are
taken, wherever required.
The performance of our goals set for the FY 2023-24 stands as below:
1.
Establishing and maintaining systematic sustainability databases: The Company
has initiated adequate steps in establishing comprehensive sustainability
databases. These databases will be instrumental in tracking and managing
sustainability-related data effectively. By organizing and centralizing this
information, the Company has improved its ability to report on sustainability
metrics and will lay a strong foundation for future reporting.
2.
Reducing electricity consumption from the grid: During the financial year 2023-
24, approximately 20% of the Company's total energy consumption was derived
from renewable sources, reflecting a significant stride in its sustainability efforts.
To further bolster this commitment, the Company has recently entered into a
Power Purchase Agreement with a power producer for an additional dedicated
supply from a 4 MW Wind-Solar Hybrid power plant. Upon the commencement
of electricity supply under the new agreement, the proportion of renewable
energy in the Company's overall consumption is expected to rise substantially,
potentially reaching up to 65%.
3.
Monitoring and evaluating E, S & G parameters: Monitoring and evaluating
Environmental (E), Social (S), and Governance (G) parameters has been a
priority for the Company. Evaluation of these metrics has provided valuable
insights into performance and risks related to sustainability issues. By actively
tracking these parameters, the Company remains proactive in addressing
sustainability challenges and aligns with its commitment to responsible corporate
citizenship.
4.
Strengthening the training division and educating employees: During the year,
the Company significantly increased the number or frequency of training
programs by about 88%.
5.
CO2 Emission Reduction in Manufacturing Activities: The Company has made
substantial progress in reducing CO2 emissions from its manufacturing activities.
Through the adoption of state-of-the-art technologies and practices, such as
efficient construction methods and use of sustainable materials, significant
reductions in CO2 emissions have been achieved. These efforts are aligned
with global initiatives to mitigate climate change and underscore the Company's
commitment to environmental sustainability in its operational practices.
6.
Ensuring Full Compliance with Policies and Zero Tolerance for Bribery and
Unethical Practices: The Zero tolerance for bribery and unethical practices is
fully functional and there were no reported cases in the last year. Upholding
the highest ethical standards remains a cornerstone of the Company's
operations. Comprehensive policies, rigorous training programs, and regular
monitoring mechanisms have been implemented to reinforce the Company's
commitment to integrity and transparency, earning trust among stakeholders
and setting a benchmark for ethical conduct within the industry.
7.
ESG Initiatives: The Company has embarked on several key ESG initiatives to
enhance sustainability. It has expanded its sewage treatment capacity by
installing two additional units alongside an existing 200 KL STP unit. Moreover,
the Company has proactively switched from CFC refrigerants to eco-friendly
HFCs in ACs, central AC units, and chillers across its facilities. Complementing
these efforts, the Company has implemented organic waste management
programs, focusing on collecting and composting organic waste, including food
scraps. This initiative aims to reduce environmental impact by minimising
methane emissions, recover valuable resources through composting, enhance
soil fertility for sustainable agriculture, and ensure public health protection by
mitigating disease and pest risks associated with organic waste. Each of these

In our commitment to environmental stewardship, during the financial year 2023-

Quality: Suppliers' products and services are rigorously assessed for performance, durability,
reliability, and industry compliance to ensure they meet the Company's high standards and

cost-effectiveness and competitiveness of pricing structures are scrutinized to strike a balance

Acid Batteries: We have implemented a buy-back policy with Original Equipment Manufacturers
(OEMs) for acid batteries. This ensures that these batteries are safely and environmentally
soundly disposed of, preventing any adverse effects on the environment.
•
Hazardous Waste: Our approach to hazardous waste is meticulous and strictly adheres to
guidelines and safety protocols. We dispose of hazardous waste through authorized recyclers,
ensuring that it is handled and processed in a safe and responsible manner.
•
Other Non-Hazardous Waste: For non-hazardous waste materials, we adopt a responsible
approach by selling them to trusted vendors. These vendors have the capability to handle
and utilize the materials appropriately, minimising waste and promoting resource efficiency.
Through these measures, we strive to effectively manage the waste generated within our operations,

PRINCIPLE 4: BUSINESSES SHOULD RESPECT THE INTERESTS OF AND BE RESPONSIVE TO ALL ITS STAKEHOLDERS
ESSENTIAL INDICATORS:
1.
Identification of stakeholders group:
The Company has implemented a stakeholder engagement framework to enhance the
identification process and improve engagement practices with stakeholders. This framework
aims to optimize stakeholder engagement, which is vital for preserving the Company's reputation,
building trust, and delivering value to all stakeholders.
The stakeholder engagement framework consists of two key dimensions: the stakeholder's
interests and their level of influence. By considering these dimensions, the Company can
effectively identify stakeholders and tailor engagement strategies to suit their specific needs
and expectations.
In addition to these dimensions, the Company employs various criteria to identify stakeholder
groups. These criteria include:
a)
Dependency: Evaluating the level of reliance stakeholders have on the Company.
b)
Responsibility: Assessing the extent of stakeholders' obligations or duties towards the
Company.
c)
Attention: Considering the level of attention the Company gives to stakeholders.
d)
Influence: Gauging the impact stakeholders can exert on the Company.
By applying this stakeholder engagement framework and considering these criteria, the Company
can prioritise the most critical stakeholders and develop targeted engagement plans that align
with their interests and objectives. This approach ensures constructive and meaningful
relationships with stakeholders and enables the achievement of strategic goals.

Mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge:
The Company has implemented a Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) system at its
manufacturing units located at Satna (M.P.) and Verna (Goa). This mechanism
ensures that no liquid waste is discharged from the facility.
Water is primarily used for cooling purposes in the plant's operations and is circulated
within a closed loop, without any release of industrial effluent into the environment.
Additionally, the domestic wastewater generated within the facility is treated in a
Sewage Treatment Plant (STP), and the resulting treated water is then employed for
horticultural purposes within the Company premises. This ensures a sustainable
and environmentally conscious approach to water management within the
organisation.
