Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues
 
 
Please indicate material responsible business conduct and sustainability issues pertaining to environmental and social 
matters that present a risk or an opportunity to your business, rationale for identifying the same, approach to adapt or 
mitigate the risk along-with its financial implications, as per the following format
S.

(R/O)
Rationale for

In case of risk, approach to

Financial 
implications of the 
risk or opportunity 
(Indicate positive 
or negative 
implications)
Human Capital 
Development
Risk and 
Opportunity
Opportunity: As a key 
player in a knowledge 
industry, our human 
capital is a major source of 
strength and competitive 
advantage. Continuous up 
skilling will enable us to 
strengthen our leadership 
position and combat all 
challenges facing the 
industry in a better way.
Risk: In the current 
competitive scenario and 
rapidly changing marketing 
conditions, it is a challenge 
to retain the key talent.
LIC is a mammoth Trans National 
organization with approximately one 
lac employees. On account of the size 
and geographical spread as well as 
keeping with the personnel policies 
there is continuous vertical and lateral 
movement in the organisation. All 
these factors necessitate that there 
has to be a continuous process of 
skill development and upscaling the 
knowledge base within the organization. 
The pandemic situation necessitated 
and propelled the organization to move 
towards self learning through digital 
mode. This has enabled standardized 
content without dependence on 
physical infrastructure and facilitators 
and is available anywhere any time 
on intranet/internet on Chrome/Firefox 
web browsers. The current focus has 
been to make communication and 
collaboration easily available as part of 
the new work experience.
Further, with the aim of self-learning/
self-skilling, a Learning Management 
System, “LIC Gyanpeeth” was 
introduced for the employees.
High employee turnover 
may lead to decrease in 
productivity, increase in 
hiring cost, particularly 
arising from recruitments 
at Senior Levels and 
low employee morale in 
general.

reducing paper usage.
 
 Minimizing the use of single use plastic folders/bottles, replacing plastic folders with paper folders, plastic pots for plants with 
earthen pots, supply of paper pens in some offices, once the refill is over, these pens with seeds at the reverse can be planted 
to grow plants. Replacing disposable cups by stainless steel coffee/tea mugs for employees in some of the offices.

appoints an e-waste disposal vendor who picks up the hardware from all the locations after dismantling/ degaussing and gives 
a certificate in Form-2 to the concerned LIC office. We have disposed 116 metric tonnes of e-waste in the financial year 2023-
24 and 337 metric tonnes of e-waste in 2022-23.

we are sending premium due intimation to the policyholders by post, in order to keep policies in force and to enable 
the customer to enjoy the insurance benefits under the policy. SMS are sent to customers to be careful with fraudsters.
