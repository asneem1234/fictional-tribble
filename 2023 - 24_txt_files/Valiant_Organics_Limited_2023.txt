Increased heat 
waves 
Risk 
The recognition stems 
from 
the 
potential 
adverse effects of rising 
temperatures 
and 
prolonged heat waves on 
employee/workers’ 
health and safety. 
In response to this risk, the 
Company is implementing 
several proactive measures. 
These 
include 
the 
construction of shaded areas 
to 
reduce 
surface 
temperatures and provide 
additional rest spots for the 
workforce. Furthermore, it 
is 
enhancing 
ventilation 
systems 
and 
reinforcing 
facility structures to better 
withstand extreme weather 
conditions. These initiatives 
demonstrate the Company’s 
commitment to ensuring a 
safe and secure working 
environment in the face of 
evolving 
climatic 
challenges.

2 
Water Scarcity 
Risk 
The 
identification 
is 
based on the potential 
impact of water scarcity, 
reduced 
rainfall, 
or 
droughts 
on 
the 
production 
processes, 
given that water is a 
critical resource for the 
Company’s operations. 
The plant locations are 
strategically 
situated 
in 
industrial zones where water 
supply is guaranteed by the 
Government, 
thereby 
minimizing inherent risks. 
Moreover, 
each 
plant 
location is equipped with 
water 
storage 
facilities 
capable 
of 
maintaining 
reserves equivalent to a 
week's 
worth 
of 
water 
requirement, 
ensuring 
operational 
continuity 
during 
extreme 
emergencies. 
These 
measures underscore the 
Company’s proactive stance 
in 
safeguarding 
against 
water-related 
disruptions

New 
Environment 
Friendly Products 
Opportunity 
This is recognized from 
the rising demand for 
products free of 'forever 
chemicals'. 
Globally, 
regulatory frameworks 
are evolving to limit the 
use of chemicals across 
industries 
such 
as 
agriculture, 
pharmaceuticals, 
and 
food. This shift towards 
sustainability presents a 
growing 
market 
opportunity 
for 
companies that can offer 
environmentally 
friendly 
alternatives. 
There 
is 
increasing 
consumer preference for 
these 'greener' products,

the 
Company to capitalize

c. Hazardous waste 
d. Other waste 
 
The Company is committed to sustainable waste management and environmental protection through 
adoption of leading technologies and industry best practices.  
 
The Company operates zero liquid discharge mechanism at five out of six plants, ensuring that the 
wastewater is recycled and reused. Advanced effluent treatment and sewage treatment plants have been 
commissioned to eliminate hazardous effluent discharge, adhering to the norms set by respective state 
pollution control boards. 
 
The Company follows comprehensive waste management mechanisms such as SCARA and employs the 3R 
(Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) philosophy. It has partnered with authorized vendors for waste recycling and 
disposal and uses GPS systems to track waste from premises to landfill sites in addition to maintaining 
detailed logs and records of waste given to the accredited agencies.  
 
The Company has installed machinery like ATFD (Agitated Thin Film Dryer) to reduce sludge treatment 
along with RO and SPRO systems for water treatment. The solid waste generated is sent for landfilling, and 
calcium chloride is sent for recycling/or reuse in other industry sectors through authorized dealers. 
 
Through the above measures, the Company ensures that water and hazardous waste are treated, reused, or 
properly disposed of, minimizing their environmental impact. 
 
In the manufacturing units of the Company, plastic and e-waste generation is very limited and it is treated 
in accordance with waste management norms and through authorized/accredited agencies.

Accessibility of workplaces  
Are the premises / offices of the entity accessible to differently abled employees and workers, as per the 
requirements of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016? If not, whether any steps are being 
taken by the entity in this regard. 
 
Since the Company operates in the chemical sector which involves dealing with hazardous chemicals, raw 
materials and waste, it is extremely difficult to employ differently-abled individuals at its plants.   
 
Currently, the Company has already employed differently-abled individuals at its head office and ensures that 
basic facilities such as signage, elevators, etc. are available for them.  
 
The Company is continuously working towards enhancing its infrastructure to eliminate barriers to 
accessibility at all its locations.

Other than Permanent workers 
 
The policy covers a range of grievances, including those related to 
discrimination, harassment, bullying, and other employment-related 
concerns. Employees and workers are encouraged to first identify 
and address grievances informally if comfortable doing so, or 
escalate the issue to their manager or another senior person if 
necessary. Formal complaints can be made in writing, detailing the 
incident, involved parties, and any witnesses. 
 
Once a formal complaint is lodged, the grievance will be handled 
confidentially and impartially, with measures in place to protect 
employees from victimization. An investigation will be conducted 
by the HR team, involving interviews with the complainant, the 
accused, and any relevant witnesses. If the grievance is substantiated, 
appropriate actions such as apologies, warnings, counselling, or 
disciplinary measures up to termination may be taken. If 
unsubstantiated or found to be vexatious, the complainant will be 
informed, and appropriate actions will be taken. 
 
The Company is committed to ensuring a respectful, fair, and 
supportive working environment and continuously works to improve 
infrastructure and employee engagement processes to eliminate any 
barriers to accessibility for the entire workforce.

8. 
Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide 
details.  
 
During the FY, the Company implemented several initiatives aimed at enhancing operational efficiency and 
sustainability, thereby contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.  
 
Among these initiatives, the Agitated Thin Film Evaporator (ATFE) installation optimizes product recovery 
from distillation column outputs, significantly improving resource utilization and minimizing waste 
generation. By achieving higher product recovery rates with a single-pass evaporation process and minimizing 
heat exposure, the ATFE reduces energy consumption compared to traditional methods, indirectly lowering 
GHG emissions associated with energy production. 
 
Similarly, the Mechanical Vapor Recompression (MVR) system concentrates wastewater efficiently without 
external steam input, reducing the volume of wastewater that would otherwise require energy-intensive 
treatment processes. This not only conserves water resources but also reduces the GHG emissions associated 
with wastewater treatment. 
 
Additionally, the Reverse Osmosis (RO) system purifies stormwater to meet quality standards, ensuring 
sustainable water management practices. While primarily focused on water quality improvement, the RO 
system indirectly contributes to GHG emission reduction by optimizing water use efficiency and reducing the 
energy demand for water purification processes. 
 
Furthermore, the Agitated Thin Film Dryer (ATFD) used at the MEE Plant plays a significant role in waste 
management by evaporating effluent and reducing waste volume. This helps in compliance with 
environmental regulations while indirectly supporting GHG emission reduction efforts through improved 
waste handling and reduced landfill emissions. 
 
These initiatives complement the Company's existing measures, such as the upgrade to energy-efficient LED 
lighting, which has already reduced daily energy consumption and generated cost savings. Moreover, the 
utilization of solar panels and wind energy at Jhagadia Unit 1 further underscores the Company's commitment 
to transition to renewable energy sources.  
 
Through these efforts, the Company has enhanced operational efficiency whilst also contributing to mitigating 
climate change and promoting environmentally responsible business operations.
