1.
Rising fuel 
costs
Risk
Day by day, fossil fuel availability and its 
price are getting inversely proportionate. 
Blue Dart being in Air Express industry, 
the price hikes in fuel automatically 
indicates an effect on Aviation Turbine 
Fuel (ATF) and diesel, a big part of our 
business.
The air cargo industry has to work 
towards improving its sustainability 
through the use of alternative fuels, 
including sustainable aviation fuel 
(SAF). While traditional jet fuel is still 
being used, sustained efforts are being 
made towards developing and testing 
alternative fuels. 
To combat the price hikes, Blue Dart 
has an internal hedging mechanism viz; 
Fuel Surcharge Mechanism and follows 
a Fuel Surcharge Calculation method in 
Domestic and Regional services that is 
computed based on the Brent index.

2.
Labour 
Practices
Risk
The Air Freight & Logistic industry’s 
reliance 
on 
independent 
Service 
Providers, mainly for courier services, 
has come under increasing regulatory 
scrutiny. Independent Service Providers 
may not be covered under the same laws 
that protect employees. Companies in 
the Industry may face legal actions from 
employee and service provider claims 
regarding wage payments, benefits, 
and working conditions. This may also 
negatively affect reputation and ability 
to hire and retain employees, reducing 
operational efficiency and increasing 
turnover costs.
Efforts are being made to ensure 
health check of compliance status of 
third party Service Providers so as 
business integrity and continuity of Blue 
Dart remains intact. We also have the 
practice of obtaining ‘Supplier Code

Employee 
Health & 
Safety
Risk
Employees in the Air Freight & Logistics 
industry may be exposed to dangerous 
working conditions, including accidents 
resulting from mechanical failure or 
human error. Additionally, moving 
packages manually is a physical 
process that requires special training in 
order to minimize injury. While the fatal 
occupational injury rate for trucking 
workers is higher than average, worker 
safety issues in aviation are highly 
regulated, which raises the risk of fines 
or penalties when an incident occurs. 
Health and safety incidents may 
result in work stoppages and a range 
of costs, from medical expenses to 
workers compensation. Such incidents 
can also reduce productivity, and 
thus revenues, if employees believe 
their safety and well-being are not 
being prioritized. Finally, companies 
with poor safety records may also 
face increased insurance premiums 
and higher costs of capital, as well 
as reputational damage that could 
reduce revenue and market share.
Blue Dart endeavors to mitigate 
these impacts by providing adequate 
protection and training for employees, 
ensuring mechanical equipments are 
safely functioning, and Institutionalizing 
a culture of safety within the workplace.

5.
GHG 
Emissions 
& Health 
hazard
Risk
Companies in the Logistics industry 
generate direct greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions that contribute to climate 
change. Emissions are generated from 
fuel combustion by both air and road 
freight operations. Given the altitude of 
the emissions from jet fuel, air freight 
makes an especially potent contribution 
to climate change. Management of 
GHG emissions is likely to affect air 
freight and logistics companies’ cost 
structure over time, as emissions are 
tied directly to fuel use, and thus to 
operating expenses. Fuel efficiency 
and the use of alternative fuels offers 
a way for companies to reduce fuel 
costs and/or limit exposure to volatile 
fuel pricing, future regulatory costs, and 
other consequences of GHG emissions. 
While newer aircraft and trucks are 
generally more fuel-efficient, existing 
fleets may be retrofitted. The industry’s 
primary air emissions include sulfur 
oxides (SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx), 
and particulate matter (PM), which have 
localized negative effects on air quality 
and human health. This would in turn 
force Blue Dart to increase operating 
costs or make investments to modernize 
our fleets due to regulatory pressure, 
customer demand, and rising fuel costs.
Capital investments in more fuel-
efficient airplanes and/or vehicles and 
emerging fuel-management technology 
may potentially reduce ongoing fuel 
expenses and improve profitability. It 
can also help Blue Dart to potentially 
capture market share of customers 
seeking low-carbon shipping solutions. 
As a part of this, Blue Dart has been 
promoting the use of electric vehicles 
in its fleet.

Supply Chain 
Management
Risk
Many companies in the Logistics 
& Air Freight industry contract with 
large, complex networks of asset-
based third-party providers to provide 
freight transportation services to their 
customers. Contracting is especially 
common among companies providing 
freight forwarding, logistics, brokerage, 
and intermodal services. These Service 
Providers range across all modes 
of transport such as motor carriers, 
railroads, air freight, and ocean carriers.
Blue Dart has put in review systems 
in place to manage the relationships 
with their Service Providers in order to 
ensure that service provider actions that 
lead to environmental or social impacts 
do not result in material adverse effects 
on their own operations, such as 
decreased brand value. Continuous 
evaluations, inspections and control 
measures are being adopted by Blue 
Dart to mitigate the risk.

Critical 
Incident Risk 
Management
Risk
In the logistics industry, all modes of 
transportation pose safety risks. In 
some cases, mechanical failure or 
human error may lead to accidents 
with significant environmental or social 
consequences, including regulatory 
action and lawsuits from impacted 
communities or customers. Blue Dart 
faces this risk especially considering its’ 
countrywide presence.
While the stringency of regulatory 
requirements may vary by the region 
of operation, Blue Dart strives to 
maintain the highest safety standards 
throughout our global operations and 
tries to minimize the risks of safety 
incidents that affect our reputation and 
profitability.

12.	Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy work place.32
	
In addition to welfare and health, Blue Dart is equally concerned about the safety of its Workforce. Employees receive essential training focused 
on understanding hazard analysis relevant to each job and process. The organization has taken multiple measures, placing a significant 
emphasis on the health and safety of the workforce. To address the issue of road safety and minimize accidents, the Company conducts 
daily ‘Performance Dialogues’ at the start of each shift, emphasizing safety practices and the importance of wearing helmets. Employees are 
educated through training programs to recognize potential hazards specific to their roles and processes. It is compulsory for all bikers to wear 
helmets, and failure to comply results in appropriate disciplinary measures. The Company also maintains a monthly log and supervision of any 
incidents related to work or road accidents. Incidents from the prior day are reviewed during ‘Performance Dialogues’ to ensure that proactive 
and reactive measures are in place. Moreover, employees are offered additional health insurance benefits.

Corporate office: 
	
Blue Dart is leading the charge towards sustainable practices, actively pursuing initiatives that demonstrate our unwavering commitment to 
environmental responsibility. One such initiative is our exploration of Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) technology, a cutting-edge approach aimed 
at eliminating liquid discharge from our facilities. Concurrently, we are implementing a range of initiatives that underscore our dedication to 
environmental stewardship.
	
At the forefront of these efforts are our rainwater harvesting systems, strategically installed across our facilities. These systems are designed to 
capture and store rainwater, serving as a sustainable solution that not only reduces our reliance on traditional water sources but also contributes 
to local water conservation efforts. Additionally, we are proud to incorporate water tap aerators, innovative devices that regulate water flow 
by infusing air into the stream. This simple yet effective measure significantly reduces water consumption, showcasing our commitment to 
exceeding environmental standards.
	
These initiatives are not just about meeting regulatory requirements; they represent our proactive stance in embracing eco-friendly solutions. 
By setting new benchmarks in responsible corporate practices, we aim to make a tangible difference in the well-being of our communities and 
the preservation of our environment. At Blue Dart, sustainability isn't just a goal—it's a core value that drives us to continuously innovate and 
lead the way towards a greener, more sustainable future.

Blue Dart has undertaken various initiatives to reduce its GHG footprint:
	
i.	 The integration of a 25 KWP rooftop solar system at Blue Dart Corporate office has yielded commendable environmental and financial 
outcomes. This sustainable initiative has led to a substantial reduction of CO2 emissions, demonstrating the company's commitment to 
mitigating its carbon footprint. Additionally, the solar power plant has generated 11,986.3 kWh of clean and renewable energy, contributing 
significantly to the company's green energy portfolio. Beyond environmental benefits, the solar initiative has translated into tangible 
financial savings, with `93,773/- saved in electricity costs.
	
ii.	 The introduction of motion sensors for LED light fittings has proven to be a highly effective energy-saving measure. With an annual 
reduction of 35,442 kWh units, this initiative has translated into significant cost savings of `4,25,303. 
	
iii.	 The adoption of 100% compostable garbage bags by Blue Dart Express Ltd. has yielded positive outcomes in terms of environmental 
impact and sustainable waste management. This initiative significantly reduces the use of traditional plastic bags, contributing to a decrease 
in plastic pollution and landfill waste.
	
iv.	 The in-house composting initiative has yielded positive outcomes in terms of waste reduction and environmental sustainability. By 
recycling a diverse range of organic materials, including vegetable and fruit peelings, eggshells, newspapers, cardboard, fallen leaves, 
plant pruning's, sawdust from in-house carpentry work, and tea and coffee grounds, we have successfully diverted substantial waste from 
landfills.
	
v.	 Through the "GoGreen" initiative, the Company has made significant strides in environmental conservation by planting a total of 777,000 
trees to date. This ongoing commitment is underscored by the annual planting of 111,000 trees, resulting in a collective offset of 1,55,40,000 
kilograms of carbon/year on maturity.
	
vi.	 The Company has embraced an eco-friendly initiative by adopting R410A refrigerant gas in its air conditioning systems. This strategic 
move is aligned with the company's commitment to environmental sustainability and responsible business practices. R410A, known for its 
lower environmental impact compared to traditional refrigerants, helps reduce the company's carbon footprint.
