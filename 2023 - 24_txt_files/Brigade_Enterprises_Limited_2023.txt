1
Water 
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity 
With increasing 
urbanisation, 
water scarcity is 
projected to rise. 
Given that real 
estate development 
is a water-
intensive industry, 
it is essential to 
implement robust 
water management 
practices to 
ensure sustainable 
business 
operations.
Our commitment to sustainable water 
management is demonstrated through 
our vision and targets a) Water positive 
organisation by 2030. b) Increase 
wastewater recycling by 10% YoY. 
Our approach is to achieve this 
through a) water conservation, water 
optimisation through water efficient 
fixtures, planning for design through 
assessments of water stress. 
b) recyle and resue to help reduce 
our dependence on fresh water. 
We use IoT based tools for real-time 
water monitoring and leak detection. 
Similarly for Commercial and Hospitality 
verticals, water efficiency projects and 
resuse & recyle approach helps in 
water reduction. 
Risk-Negative: 
Higher cost of 
purchasing water; 
Drought situations 
that can disrupt 
water supplies. 
Opportunity-
Positive: While 
there is an initial 
cost, but in the 
long term, efforts 
for effective water 
management will 
help in optimising 
costs for the 
buildings.
2
Green 
House Gas 
Emissions 
(GHG)
Risk and 
Opportunity
Climate change 
poses significant 
transitional and 
physical risks. 
Transitional risks 
may lead to 
regulatory changes, 
additional costs 
for renewable 
energy etc. Physical 
risks require to be 
addressed and 
incorporated at the 
building design 
stage, which can 
increase costs. 
Property values 
can be impacted by 
extreme weather 
vulnerabilities or 
such perceptions.  
We are targetting Net Zero by 2045, 
and have committed to SBTi in 2024. 
To achieve these reductions, we are 
committed to green building norms 
for all buildings by 2030, and 100% 
renewables by 2040. 
Our comprehensive action plan 
addresses operational and embodied 
emissions by transitioning to renewable 
energy and enhancing energy 
efficiency with smart technologies. 
Risk-Negative:
Reducing emissions 
require energy 
efficient buildings, 
transition to 
renewables, 
and low carbon 
materials which can 
have huge financial 
implications.
Opportunity-
Positive: GHG 
reduction can 
help organisation 
reduce negative 
externalities, 
ensure stakeholder 
well-being, and 
become more 
climate conscious, 
ensuring long-term 
financial prosperity.

Business 
Conduct and 
Compliance
Opportunity
In a dynamic 
environment 
with large scale 
changes in 
environmental, 
social and 
governance 
expectations of 
stakeholders, it 
is crucial for any 
business to step 
up and disclose 
information that 
helps build trust. 
Our alignment 
with nine 
NGRBC (National 
Guidelines for 
Responsible 
Business Conduct) 
principles help 
in following 
a structured 
approach. 
Our ESG policy includes a three-
tier governance system to enhance 
integrity, efficiency, and stakeholder 
trust through transparency, active 
engagement, and adhering to industry 
best practices. 
We implement robust monitoring and 
reporting systems, enforce ethical 
compliance, foster innovation, and 
provide training for employees 
and suppliers. Pursuing industry 
certifications will validate our efforts.
Opportunity- 
Positive: 
Responsible 
business conduct 
not only enhances 
brand value and 
brand reputation 
but also saves cost 
associated with the 
non-compliance 
and infringement 
of the nine NGRBC 
principles.
4
ESG 
Governance
Opportunity
Effective 
management of 
ESG-related risks, 
fostering long-
term sustainability 
goals and to 
meet stakeholder 
expectations.
With the three-line ESG governance, 
we aim to drive sustainable growth, 
mitigate risks, and build a resilient 
and responsible business that meets 
the expectations of stakeholders and 
contributes positively to society and the 
environment.
We have set a target of achieving 50% 
gender diverse BoD by 2028;
ESG KPIs for key executives;
Board level traction for ESG areas of 
significance. 
Opportunity-
Positive: Effective 
ESG and good 
governance 
practices 
can enhance 
organisation’s value-
creating ability in 
the long-run for all 
its stakeholders, 
fostering 
organisational 
goodwill.

Health and 
Safety
Risk
Employee safety 
comes first and 
foremost. Any 
deviation on that 
leads to a setback 
for employee 
morale, leading to 
cost, productivity 
and reputational 
damage. It can also 
lead to additional 
liabilities. 
Brigade’s approach to occupational 
health and safety is holistic as follows:
a) extends to the entire employee and 
worker base. 
b) structured and systematic approach 
through ISO 45001 certification and 
maintaining systems and achieving 
results such as zero fatalities since 2018. 
c) train 100% of our staff by 2025 
(workers and employees) 
d) Comprehensive health programmes, 
e) WELL certification target for all 
commercial (lease and rentals) by 2028.
Risk- Negative: 
Occupational 
health and safety 
requires an 
effective OHSMS 
to be put in place, 
which is done 
through financial 
investment in 
OHS-related 
employee 
benefits, 
training, health 
programmes, 
capacity building, 
adequate 
infrastructure, 
etc. Any lapse 
in compliance 
can also pose 
significant 
reputational risk to 
the organisation.
6
Human 
Rights
Risk
As a large 
organisation, 
with an extensive 
workforce, supply 
chain and a 
large customer 
base, everyone’s 
rights need to be 
protected at all 
times. Any miss on 
the fundamental 
responsibility of 
maintaining human 
dignity remains a 
risk.
We are committed to respecting and 
upholding the human rights of all our 
stakeholders. We have set a target to 
achieve SMETA certification for key  
suppliers by 2025, demonstrating our 
dedication to ethical trade practices. 
Brigade plans to align its labour 
standards with the UNGP, ILO, and the 
Declaration on Fundamental Principles 
and Rights at Work framework by 2026.
Furthermore, Brigade Group intends to 
become a member of the UN Global 
Compact by 2028, reinforcing its 
commitment to global human rights 
standards.
Risk- Negative: 
Upholding and 
promoting Human 
Rights in the 
workplace is vital 
for employee 
and community 
well-being but 
requires certain 
financial costs to 
be incurred in the 
beginning which 
in turn reduces 
legal as well as 
reputational risk to 
the organisation, 
fostering long-
term social 
sustainability.

Tenants and 
Community
Opportunity
Managing tenants 
and communities 
offers opportunities 
to improve customer 
satisfaction, ensure 
long-term stability, 
mitigate risks, and 
cultivate a positive 
brand reputation.
We are committed to nurturing positive 
and lasting relationships with tenants 
and the community. We have set a 
target of sourcing more than 50% of 
materials locally. Furthermore, Brigade 
intends to introduce a Group-wide Net 
Promoter Score (NPS) by 2025 to gauge 
tenant satisfaction. We will integrate 
Green clauses into all our contracts

environmental sustainability.
Opportunity- 
Positive: 
Lower costs 
in marketing 
because of 
higher NPS, 
providing 
financial benefits.

Human 
Capital 
Development
Opportunity
Skilled and 
proficient 
employees are 
a valuable asset 
to the company. 
Investing in their 
development 
enhances 
performance and 
equips them to 
manage work-
related risks 
effectively. 
Our diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) 
policy promotes an equitable and secure 
workplace. DEI training highlights the 
advantages of diversity, while various 
programmes enhance employee and 
community skills. We use a hybrid 
training approach and third-party 
platforms such as Udemy, Coursera, 
and LinkedIn Learning. We assess 
effectiveness of these initiatives with the 
Kirkpatrick model.
Opportunity- 
Positive: 
Although costs 
have to be 
incurred in 
developing 
organisation’s 
human capital 
by investing 
in employee 
training, 
awareness 
programmes, 
employee 
benefits, etc.,  
The benefits 
provided by 
long-term 
value creation 
outweighs the 
short-term costs.

Materials
Risk
Materials have a 
huge impact on the 
overall life cycle 
emissions of a 
building. Additionally, 
considering the 
health attributes 
of materials, such 
as Volatile Organic 
Compounds (VOCs)
can lead to health 
repercussions for the 
occupants. 
We are committed to sustainable 
materials management through 
responsible procurement as outlined in 
our policy. We aim for Green building 
certification for all new projects. This 
encourages using recycled materials, 
reducing reliance on virgin resources 
and their environmental impact. We 
prioritize the health and sustainability of 
our workforce as well as the occupants 
with low-VOC paints for better indoor 
air quality. Our procurement policy 
includes a “Red List” which guides in 
eliminating hazardous substances and 
conflict materials, ensuring safety and 
compliance with industry standards.
Risk- Negative: 
Sustainable 
Materials 
Management 
practices 
including use 
of secondary 
raw materials 
(SRM), reusing 
and recycling 
practices, 
and LCA 
can be cost 
intensive for an 
organisation.

ESG Risk 
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity
Effective risk and 
crisis management 
is vital for long-term 
financial planning 
and organisational 
flexibility. Identifying 
relevant ESG risks 
and opportunities 
under the risk 
framework is very 
important to minimise 
and eliminate any 
reputational damage 
and operational 
challenges such 
as negative 
environmental or 
social incidents 
and supply chain 
disruption.
ESG Policy and ESG Risk Management 
Committee at the Board level provide 
oversight to ESG risks along with other 
enterprise risks. 
Our approach is to progressively 
integrate ESG risks in our enterprise 
risk strategy was initiated in 2024. 
As climate change is an emerging risk, 
reporting on climate, through Task 
Force on Climate-Related Financial 
Disclosures (TCFD) framework is 
helping in organisation mapping and 
reporting significant transitional and 
physical climate risks. 
Risk- Negative: 
Lack of 
understanding 
of ESG can 
have financial 
repercussions 
from investors, 
regulators, 
customers 
and other 
stakeholders 
along with 
increased 
spending 
on meeting 
climate-related 
goals such as 
net-zero.
Positive: Initial 
spending on 
environmental 
and social 
governance 
initiatives 
can work 
towards long 
term financial 
stability of the 
organisation.

Waste 
Management
Risk
Waste, if generated 
in high quantities 
and not disposed 
properly can 
lead to societal, 
environmental and 
reputational issues. 
Hazardous waste 
is a liability for 
organisations, if not 
disposed properly.
We design buildings with integrated 
waste management solutions, 
with a focus on reducing waste 
generation. We have set a target of 
adopting circularity by increasing 
resource reuse. Efforts are in place 
to minimise waste generation and 
reduce waste sent to landfills.
Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) 
Practices: At Brigade, we strictly 
follow Zero Liquid Discharge 
principles, ensuring that 96.6% 
of the water is recycled within a 
closed-loop system. This sustainable 
approach effectively prevents any 
adverse impact on groundwater and 
local ecosystems.
Risk- Negative: 
Proper treatment 
and disposal 
of waste in an 
environmentally 
sound manner 
requires financial 
investment 
in adequate 
infrastructure 
(STP, WTP, etc.) 
and adoption of 
resource efficient 
practices for waste 
reduction.
12
Biodiversity
Risk
In development 
projects, 
conversion of land 
from agricultural 
to commercial/
residential can 
lead to loss of 
biodiversity. 
Overall climate 
change is known 
to be triggering 
biodiversity losses 
owing to changes 
in ecological 
niches and 
extreme weather 
situations. 
Our approach is to mitigate risk 
through ensuring that the action 
plans are oriented for outweighing 
the impacts through a mitigation 
hierarchy by assessing biodiversity 
during EIA; avoiding and minimising 
impact; rehabilitating if there is any 
impact, or offsetting that at another 
place. 
We collaborate with local 
communities to enhance 
biodiversity, fostering stakeholder 
ownership and ensuring long-term 
success
Risk- Negative: 
Organisation 
needs to incur 
additional financial 
costs for managing 
and restoring 
biodiversity in and 
around the office 
spaces, fostering 
environmental 
sustainability.

Governance, leadership, and oversight
7. Statement by the director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges,   
    targets, and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
  
As we navigate the evolving landscape of the real estate sector, Brigade Group is resolute in its commitment to 
sustainability, recognising its pivotal role in driving positive environmental, social, and governance (ESG) outcomes. Our 
dedication to responsible land use, the well-being of our workforce, and the satisfaction of our customers underscores 
every decision we make. We are convinced that integrating sustainable practices not only enhances our profitability but 
also secures our long-term growth and resilience.
This year, we have increased our efforts to address the pressing challenges of climate change, resource efficiency, and 
social equity. Climate change needs to be understood by our stakeholders and that communication for different sets of 
audiences is daunting.
Our strategic sustainability vision is calibrated along three pillars to scale new heights for a sustainable future with 
ambitious targets across three core pillars.
1. Scaling sustainable operations for the planet:  
We have set a science-based net zero target and our operations to be 100% renewable by 2040. We have already filed 
our official commitment to SBTi. We have set a target of becoming water-positive by 2030 and a 10% increase YoY in 
wastewater recycling, which is on track. As per our target, sustainable procurement policy implementation is in place, and 
we will work towards increasing the use of green-certified materials. We have formulated a biodiversity policy and a target 
of increasing biodiversity by 10% in real estate development sites is on track.
2. Scaling livable spaces for communities:
We are developing spaces that improve the quality of life of communities. We are providing a healthy and safe working 
environment to our employees and workers, and we strive to build positive and long-lasting relationships with tenants 
and the community. We have targeted 100% training coverage for all employees on occupational health and safety. We 
have numerous women-centric leadership programmes and increased the overall training hours. We have set a target of 
having all lease and rental buildings to be WELL-certified by 2028.
3. Scaling good governance for shareholders:
By conducting our business with the utmost integrity and good governance, we are working towards establishing a strong 
governance framework to manage ESG goals. We practice high standards of business ethics. We also measure and 
monitor all material risks including ESG risks and are working on mitigating the risks.
In the past year, we have made notable progress in these areas, achieving significant reductions in energy consumption, 
advancing our sustainable construction techniques, and launching impactful community programmes. Our efforts have 
been recognised through various sustainability awards and certifications, reinforcing our position as a leader in the 
industry.

10. Health and safety management system:
a. Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Yes/ No). 
If yes, the coverage such system? 
Yes. As a property development and management entity, having a robust Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) 
Management System is paramount to mitigate health and safety risks effectively. This system aids in establishing clear 
protocols and comprehensive practices across both office spaces and construction sites. The organisation holds an ISO 
45001:2018 certification for its OHS Management System, ensuring a methodical approach to identifying, assessing, and 
monitoring health and safety risks and opportunities.
36
BRSR  2023-24
b. What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis 
by the entity?
Brigade Group adopts a proactive approach towards identifying and addressing occupational hazards and risks, which 
encompass a wide array of factors including physical, chemical, and biological elements originating from sources such 
as machinery, hazardous substances, noise, stress, and ergonomic issues. ISO 45001:2018 certified OHS management 
system outlines procedures and protocols to be adhered to across all managed premises and construction sites, 
ensuring compliance with relevant laws and regulations.
Within this system, potential hazards and associated control measures are meticulously identified, categorised based on 
severity and likelihood, and monitored using lagging and leading indicators such as incident reduction, near misses, first 
aid instances, unsafe acts, and conditions. Regular hazard identification and risk assessments (HIRA) are conducted at 
all real estate development sites prior to commencing both routine and non-routine activities, with reviews and revisions 
occurring biannually as necessary.
Control measures implemented include elimination, substitution, engineering and administrative controls, and personal 
protective equipment, with safety nets, lifelines, and fall arrestor systems among those utilised on-site. Daily site 
inspections ensure compliance, with exemplary workers recognized through a “Helmet of Honour” incentive scheme. 
Regular safety and equipment handling training, along with adherence to daily checklists, permits, and formats, ensure 
process quality.
For managed properties, employees and workers receive comprehensive safety training and emergency response 
protocols, with periodic mock drills conducted for scenarios such as fires and earthquakes. Guests and tenants are 
briefed on building safety measures, while routine maintenance checks are carried out on elevators, escalators, and 
machinery to guarantee the safety and well-being of all stakeholders.
Health and safety assessments within the organisation utilize a standardized severity versus likelihood framework to 
evaluate risks, leading to the development of necessary mitigation strategies. Through regular analysis of health and 
safety performance across all offices and construction sites, areas for enhancement are identified and addressed.
The Group extends coverage of its OHS Management System to all employees, including those under contract in the 
property development sector.
c. Whether you have processes for workers to report the work related hazards and to remove themselves from such 
risks. (Y/N)
Yes. Worker participation in occupational health and safety happens through joint management-worker health and 
safety committees. The committees have representation from all job levels. Consultation is a two-way process between 
employers and workers where both can talk to each other about health and safety matters - listen to and raise concerns 
- seek and share views and information. We take feedback from workers before decisions are made. 
Workers are provided access to communication systems for sharing their concerns either directly or through indirect 
communication. Everyday toolbox talks are a direct communication mode available to the workers. Workers are 
encouraged to communicate to their supervisors during site walks and safety committee meetings.
37
BRSR  2023-24
d. Do the employees/ worker of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services? 
(Yes/ No)
Yes. The company goes beyond basic safety to ensure worker well-being. Weekly doctor visits and monthly medical 
camps provide easy access to non-occupational medical care. Every project site has a medical room staffed by a nurse, 
ready to assist with emergencies. Additionally, partnerships with nearby hospitals guarantee access to advanced care if 
needed.
The company takes a proactive approach to worker health by offering programmes that address major non-work-related 
health concerns. These programmes raise awareness of critical issues like healthy eating, smoking cessation, substance 
abuse, staying active

Leadership Indicators
1. Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and 
social topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.
In 2022-23, Brigade re-evaluated its key sustainability topics. We examined the regulatory environment we operate 
in, including global standards and frameworks such as GRI, S&P, SASB, and MSCI, as well as emerging industry trends 
in sustainability. Additionally, we analyzed our competitive landscape and considered the expectations of our key 
stakeholder groups including customers, shareholders, partners, and employees. Consultation with stakeholders on 
economic, environmental, and social topics is henceforth crucial in evaluating our key material topics and is facilitated 
through various committees and engagement mechanisms at the Brigade such as the Risk Management Committee 
and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Committee. The Risk Management Committee oversees the integration of 
sustainability risks into the Group’s risk management process and ensures regular communication and consultation with 
stakeholders, whereas the CSR Committee formulates CSR strategies and recommends them to the Board. Feedback 
from these consultations is then provided to the Board for approval and implementation.
2. Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, and 
social topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these 
topics were incorporated into policies and activities of the entity.
Yes, stakeholder consultations were conducted in 2022-23 to identify the material topics which are of high priority and 
have maximum impact on the business. These high material areas formed the foundation of our ESG strategy and the 
cornerstone for the identification and development of our three ESG pillars and 31 different targets for excellence in 
environmental, social, and governance areas. In the current reporting period, we continue to work on the previously 
identified goal areas.
3. Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/ 
marginalized stakeholder groups. 
Brigade Group addressed concerns of vulnerable and marginalized stakeholders through several initiatives. We have 
implemented a Human Rights Policy, extended to all employees, suppliers, and partners, which prohibits child labour 
and workplace discrimination while promoting diversity and inclusion​. Training sessions on human rights, child labour, 
and anti-discrimination were conducted for 90% of employees​. Additionally, Brigade Foundation supported marginalized 
communities by providing skill development and healthcare facilities​. Complaints and violations can be reported 
anonymously via formalized channels​.

5. Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues.
The Group prioritises managing human rights issues due to the financial, operational, and reputational risks posed by 
non-compliance. To address this, the organisation has a robust internal mechanism to identify, evaluate, and resolve 
human rights concerns.
Human Rights Compliance:
Human rights are integrated into the Group’s risk management framework, with internal operations evaluated against 
both national and international standards such as:
- United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights
- International Labour Organisation Declaration on the Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work
- National Guidelines on Responsible Business Conduct
These human rights standards are also extended to external partners. The Group’s Supplier Code of Conduct enables 
all value chain partners to adhere to regulations such as:
- Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act 1970
- Minimum Wages Act 1948
- Payment of Wages Act 1936 and other local regulations related to fair wages, health, safety, and worker welfare
Grievance Redressal System:
Customers can raise human rights concerns through the here4you@brigadegroup.com interface or by direct written 
communication with the Ethics Committee. Shareholders can send their grievances to investors@brigadegroup.com. 
The Group’s Whistleblower Policy provides contact details (physical address, email, and telephone numbers) for internal 
stakeholders (employees and directors) to report issues. All reported concerns are thoroughly investigated, with 
outcomes communicated to the involved parties within 45 days of receipt.
Escalation Matrix:
Serious complaints are escalated to the Audit Committee. In cases of violations, the Ethics Committee instructs the 
Human Resources department, led by the Chief Human Resources Officer, to take action. Employees can report highly 
sensitive concerns directly to the Audit Committee Chairman at chairmanauditcommitteebel@gmail.com.
Training and Awareness:
All employees and workers receive training on human rights. These sessions include information on the organisation’s 
confidentiality policy and protection against retaliation for complainants. Training programmes conducted during the 
reporting period include:
1. Prevention ofSexual Harassment (PoSH) e-learning course
2. PoSH refresher
3. Internal Committee (IC) Refresher training
4. Labour compliances
Department heads are required to communicate the whistleblower policy details to their teams, and the Human 
Resources department ensures new hires are informed. The policy is also available on the HR Connect platform and 
the company website.

8. Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases
At Brigade Group, we have established comprehensive measures to safeguard individuals who report incidents of 
harassment and discrimination. Our organisation is committed to fostering a safe and inclusive environment, ensuring 
effective resolutions, and protecting the rights and well-being of all complainants.  
Policies such as the Code of Ethics, Whistleblower, and Human Rights, outline prohibited behaviours, the organisation’s 
perspective, emphasis on reporting incidents, and the assurance of confidentiality. The Whistleblower Policy aims to 
ensure that employees who report any unacceptable, improper, or unethical practices are protected from retaliatory 
actions. This includes protection against discrimination, harassment, and any other unfair employment practices such as 
threats, intimidation, transfers, demotions, or denial of promotions.  
Reporting systems
The organisation’s grievance redressal system follows a formal due diligence process to evaluate the authenticity of 
the complaint. It ensures a dialogue-based approach to arrive at mutually agreed solutions and implements relevant 
measures to improve the mechanism and prevent future harm. The Ethics and the Internal Committee ensure that the 
parties involved engage fairly and respectfully and that the investigation’s outcome aligns with national and international 
norms.
9. Do human rights requirements from part of you business agreements and contracts? (Yes/No)
Yes. All suppliers, vendors, contractors, their employees, subsidiaries, affiliates, and subcontractors are required to 
adhere to our ‘Supplier Code of Conduct’.
They must also comply with all applicable laws and regulations of the countries and regions in which they operate.  
Suppliers, sub-contractors, and sub-vendors are required to abide by all applicable laws and regulations pertaining to 
statutory issues like working hours, minimum wages, child labour, working conditions, forced/bonded compulsory labour, 
slavery, occupational health and safety, and legal employment age. They are required to implement fair, humane, and 
non-discriminatory employment practices and have suitable mechanisms and grievance-handling procedures in place to 
enable their employees to raise concerns and complaints directly with their management.
The Group reserves the right to conduct (scheduled and unscheduled) audits to assess suppliers’ compliance with 
requirements. If the supplier is found non-compliant, suitable corrective action would be implemented within specified 
timelines.

some initiatives undertaken by the organisation to reduce Green House Gas (GHG) emissions during the reporting period:
Energy Efficiency and Conservation:
Energy conservation and environmental protection are integral to the Brigade Group’s real estate design and 
development. The organisation focuses on creating energy-efficient spaces to reduce Green House Gas (GHG) emissions 
by:
•	
Incorporating energy efficiency and sustainability into building design, reducing heat loss through energy-efficient 
planning, sun path, and daylighting simulation and modelling.
•	
Using Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) Star-rated electro-mechanical equipment (e.g., pumps, drives, compressors) in 
projects.
•	
Adopting Green Building norms as per LEED and IGBC in all projects.
•	
Implementing effective rooftop rainwater and stormwater harvesting systems in all projects to conserve water and 
energy.
•	
Installing energy-efficient light fixtures, and LED lights with motion sensors, timers, and dimmers across all projects.
•	
Using occupancy sensors in rarely used areas such as restrooms, changing rooms, corridors, staircases, parking, and 
basements.
•	
Incorporating passive architectural features such as planting tall trees for shading, designing fixed shading devices on 
building facades, ensuring cross ventilation for air circulation, and using solar reflective paints on rooftops to reduce 
energy demand for cooling systems.
•	
Providing charging points for electric vehicles to encourage the use of alternative fuels and reduce dependence on 
fossil fuels.
Use of Renewable Energy:
Indirect emissions from purchased electricity consumption are a significant source of Green House Gas (GHG) emissions. 
To reduce these emissions, the Group has:
•	
Sourced 8% of its total energy consumption from renewable sources during the reporting period.
•	
Utilised solar energy for water heating and lighting in projects and harnessed solar energy through solar PV panels at 
all commercial projects.
•	
Procured green power through long-term agreements with green energy developers, encouraging the installation of 
renewable energy systems and providing clean energy for clients and occupants.
Sustainable Procurement:
The Group has adopted a Sustainable Sourcing policy that emphasizes using green-certified materials and prioritizing 
local sources. During the reporting period, the Group sourced 98% of its construction material domestically.

At Brigade Group we have a well-defined Business Continuity and Disaster Management policy.
This policy aims to manage or mitigate risks or uncertainties that may disrupt business as usual. The policy seeks to 
document the business procedures necessary to keep our operations running both under normal conditions and during 
times of emergency.
Our Disaster Management and Business Continuity Policy ensures the security of personnel, data, and resources during 
disruptive situations. We have developed comprehensive guidance on handling catastrophes and disasters that may 
impact our operations and facilitate a swift return to business as usual. This includes defining and prioritizing risks and 
enabling teams to create robust risk mitigation strategies for disaster identification, response, and recovery. We establish 
action plans to address identified risks and maintain a continuous supply chain between upstream and downstream op­
erations. Additionally, we keep communication channels open for transactions and discussions with clients and partners, 
ensuring adherence to all relevant legal, regulatory, and contractual obligations.
