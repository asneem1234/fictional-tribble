Message From the MD & CEO on Sustainability 
 
Dear Shareholders, 
 
 
We are delighted to publish our Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) for the 
Financial Year 2023-24. We believe that the organisations that promote sustainability are more 
likely to attract customers who value these principles and are willing to do business with 
institutions that share their values. Sustainability and resilience are the core foundations of our 
Bank. We are dedicated to developing sustainability practices and ensure we do our best to 
protect the environment and contribute to the welfare of all sections of the society.  Our 
unwavering dedication is to conduct our operations with a strong commitment to sustainable 
practices, integrating ESG considerations into our decision-making processes.  
 
By integrating Economic, Social and Governance (ESG) goals into its Vision Statement, the Bank 
is on the path of creating long term stakeholders value.  
 
The Bank’s Vision is to be the most innovative and responsive neighbourhood bank in India 
serving entrepreneurs, individuals, and businesses by adapting “best practices” while ensuring 
strong governance, good working atmosphere for employees and be responsible towards 
society and environment. 
 
The Bank’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is integral to its Vision of fostering sustainable 
development and societal progress. The Bank’s CSR strategy is mapped to UN Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs). We have started various initiatives across India in this regard. 
Collaborating with NGO’s / Partners like Concern India Foundation, iNaturewatch Foundation, 
Megh Pyne Abhiyan, Rotary Velachery Charitable Trust, SankalpTaru Foundation, Tieedi 
Permaculture Foundation, Under The Mango Tree Foundation, and Waste Warriors Foundation, 
the Bank has embarked on diverse CSR strategies aimed at fostering sustainable livelihoods, 
environmental conservation, and community development. 
 
One of the key CSR initiatives involves supporting sustainable livelihoods in coastal districts like 
Kendrapara in Odisha and Uttara Kannada in Karnataka. Through partnerships with Concern 
India Foundation, we’re promoting aquaculture farming and beekeeping, thereby empowering 
local communities while safeguarding coastal ecosystems. Additionally, efforts by iNaturewatch 
Foundation in Mumbai and Kalyan, Maharashtra, focus on restoring natural forest landscapes 
and creating biodiversity parks, contributing to ecosystem conservation and public awareness. 
Addressing sanitation challenges and disaster resilience, Megh Pyne Abhiyan's Phyademand 
Sauchalay project in West Champaran, Bihar, offers ecologically sustainable sanitation 
solutions. Meanwhile, Rotary Velachery Charitable Trust in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, emphasizes 
urban tree maintenance and Miyawaki plantation, enhancing green cover and biodiversity in 
urban landscapes. 
 
SankalpTaru Foundation's nationwide tree plantation initiatives further shows our commitment 
to environmental sustainability. Similarly, Tieedi Permaculture Foundation's Green Mile project 
in Darjeeling, West Bengal, focuses on solid waste management and material recovery, 
promoting environmental stewardship.

Moreover, Under The Mango Tree Foundation's 
endeavours in Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat aim to 
establish 
beekeeping 
practices 
for 
tribal 
communities, fostering sustainable livelihoods and 
biodiversity conservation. Lastly, Waste Warriors 
Foundation's zero-waste initiative in Tehri Garhwal, 
Uttarakhand, aligns with our dedication to 
environmental preservation and responsible waste 
management, particularly concerning the Ganga 
river. 
 
We have taken a commendable step towards eco-
friendly practices by using natural housekeeping 
products made by Ekam Eco Solutions Pvt. Ltd. Ekam 
is leading provider of sustainable solutions for environmental conservation. Their natural 
housekeeping products are made from eco-friendly ingredients, free from harmful chemicals 
and biodegradable, ensuring minimal impact on the environment. Our decision to use these 
products demonstrates our commitment to sustainability and environmental conservation.  
 
By digitising various processes in various units like Customer Service, Human Resources, 
Company Secretary etc, the Bank was able to save to approximately 160 tonnes of paper during 
last financial year. Moreover, the Bank has planted more than 1 lakh trees in FY 2024. 
 
Further, our CSR project for household biogas units in Adilabad, Telangana was awarded the 
runner-up at the CSR Journal Excellence Awards 2023. 
 
Overall, through the above- mentioned initiatives, the Bank not only addresses pressing socio-
environmental challenges but also fosters long-term sustainable development, demonstrating 
its commitment to corporate citizenship and societal well-being. 
 
Let us reaffirm our commitment to sustainability objectives, driven by the conviction that 
ethical business conduct not only strengthens the Bank but also paves the way for a more 
sustainable future for forthcoming generations. Together, we have the power to initiate lasting 
change and act as a guiding light for positive evolution within our industry. 
 
Finally, I extend sincere appreciation to all stakeholders who have stood by us on our 
sustainability voyage. Our clients, partners, employees, investors, and communities play a vital 
role in shaping our sustainability strategy, and we are truly grateful for your cooperation and 
support.

Digital 
Banking 
O 
Digital banking is essential due to its 
transformative potential for financial 
institutions. 
Digital 
banking 
offers 
opportunities to enhance operational 
efficiency, reduce costs, and improve 
customer experience. It opens avenues for 
innovation, 
allowing 
banks 
to 
stay 
competitive and meet evolving customer 
expectations. Moreover, the broader 
societal benefits, including increased 
accessibility, environmental conservation, 
and reduced carbon footprint, align with 
contemporary values and regulatory 
trends. Embracing digital banking presents 
a strategic opportunity for financial 
institutions to position themselves as tech-
savvy, customer-centric entities in a 
rapidly evolving financial landscape. 
 
We have invested in 
robust 
digital 
infrastructure that can 
handle 
increasing 
volumes 
of 
transactions securely. 
Implemented advance 
security protocols to 
safeguard 
against 
cyber threats such as 
malware, phishing and 
data breaches. This 
includes 
encryption, 
multi-factor 
authentication, 
real 
time monitoring and 
regular security audits. 
We are continuously 
improving the user 
interface 
and 
experience of digital 
banking platforms to 
make 
them 
user 
friendly, intuitive and 
accessible 
across 
devices.

Code of Conduct. Additionally, the policy incorporates provisions for safeguarding whistle 
blowers against victimization, ensuring their protection. It also facilitates direct communication

possible in branches and offices (possible with right of ownership to rooftop terrace is 
available)  
● 
Installed waterless urinals in large offices where water savings happen in large numbers. 
These systems do not use flushing water thereby saving water.  
● 
Use of products with highest energy efficiency such as inverter/VRF bases air 
conditioners, LED glow sign boards, LED down lighting, energy complaint UPS all these 
are aimed towards reduction of power consumption.  
● 
Use of smart practices such as master switch to cut off unwanted power consumption 
during non-working hours due to human mistakes. Use of occupancy based sensors for 
switching off of light during times of non-use.  
● 
Use of green certified products which are aimed at reduction of resources e.g. certified 
plumbing and sanitary products which help achieve lower consumption of water.  
● 
The Bank has undertaken digitalization of various processes/ activities during the year 
which has saved approximately 160 tonnes of paper.

PRINCIPLE 9 - Businesses should engage with and provide value to their consumers 
in a responsible manner  
 
The Bank has robust grievance and complaint policies in place to promptly address and resolve 
customer grievances/ concerns. These policies underscore our commitment to ensuring 
transparency, accountability, and customer satisfaction, aligning with our dedication to providing 
high-quality and responsive financial services. 
 
ESSENTIAL INDICATORS 
 
1. Describe the mechanisms in place to receive and respond to consumer complaints and feedback. 
 
The Bank’s Grievance Redressal mechanism is in line with the regulatory guidelines and is guided  
by the Board approved Grievance Redressal Policy. Customer complaints about a product/ service  
are dealt with courteously and promptly within a defined time-frame.  
 
The Bank diligently adheres to its commitment to Service Excellence through a structured approach 
based on six core pillars: Voice of Customer, Service Recovery, Attrition Calling, Process Simplification, 
Service Culture, and Measures and Metrics. This commitment is upheld through regular reviews 
conducted by the Service Excellence team in collaboration with key stakeholders. These reviews 
encompass various engagement strategies such as direct feedback collection from frontline staff, 
surprise unit visits, customer meetings, focus groups, and "mystery shopping" exercises to gauge 
frontline service standards. 
 
To ensure robust oversight and accountability, the Bank has established three distinct committees: 
Branch Level Customer Service Committees (BLCSCs), Standing Committee on Customer Service 
(SCCS), and Customer Service Committee of the Board (CSCB). Each committee operates at different 
organizational levels to monitor and address customer service concerns effectively. 
 
An autonomous "Service Excellence" team has been formed to meticulously analyse customer 
complaints, pinpoint root causes of service issues, implement process enhancements, and 
collaborate with diverse business units and functions to continually elevate service standards. The 
Bank maintains an "Integrated Centralized Complaint Management" system and adheres to 
stringent standards to ensure prompt resolution of customer queries and complaints. Regular 
monitoring of customer complaints and satisfaction levels is conducted by the Managing Director & 
Chief Executive Officer in conjunction with the Senior Management team, emphasizing the Bank's 
unwavering commitment to delivering exceptional service experiences. For more information, kindly
