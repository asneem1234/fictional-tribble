Annexure - 1
Solid Waste generation and management 
Fly Ash (CPP) : Generation of fly ash is basically from AFBC Boiler. Fly ash is removed from fluidized bed of the steam generator and 
hoppers of the steam generator bank, economizer, air pre-heater and ESP. In the existing setup, generation of fly ash is 26784 TPA.
Fly ash, collected is conveyed pneumatically through pipeline to fly ash silo. Electronic controls are installed to ensure leak proof transfer of 
fly ash from hoppers to fly ash silo. Bag house filter is also installed at fly ash silo to arrest fugitive emissions.
Fly ash is sent to cement plants and balance is used for in-house brick manufacturing. Care is taken to avoid any dust emission.  
Bed Ash (CPP) : Bed ash is generated from AFBC steam generator. The total quantity of bed ash generation is about 22320 TPA.
Quenching of the bed ash is carried out by spraying the cooling tower blow down water. Bed Ash is used for internal road and filling low lying 
areas in plant premises. 
ESP Dust & DRI Ash : ESP Dust & DRI Ash are generated at DRI Plant and used as fuel in the existing plant. DRI sludge is also used as fuel 
in FBC Boiler and also disposed by sale to local parties. DRI sludge will be generated from the scrubber installed at the DRI Plant. This 
sludge will be basically DRI Ash having good calorific value. 
The water treatment plant and effluent recycle plant provided in close loop of CCM, BSM & ASM has sludge drying beds for solar drying of 
solids separated at sludge drying beds. This is used in sinter plant for sinter manufacture.
In the existing setup, generation of ESP Dust & DRI Ash is 148400 TPA.
Bag Filter Dusts (DRI & SMS) : Dusts are collected from the bag filters installed in various sections mainly raw material handling in DRI and 
SMS/AOD. The quantity of bag filters dusts at full production capacity is 36750 TPA.
55
Dust collected at the bag filters of raw material handling sections of direct reduced iron plant is partly reused in the process of manufacturing 
sponge iron and balance for utilization in sinter plant for manufacturing sinter. The dust collected from the bag filters provided to EAF and 
LHF of the steel melting shop is 15750 TPA and is used in the sinter plant for manufacturing sinter. The dust collection from the bag filter 
provided to Stainless Steel Refining Converter of the steel melting shop is also used in the sinter plant for manufacturing sinter.
IF & EAF Slag : In existing setup, slag is generated from EAF. Total quantity of slag generation, at full production capacity is about 100200 
TPA and it is disposed by landfill within factory area. Slag is generated from Stainless Steel Refining Converter also and is used in the sinter 
plant for manufacturing sinter. 
After proposed expansion, slag will be generated from IF & EAF. Total quantity of slag generation, at full production capacity will be about 
195629 TPA. It will be disposed through sale to cement manufacturers and for roads construction and other end users. Slag will be 
generated from Stainless Steel Refining Converter also and it will be used same as in existing set up. 
Mill Scale (CCM & Rolling Mill) : Mill scale is generated at CCM, BSM and ASM Sections. The quantity of mill scale generated at full 
production capacity is about 10500 TPA. Water used for cooling purposes of billets and rolled steel products, carries mill scale along with it 
and admitted in scale pit under gravity. From the scale pit, mill scale is removed periodically. The total mill scale constitutes 2/3rd from CCM 
mill scale and about 1/3rd from BSM/ASM Mill Scale. These scales are used for sinter manufacture.
Iron/Steel Scrap/Rejected Billets (Rolling Mill) : Total generation of Iron/Steel Scrap/Rejected Billets from existing plant at full production 
capacity is 20000 TPA.
Iron/Steel Scrap 15000 TPA is generated during cutting of steel bars at BSM, ASM of Rolling Mill. Steel Scrap is also generated from Bright 
Bar Section and Coiler. Rejected Billets 5000 TPA from Rolling Mill are also generated at full production capacity. These solid wastes are 
recycled by melting in the steel manufacturing.
Grinder Waste (Rolling Mill) : It is generated during removal of upper layer of steel bars at Bright Bar Section. Total quantity of grinder 
waste generation is about 5000 TPA. This waste is recycled to SMS section for melting and reuse.
Coal Rejects/Fines (Coal Washery) : This waste is generated in the process of screening of crushed and wet coal at Coal Washery. The 
stone and shells of the coal are separated at screening. It is estimated 84000 TPA at full production capacity and are reused as fuel in power 
plant within the premises.
Granulated MBF Slag : Granulated MBF slag is taken from the bottom of MBF. The generation of MBF slag is 112500 TPA at full production 
capacity. This slag is partly used for making concrete roads within factory premises and balance is disposed by sale to cement plants.
Residue at MBF Gas Cleaning Plant: It is separated in thickner of Gas Cleaning Plant at MBF. The generation is 20000 TPA at full 
production capacity. This residue is used for sinter manufacture.
Coke Fines & Nuts (MBF Plant) : Coke fines are generated at MBF. The generation is 17500 TPA at full production capacity. Coke Fines are 
used in the sinter plant for manufacturing sinter.
Iron Ore Fines & Sinter (DRI & MBF Plant) : Iron Ore fines and Sinter are generated at DRI Plant & MBF. Total generation is 132900 TPA at 
full production capacity. Iron Ore Fines generation at DRI Plant is 27900 TPA and at MBF Iron Ore Fines and Sinter generation is 10500 TPA 
at full production capacity. Iron Ore Fines are used in the sinter plant for manufacturing sinter. 
Hot Returned Ore (Sinter Plant) : Hot returned ore is generated in Sinter plant 85000 TPA at full production capacity. Hot returned Ore is 
recycled in sinter plant.
Removed dust (Sinter Plant) : Removed dust is generated in Sinter plant 12500 TPA at full production capacity. Removed dust is recycled 
in sinter plant.
All stock piles and waste are and will be laid on top of a stable liner to avoid leaching of materials to ground water. Some plants of 
Brassicaceae family will be planted near raw material storage yard, ash disposal site as well as around the project area as a precautionary 
measure of phytoremediation.
4.7.2 
Hazardous Waste
Used/Spent Oil (Schedule–1, Category No. 5.1): Lubrication and other oils used in machineries loose their properties after use for some 
days. Used oils removed from machineries, gear boxes, compressors etc are collected in drums and the well-packed drums are temporarily 
stored in specifically earmarked area within the premises. 
These oils will be used in furnaces/Boilers and also for anti-rust coating of rolled steel products and also sold to authorized reprocessors 
/recyclers. 
Acid Residue, Spent Bath Sludge and ETP Chemical Sludge (Category No. 12.1, 12.2 & 35.3): Spent acid, acid residue and spent bath 
sludge generated at Bright Bar Section and Coinage Plant is transported to CETP (Common Effluent Treatment Plant) for treatment. 
Similarly spent acid, acid residue, spent bath sludge and rinsing water generated at Centralized Pickling Plant is drained to CETP for the 
treatment.
In CETP, neutralization is carried out and after flocculation, suspended solids are separated out at clarifier & gravity sand filters. Suspended 
solids in the form of dried sludge separated at gravity sand filters is termed as CETP Chemical Sludge.
At CPP, regeneration of DM Plant is carried out periodically using acid and sodium hydroxide. Effluent of DM Plant is very small and after 
neutralization in underground pit, the overflow of the pit is mixed with other treated effluents for disposal. Underground Pit of the DM Plant 
section is cleaned once in six months and solids are solar dried at CETP. These solids are termed as CETP chemical Sludge.
