The uncertainty about 
the 
timing 
and 
severity of climate

the 
financial system.

as 
it 
enables 
organizations

risks, and hindered 
potential for business 
success.

In response to all the specific commitment goals set by the Company 
in FY 2023 -24 with respect to ESG, the performance for the same is 
mentioned below: 
 
• Financing for green activities / projects by way of green deposits 
pursuant to regulatory directions – As part of this initiative, the 
bank consistently strives to be environmentally friendly by 
directing its lending towards agriculture and MSMEs as part of its 
regular business operations in compliance with regulatory 
directions. 
 
• Installation of energy efficient equipments across all its branches 
to reduce environment impacts and lower the operational costs 
and adopting renewable energy sources like solar at its various 
offices subject to feasibility - Despite the addition of 48 new 
branches in the Financial Year and facing increased electricity 
tariffs in many states across India, energy consumption for the 
entire financial year rose by only 16% compared to the previous 
year. Persistent directives were issued to all branches and offices, 
emphasizing the importance of efficient electricity usage and 
environmental awareness. 
 
• Prohibit the usage or disposal of plastics in the bank's premises 
by all Means - The bank has minimized the use of plastic bottles, 
plates, cups, and spoons in Board and Committee meetings. Only 
sustainable products are used to serve food, water, and 
refreshments.  
 
• Implementation of Bring Your Bottle ("BYB") concept amongst all 
employees to discourage the usage of packaged drinking water 
bottles - The Bank had sensitized all its employees to prohibit the 
use of plastics in the Banks premises, bringing own water bottles 
for drinking water purpose instead of using disposable pet 
bottles, minimise paper consumption, use of energy efficient 
equipment’s and conservation of water resources by optimum 
usage of water.  
At the head office level, the employees and customers of the 
Bank are also made aware of the above by way of sign boards at 
prominent places in the banks premises. 
 
• 
Digitalise the lending process and minimise paper consumption 
to a greater extent - the Bank has partnered with a new vendor 
to enable advanced features for e-Board Meetings through an 
application, and the implementation is underway. This initiative 
aims to further decrease the paperwork associated with 
conducting meetings. 
 
During the FY 2023, the Bank partnered with the vendor 
'NewGen' to digitize its retail and MSME portfolios. As of July 
2023, lending under the retail segment has been implemented, 
and MSME lending went live from October 2023. Additionally, to 
enhance the digital lending process, the Bank collaborated with 
Boston Consulting Group during the reporting year. This 
partnership is actively transforming the Bank's lending processes 
in coordination with the NewGen team. 
 
Governance, leadership and oversight 
7. Statement by director 
responsible 
for 
the 
business responsibility 
report, highlighting ESG 
related 
challenges, 
targets 
and 
achievements  
As the Director overseeing business responsibility, I am pleased to 
highlight our significant strides in addressing Environmental, Social, 
and Governance (ESG) challenges. Our commitment to sustainability 
has enhanced our positive impact on the environment, stakeholders, 
and the communities we serve. We have made substantial progress in 
reducing our carbon footprint and engaging in local community 
initiatives. 
 
Specifically, we have invested in Environmental and Water 
conservation projects including the restoration of water bodies in 
Tamilnadu, cleaning / desiltation of tanks in various districts of 
Tamilnadu for the benefit of local community, contribution to various 
Municipalities under Self Sufficiency Scheme [SSS] of the Govt. etc. 
These efforts have increased groundwater levels, benefiting local 
farmers and promoting sustainable development. Further, to reduce 
our environmental impact, during the reporting year we have 
implemented paperless banking, the details of which are given in a 
separate para on Digital Banking in the beginning of the Annual 
Report. 
 
On the Social front, we contribute significantly to community 
development by supporting Health care projects, facilitating quality 
Education in schools and colleges by providing infrastructure & 
technology support and conduct Financial Inclusion programs.  
 
We prioritize employee development by offering them training 
programs at various reputed institutions like IIM, NIBM, SIBSTC etc. 
apart from in-house training at Staff colleges of the Bank to enhance 
their skills to foster their professional and personal growth. During the 
financial year 2023-24, 5,662 employees were imparted training 
which comprises to 79% of the total employee strength of the Bank.  
 
On the governance front, the Bank’s Internal Control Systems, policies 
and procedures focuses on maintaining compliance with laws 
applicable to the Bank in letter and spirit. The Bank is transparent in 
its functioning and makes relevant disclosures to the Investor 
Community as per various Regulatory / Statutory requirements. Also, 
the Board of the Bank consists of persons with diverse expertise 
providing a strong sense of leadership and governance in facilitating 
crucial decisions and setting strategies. Further, majority of the Board 
consists of Independent Directors. A detailed information on the 
governance aspects of the Bank is provided separately in the Annual 
Report.   
 
Our dedication to ESG principles remains integral to our business 
strategy, aiming to create enduring value for stakeholders and 
contribute to a sustainable future.

the 
waste 
management 
practices adopted in your establishments. 
Describe the strategy adopted by your company 
to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic 
chemicals in your products and processes and 
the practices adopted to manage such wastes. 
Given that the Bank is solely engaged in financial 
services, it does not partake in any manufacturing 
processes. 
However, 
the 
Bank 
upholds 
sustainable waste management practices to 
ensure proper disposal of generated waste. 
 
a) E-waste, Plastic and Battery waste - The Bank 
facilitates the transportation of plastic waste to 
local vendors for processing and disposal. 
Ensuring the proper handling of E-Waste is crucial, 
both for security purposes and environmental 
considerations. Consequently, computers and 
associated accessories are delivered to vendors or 
certified disposal agencies. To track the quantity 
of battery waste collected, disposed of, and 
recycled, the Bank has implemented a reporting 
and monitoring system 
 
b) Hazardous Waste - As a Banking Company, our 
operations do not involve the use of hazardous or 
toxic chemicals, and as a result, we do not 
generate any such waste. 
 
c) Other waste - Given the nature of the Bank's 
business, other forms of waste are not applicable.

Administrative Office. 
 
• Follow-up and Resolution: The Inspection Department ensures timely resolution and closure of 
complaints by coordinating with branches and departments. 
 
• Additional Channels: Customers can register complaints through the Bank's Call Centre, 
Customer Care number, or online grievance redressal page on the Bank's website. 
 
• Feedback Mechanism: Periodic customer service committee meetings gather direct feedback 
and suggestions for improving services and products, implemented through actionable 
suggestions. 
 
• Designated Officers: The Bank appoints a Principal Nodal Officer for Grievances, a Nodal Officer 
for Complaints, and an Internal Ombudsman under the Banking Ombudsman Scheme to oversee 
complaint resolution and customer satisfaction. 
 
This structured approach ensures efficient handling and resolution of customer complaints in line
