adapt or mitigate the risk along with its financial implications, as per the following format:

Financial implications of 
the risk or opportunity 
(Indicate positive or 
negative implications)
1
Health risks 
associated 
with the 
workplace 
affecting 
employees
 R
Workplace health risks 
can lead to increased 
employee absenteeism, 
reduced productivity, and 
lower morale. By gathering 
samples from patients with 
infectious diseases shows 
significant risk related to 
health. Failure to address 
these risks adequately may 
lead to regulatory non-
compliance, resulting in 
fines and penalties. The 
cumulative effect of these 
factors can significantly 
impact the company’s 
bottom line and long-term 
sustainability.
The Company has 
implemented measures to 
safeguard the well-being of 
its staff. Regular vaccinations 
are administered in line 
with guidelines. Medical 
insurance is provided to 
reduce health and financial 
risks for employees. Financial 
assistance is offered to the 
families of staff members 
who have lost their lives while 
treating patients. The company 
also rotates staff involved in 
sample collection
Negative Implications:
These issues can result 
in higher operational 
costs, decreased output, 
and potential loss of 
skilled workers, which 
could lower the quality 
of patient care and raise 
hiring costs. Additionally, 
health-related incidents 
may lead to legal 
liabilities, compensation 
claims, and damage 
to the company’s 
reputation, potentially 
affecting its ability to 
attract and retain talent. 
2
Workplace 
Protection
R
Poorly implemented 
safety measures can lead 
to workplace accidents, 
resulting in negative effects 
like higher absenteeism and 
an increased Lost Time Rate 
(LTR).
The Company has put in 
place a comprehensive 
safety manual that provides 
guidelines for all labs within 
the company. Regular health 
check-ups are carried out, 
especially for employees 
in technical to proactively 
monitor their well-being.
• 	 Staff are provided 
with necessary safety 
equipment, including eye 
wash stations, gloves, 
lab coats, goggles, fire 
sprinklers, TLD badges and 
fire extinguishers.
•	
Periodic fire drills are 
conducted to ensure 
employees are familiar 
with evacuation 
procedures and 
understand their roles 
during emergencies.
•	
The organization follows 
the Biomedical Waste 
Management (BMW) rules 
established by the Central 
Pollution Control Board 
(CPCB) guidelines.
•	
Strict disinfection protocols 
are implemented in the 
centers to maintain a 
clean and hygienic working 
environment.
Negative Implications:
Lost Time due to 
workplace accidents 
or injuries can create 
additional challenges 
for a centers, such as 
the necessity to pay 
overtime to complete 
work.
O
Effective workplace 
protection measures can 
lead to improved employee 
safety, health, and well-
being. This can result in 
increased productivity, 
higher job satisfaction, and 
lower turnover rates.
Positive Implications:
The Company can 
enhance employee 
safety and well-being, 
improved morale, and 
a stronger corporate 
reputation. This can 
result in a competitive 
advantage in attracting 
and retaining talent, as 
well as potential cost 
savings through reduced 
incidents and improved 
operational efficiency.

Risk  
Management
R
Poor risk management 
can leave the company 
vulnerable to various 
threats, potentially leading 
to significant financial losses, 
operational disruptions, 
and damage to reputation. 
It may result in missed 
opportunities due to an 
overly cautious approach 
or unexpected crises due to 
overlooked risks. Inadequate 
risk management can also 
lead to non-compliance with 
regulations, resulting in fines 
and legal issues.
The company collaborates 
with key stakeholders in the 
risk management process to 
ensure that all relevant parties 
are informed about potential 
risks and committed to 
creating strategies to address 
them.
By involving stakeholders in 
this process, the company 
promotes a culture of risk 
awareness and accountability, 
resulting in more successful 
outcomes in risk management.
Negative Implications:
The main risk lies in 
inadequate or ineffective 
risk management 
practices, which can 
leave the organization 
vulnerable to various 
threats and potential 
losses.
 O
Effective risk management 
can lead to better 
decision-making, improved 
operational efficiency, and 
enhanced ability to capitalize 
on opportunities. It can help 
the company anticipate and 
mitigate potential threats, 
reducing the likelihood and 
impact of adverse events.
Positive Implications:
By proactively aligning 
important issues with 
risk mitigation strategies, 
the company can 
develop a more resilient 
and sustainable growth 
approach.
4
Waste  
Management
 R
Ineffective waste 
management can lead to 
environmental pollution, 
potentially resulting in 
regulatory fines, legal 
liabilities, and reputational 
damage for examples 
production of biomedical 
waste as a result of the 
business activities. 
 
Disposal is carried out by 
a government-authorized 
partner, with waste sorted 
into different color-coded 
bags that have barcodes. The 
waste is weighed before being 
transferred to an authorized 
vendor. All safety regulations 
are adhered to from the point 
of generation until it is handed 
over to the authority.
Negative Implications:
Improper disposal could 
result in the spread of 
diseases and negatively 
impact the company’s 
social license to operate. 
If not disposed of 
properly, it could lead to 
the spread of diseases 
and affect the social 
license to operate. It may 
also lead to inefficient 
use of resources, 
increasing operational 
costs and reducing 
profitability.
