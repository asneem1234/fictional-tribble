It’s human nature 
to stretch, to go, to 
see, to understand. 
Exploration is not a 
choice, really; it’s an 
imperative”
Neil Armstrong,

expertise and innovative offerings have

strategic decisions, but also powered

the human gazing at the stars through 
a telescope is symbolic of the ability 
of our employees to navigate the 
complexities of an intricately woven 
global financial world with precision, 
foresight and patience.
Just as the telescope brings distant 
celestial bodies within our view, our 
analytical acumen ensures that solving 
any mission-critical challenge – no 
matter how complex – is achievable.
The clear sky, which allows us to 
see the stars, signifies CRISIL’s 
clarity of vision and purpose

infinite, our future opportunities in

value to our clients.

Message from the Chairman
CRISIL’s foundational 
capabilities position 
us well to unleash our 
limitless potential 
and become a partner 
of choice for global 
enterprises seeking 
growth.
Dear Shareholders,
It is my privilege to write to you for the first time 
as CRISIL’s Chairman and share your Company’s 
performance in 2023.
Your Company demonstrated resilience and 
created significant impact through its work and 
sustainability efforts, in line with our strategy and 
our mission of making markets function better.
Together, the trinity of integrity, insight and impact 
give us a winning edge in the market.
The global macroeconomic situation remained 
complex in 2023. World growth was higher 
than expected and inflation, despite peaking, 
was above target for many central banks. India 
showed resilience and emerged as the world’s 
fastest‑growing major economy.
As a global analytics company, we continue to be a 
trusted partner for all our stakeholders – clients, 
investors, employees, and the community at 
large – driven by professional integrity, analytical 
excellence, and domain knowledge. Our net promoter 
score continues to be strong owing to our focus on 
customer centricity.
CRISIL Ratings maintained its market leading 
position in corporate bond ratings, driven by investor 
preference for our best-in-class ratings.
Our Global Analytical Centre (GAC) celebrated 20 
years of partnership with S&P Global Ratings.
The Market Intelligence and Analytics (MI&A) division 
gained momentum in credit risk solutions, and 
research and consulting services.
Both our global divisions witnessed growth amidst 
pressure on discretionary spends by financial 
services clients. Global Research & Risk Solutions 
(GR&RS) division saw traction in lending and buy-
side segment, while Global Benchmarking Analytics 
(GBA) saw momentum in corporate and investment 
banking (CIB), driven by emphasis on client 
engagement and product innovation.

Your Company has set up a delivery center 
in Colombia to enhance our ability to service 
our North American clients, and significantly 
augment our global delivery model.
CRISIL was named among the world’s top 50 
organisations in the Chartis RiskTech100® 2024 
list in the Model Validation category for the 
second consecutive year.
We made two acquisitions in 2023 to expand 
our presence in Australia and New Zealand, and 
sustainability services.
Franchise activities continued to elevate our 
brand visibility, including flagship events like 
Annual Infrastructure Conclave, which took 
place after a gap of three years and Competitive 
Challenges Conference for asset managers 
in Boston.
On the technology front, your Company 
completed cloud migration and continued to 
explore the exciting prospects offered by GenAI to 
drive growth and efficiency.
People are our biggest asset and most important 
IP.  Your Company takes immense pride in its 
people-first culture, of which diversity, equity and 
inclusion form the bedrock – as underscored by 
a global workforce comprising 39% women and 
over 40 nationalities.
We continue to invest in talent to make them 
future-ready and encourage the workforce to 
think entrepreneurially.
Your Company received three prestigious 
accolades in 2023: the Great Place To Work™ 
certification for the fourth time in a row, the 100 
Best Companies for Women in India, and ‘bronze’ 
category employer recognition by the India 
Workplace Equality Index.
My sincere thanks to our talented employees around 
the world for their dedication and impact delivered 
in 2023.
Our efforts in shaping the agenda for sustainability 
gathered momentum in 2023 through our work in the 
environmental, social and governance (ESG) space. 
CRISIL Foundation continued to create a lasting impact 
through promotion of financial literacy for women and 
conservation of the environment.
In 2024, the expected soft landing of the global 
economy could have a bearing on discretionary spends 
by global clients.
CRISIL’s foundational capabilities position us well to 
unleash our limitless potential and become a partner of 
choice for global enterprises seeking growth.
I am excited by the possibilities ahead of us. We remain 
committed to delivering value to all our stakeholders 
through investments in technology, talent and 
new solutions.
I look forward to your continued support.
Best,
Yann Le Pallec

Time to usher in Next-gen Credit Monitoring set-up
The credit monitoring infrastructure of banks has not kept 
pace with the tightening regulatory requirements. The 
report highlights the emphasis across banks to evolve from 
a traditional passive monitoring approach to a modern 
dynamic credit risk monitoring set-up, characterised by a 
robust early warning system.
Key Highlights
There is an underlined shift towards a systematic data-
driven approach incorporating:
	 forward-looking data
	 reduction in false positives
Integrating with credit risk workflow

Understanding Fixed-Income Markets, 2023
Key Highlights
	 The transition and preparation paved the way for 
2023 to be a year of regulatory implementation and 
acceptance that current market conditions are the 
new baseline
	 Some aspects are commendable: clear regulations 
for crypto market oversight, ongoing attention to 
the requirements of retail traders, and fixed-income 
investments delivering practical yields
	 However, some areas are concerning: the persistent 
pursuit of identifying the next tail risk, the impending 
threat of a global recession, and the aftermath of last 
year’s asset devaluations
Understanding why fixed-income markets exist, how they have 
evolved, and how these markets operate today, is crucial to 
ensure they remain robust and effective.
Key Highlights
	 This research examines the core segments of fixed-
income markets with a focus on bond markets, market 
size, participants and mechanisms in place to invest in 
and trade these products
The past year has been one of both transition 
and preparation. Transition away from a 
decades long low-rate environment, equity bull 
market and COVID lockdowns.
Preparation for market structure changes on 
the back of the March 2020 liquidity crunch 
and meme stock craze, in the form of regulatory 
proposals and the comment letters both for 
and against that have quickly followed.

Our first 
Sakhi-turned-Sarpanch 
in Rajasthan
I am the first Sakhi from Rajasthan who 
contested and won the local Panchayat 
elections, way back in 2019. My views are 
being sought by the Sarpanch (village head) 
– especially while accessing banking and 
welfare entitlements for the village.
But that was not all. I have now learned how 
to facilitate digital payments. Now, I can 
recharge my phone, send small amounts of 
fund transfers, pay LIC installments, and 
even book online gas and recharge my DTH. 
I have also helped the community to use 
these facilities.
Being a Sakhi has transformed my life, and I 
am grateful to Mein Pragati for having built 
my confidence and stature in my village.

50,000 villages in 14 states 
and 4 Union Territories.
Enabling Social Impact
Key CSR Initiatives in 2023
Mein Pragati and CRISIL RE
CRISIL’s two flagship CSR programmes focussed 
on building financial capabilities and enabling 
environmental conservation, respectively.
Mein Pragati
‘Mein Pragati’ is the flagship financial capability-building 
initiative of CRISIL Foundation. During the year, the initiative 
expanded organically into new blocks and villages of 
Assam and Rajasthan. Through this initiative, our Sakhis 
(women community cadre):
•	 Actively spread community awareness
•	 Facilitate easy access to banking and other financial and 
social security schemes
CRISIL Foundation’s effort through Mein Pragati has led to a larger partnership—implementation of the MoneyWise 
Centre for Financial Literacy (CFL) project in India with support from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), 11 public 
sector banks and NABARD. Under this intiative, satellite offices have been set up in remote, far-flung areas to 
catalyse and facilitate last-mile financial literacy and inclusion. 
Over 5,200+ 
Sakhis
Across 113 blocks 
and 30 districts
Present in 
5,000+ villages
In 2 states
Knowledge is Power
“I was married off at a young age. After marriage, I used to assist my husband 
in his paddy fields. My life changed after I met Rinku Deka, a Sakhi in my 
village. She educated me on the various government schemes and bank 
services available to me. Rinku also underscored the importance of having an 
Aadhaar Card and PAN Card to be eligible for these schemes.
Today, I have a Ration Card, Health Insurance Card and an Ayushman Card. 
I independently travel to the bank and post office to carry out my financial 
transactions. What adds to my happiness is that I am also able to guide my 
husband and the entire family on financial matters.”

Livelihoods in Assam
The initiatives covered Eri silk rearing, handlooms 
and loom upgradation, and agro-hub farming 
in three districts of Assam - Kamrup, Nalbari 
and Goalpara. During the year, the programme 
enhanced household coverage and improved income 
generation for over 2,000 households.
Livelihoods in Rajasthan
A pilot project on Livelihoods was initiated in 
Rajasthan to support 35 unskilled rural women 
learn rug-making and establish market linkage. The 
project enabled weavers to enhance their household 
incomes. During the year, the initiative was expanded 
to 106+ weavers in two villages of Rajasthan.
Towards a better future
“I am an artisan entrepreneur hailing from 
the remote village of Ladugiri in Kamrup, 
Assam. I joined CRISIL Foundation’s 
Handloom initiative, under which I 
received rigorous training in design, 
natural dyeing and business skills in my 
native language. With their steadfast 
support, I have slowly transformed my 
bamboo shaft loom into a structured 
frame loom, over the past few years. 
The product range has expanded from 
traditional Assam items to sarees, stoles, 
fabrics and more.
I often showcase my creations at various 
exhibitions and have been winning orders 
from national and international buyers. 
This has resulted in a 40% increase in 
my household income. Supported by my 
family and a newfound infrastructure, I 
now look forward to a promising future.”

Launched a series of high-profile outreach initiatives 
during the year that were extensively covered by the media 
and well appreciated by stakeholders
The ratings industry sustained its growth momentum in 2023, 
backed by (i) increase in on-year bond market issuances, 
albeit which turned somewhat sluggish during the second 
half and (ii) a steady growth in bank credit.
With easing bond yields and inflation, corporate bond 
issuances surged over 90% on-year in the first half of the year, 
supporting growth in the bond rating segment. Growth in the 
first half was also supported by a large one-time issuance 
from a leading housing finance company, before its merger 
with a bank. However, the second half saw a decline in bond 
issuances with increasing geopolitical uncertainties and the 
consequent hardening of bond yields. Overall, 2023 still saw a 
healthy over 25% on-year growth in the rated bond quantum.
Further, bank credit grew 15.6% in 2023. The retail credit 
at 17.7% and services credit growth (including credit to 
financial services sector) at 19.6%, supported growth of the 
BLR segment. However, credit growth to large corporates 
(at 6.5%) tapered, especially in the second half of the year. 
Reflecting the credit growth, the new and enhanced BLR 
quantum across credit rating agencies (CRAs) saw an on-year 
increase of over 25% in 2023. The number of companies with

new BLRs also rose, albeit at relatively modest pace of 6%, 
across the industry.
The securitisation volume picked up in 2023 as compared to 
the previous year with rise in investor appetite backed by the 
continuing normalisation of collections – which had suffered 
due to Covid-19 related disruptions – for non-banking 
financial companies across different asset classes.
Other segments, such as ratings for security receipts, saw a 
pick-up in growth momentum, driven by the expanding assets 
under management of asset reconstruction companies; 
similarly, demand for the monitoring agency offering surged 
with increase in the number of companies raising equity from 
the primary market in 2023.
In this backdrop, CRISIL Ratings logged a healthy revenue 
growth of 17% on-year in 2023.
Amid an evolving macroeconomic environment, CRISIL 
Ratings continues to strengthen its leading position in the 
corporate bond market, driven by investors’ preference for 
best-in-class ratings.
Despite greater competitive intensity in the BLR market, 
CRISIL Ratings was able to sustain its market share in terms 
of new rated companies during the year. We witnessed 
increasing preference by Indian banks for CRAs, focused 
on quality of ratings, for loan exposures of their borrowers. 
CRISIL Ratings published more than 1,200 new BLRs in 2023.
On the analytical front, we continued to demonstrate strong 
quality with solid performance of ratings as reflected in 
the globally tracked metrics such as default rates and 
stability rates. We continued to strengthen our early 
warning mechanism through the Corporate Credit Health 
Framework. We proactively identified sectors which are 
impacted by macroeconomic developments and prioritising 
of rating reviews across vulnerable sectors and companies. 
These initiatives have helped CRISIL Ratings to maintain 
its high quality of ratings. The year 2023 saw an overhang 
of geopolitical and macro uncertainties presented credit 
challenges. The consequent decline in the global economic 
growth rate also presented credit challenges in 2023. 
Domestically, we saw borrowing costs rise for India Inc, even 
as domestic-focused businesses continued to perform well, 
especially compared to export-focused ones. Deleveraged 
balance sheets also supported credit profiles.
A key development in the regulatory space was SEBI 
publishing an operational or master circular in 2023, primarily 
consolidating its past circulars for CRAs and restricting the 
scope of regulations on listed securities.
On the franchise dimension, CRISIL Ratings continued to drive 
thought leadership in the industry by providing cutting-edge 
insights, hosting web conferences on new age and trending 
topics and engaging with industry leaders through panel 
discussions. Our opinion pieces received extensive coverage 
from premier print and digital media.
We conducted our first edition of ‘Infrastructure Summit—
Revving Roads and Renewables’ to further deepen our 
engagement with key stakeholders of these sectors. We also 
hosted our annual flagship seminar on the NBFC sector under 
the theme—‘NBFCs: Growth back in the limelight’. Both the 
events included presentations by experts from CRISIL Ratings 
and panel discussions involving several industry leaders, who 
shared their insights and perspectives.
In order to deepen our engagement with the existing as well 
as prospective clients located in Tier 2 regions, we hosted 
Ratings Regional Conclaves, to present our views on relevant 
industry trends and have close discussions with clients. This 
outreach activity witnessed encouraging responses from 
clients, investors and bankers.
Other well-received franchise activities during the year 
included webinars on renewables energy, infrastructure 
investment trusts / real estate investment trusts, roads, 
cement, steel, natural gas, speciality chemicals, power, and 
real estate.
Global Analytical Center (GAC) continued to drive surveillance 
support across the analytical practices of S&P Ratings, and 
partnered on data and technology transformation programs.

Human Resources
Diversity, equity and inclusion
CRISIL is committed to building an enabling environment that 
values the contributions of its employees and provides them 
opportunities to grow.
In this context, CRISIL has been committed to its diversity, 
equity and inclusion (DEI) agenda since its inception. We have 
expanded our knowledge and practices to create an equitable 
and inclusive workplace for all our employees.
We used the recommendations of the DEI taskforce from last 
year to enhance inclusion at CRISIL. One such key initiative 
that led to employees knowing their colleagues better 
was Eskalera. It is an online learning platform designed to 
cultivate a more productive and inclusive work culture through 
upskilling, human connection and actionable data, and is 
available for all on-roll employees. It sensitises all learners 
on aspects of self-identity, vulnerability, impact of exclusion, 
inclusion and psychological safety. Targeted modules for 
people managers are also available.
We continued to focus on leadership development of diverse 
groups, incorporating inclusion as a key theme in our flagship 
development programmes. We also participated in external 
programmes to bring in an outside-in perspective, particularly 
in the context of building a leadership pipeline, understanding 
global best practices and providing best-in-class 
development opportunities to our people. Initiatives related 
to speed mentoring, workshops on enhancing intercultural 
competency and celebration of events related to various 
dimensions of diversity, were implemented with a significant 
impact. Encouraged by CRISIL’s DEI efforts, especially those 
aimed at fostering a sense of allyship towards the LGBTQIA+ 
community, a few employees openly embraced their authentic 
selves with respect to their sexual orientation.
Our metrics on representation, hiring, growth and retention of 
diverse groups continued to improve this year. We recognised 
the importance of accessibility, sensitisation and leadership 
commitment in this journey, and formulated a DEI strategy to 
align with CRISIL’s future growth plans and talent agenda. DEI

awareness) and existing employees (as refresher modules).
Additionally, a buddy programme for new mothers was 
formalised this year.
Learning and Development
As we seek to grow in the future, we recognise that our people 
are our key differentiator, and we continue to invest in their 
professional development.
Various interventions across target groups were launched 
through the year. At the leadership level, our marquee 
programme, Leadership Excellence and Accelerated 
Development, concluded for the first batch of employees. The 
programme has recently been launched for the second batch.
One of the key focus areas this year was people manager 
enablement, with the objective of equipping them with 
leadership skills such as self-awareness, strategic thinking, 
team development and productivity improvement. In addition, 
digital learning platforms were made available to employees 
on a demand basis for self-paced learning. Further, specific 
learning programmes were curated and delivered based 
on business requirements. We also launched the CRISIL 
Essential Tech chapter this year, as well as self-paced 
courses of Essential Tech. Some cutting-edge technology 
offerings have been made available to employees. All the 
above initiatives enable learning and development to enhance 
operational efficiency and future readiness.
Talent Management and Succession Planning
Being a people-centric organisation, leadership development 
and succession planning are key strategic areas for 
the Company. As such, there is a strong focus on talent 
management and succession planning to create a robust 
talent pipeline for CXOs, their direct and skip-level reports, 
and other critical roles.
Our talent reviews include an exhaustive exercise of identifying 
high-potential employees, successors for key positions and 
working on leadership development for key talent.
The entire senior leadership team, along with our Managing 
Director and CEO, is involved in talent reviews, in close 
partnership with HR.
This not only helps develop leaders internally, but also opens 
up wider career opportunities, facilitates role changes, and 
enhances engagement and retention.
Directors
Members of the Company’s Board of Directors are eminent 
persons of proven competence and integrity. Besides global 
experience, strong financial acumen, strategic astuteness 
and leadership qualities, they have a significant degree of 
commitment to the Company. They devote adequate time to 
meetings and preparation. In terms of requirement of Listing 
Regulations, 2015, the Board has identified core skills, 
expertise and competencies of the Directors in the context 
of the Company’s business for effective functioning and how 
the current Board of Directors is fulfilling the required skills 
and competences. This is detailed at length in the Corporate 
Governance Report.
The Board meets at regular intervals to discuss and decide on 
the Company/ business policy and strategy, apart from other 
Board businesses. The Board exhibits strong operational 
oversight with regular business presentations at meetings. An 
annual planner of topics to be discussed at the Board meeting 
is pre-approved by the Directors. The Board/ Committee 
meetings are pre-scheduled and an annual calendar of 
the meetings is circulated to the Directors well in advance 
to help them plan their schedules and ensure meaningful 
participation. Only in the case of special and urgent business, 
should the need arise, is the Board’s approval taken by 
passing resolutions through circulation, as permitted by the 
law, which are confirmed in the subsequent Board meeting. 
The Company has complied with Secretarial Standards 
issued by the Institute of Company Secretaries of India on 
Board meetings and Annual General Meetings.
The agenda for the Board and Committee meetings includes 
detailed notes on the items to be discussed to enable 
the Directors to make informed decisions. The Company 
follows a two-day schedule for its quarterly Committee and 
Board meetings, which offers greater discussion time for 
Board matters.
In 2023, the Board met five times — on February 16, April 
18, July 17, September 12 and November 7. The maximum 
interval between two meetings did not exceed 120 days.
The Company’s Nomination and Remuneration Policy 
formulated under Section 178(3) of the Companies Act, 
2013, covers roles, responsibilities, criteria and procedures 
towards key aspects of Board governance, including the size 
and composition of the Board, criteria for directorship, terms 
and removal, succession planning, evaluation framework, and 
ongoing training and education of Board members. The Policy 
lays down detailed guidelines for remuneration of the Board, 
Managing Director and employees, and covers fixed and

Annual evaluation by the Board
During the year, the Board carried out an annual evaluation of 
its performance as well as of the working of its Committees and 
individual Directors, including the Chairman of the Board. This 
exercise was carried out through a structured questionnaire 
prepared separately for the Board, Committees, Chairman 
and individual Directors. The Chairman’s performance 
evaluation was carried out by Independent Directors at a 
separate meeting.
The parameters assessed included various aspects of the 
Board’s functioning, such as effectiveness, information flow 
between Board members and the Management, quality and 
transparency of Board discussions, Board dynamics, Board 
composition and understanding of roles and responsibilities, 
succession and evaluation, and possession of required 
experience and expertise by Board members, among 
other matters.
The performance of the Committees was evaluated 
on the basis of their effectiveness in carrying out their 
respective mandates.
Peer assessment of Directors, based on parameters such 
as participation in and contribution to Board deliberations, 
keeping oneself abreast of organisational matters, trends, 
knowledge and understanding of relevant areas, among other 
matters, was reviewed by the Board for individual feedback.
During 2023, the Company actioned feedback emerging from 
the Board evaluation process conducted in 2022, relating to 
operational improvements of the meeting process, matters of 
talent strategy and stakeholder interaction.
Compliance monitoring framework

Compliance reviews take place at multiple levels, as follows:
	•
First line of defence: Business and corporate functions 
ensure implementation of laws at the primary level through 
checks and controls in their operational processes
	•
Compliance Reporting tool: Compliances are further 
mapped into the Compliance Reporting tool and affirmed 
at regular frequencies by compliance owners, to generate 
Compliance Reports, which are submitted to the Board on 
a quarterly basis
	•
The compliance monitoring framework is periodically 
subject to audits by internal auditors as per the internal 
audit plan
	•
The Stakeholders’ Relationship Committee of the Company 
reviews instances of policy violations and breaches on a 
quarterly basis
Risk Management Policy and internal control 
adequacy
The Board has adopted policies and procedures for governance 
and for orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including 
adherence to the Company’s policies, safeguard of its assets, 
prevention and detection of frauds and errors, accuracy and 
completeness of accounting records, and timely preparation 
of reliable financial disclosures. The Company’s internal 
control systems are commensurate with the nature of its 
business and the size and complexity of its operations.
Significant audit observations and follow-up actions 
thereon are reported to the Audit Committee. For ensuring 
independence of the audits, internal auditors report directly 
to the Audit Committee. Both internal and statutory auditors 
have exclusive executive sessions with the Audit Committee 
periodically. In addition, during the year, management 
performed a review of key controls impacting financial 
reporting, at entity as well as operating levels, and submitted 
its report to the Audit Committee and the Board.
Risk assessments are conducted periodically, and the 
Company has a mechanism to identify, assess, mitigate and 
monitor various risks to key business objectives. Mitigation

are implemented and reviewed periodically. CRISIL has a 
balanced approach to risk management, mitigating risks to 
an acceptable level to protect our reputation and brand, while 
supporting the achievement of operational and strategic 
goals and objectives.
In addition to key strategic and operational risks, data 
security, cyber security, disruption from emerging 
technologies and people risk were primary focus areas 
during 2023. The challenging macroeconomic environment 
and volatile geopolitical situation can impact or elongate 
our decision‑making process of our clients, making it as key 
monitorable topic for our international business in 2024. We 
continuously monitor the economic impact of geopolitical and 
macroeconomic challenges and take appropriate actions.
Cyberattack incidents globally continue to increase in 
number and sophistication, especially in the current hybrid 
working environment. Several new age tools and advanced 
security controls are being deployed to enhance information 
and cyber security posture. In addition, during the year an 
enhanced level of awareness was imparted to all employees 
to remain vigilant against pertinent themes of information 
and cyber security. 
The emergence of large language models (LLMs) brings 
several knowledge work categories, presently manual in 
nature, potentially within the scope of generative artificial 
intelligence (Al). As part of our LLM strategy, we have identified 
focus areas for evaluation. 
Our Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) philosophy has 
established a vibrant workplace that enriches employee 
experience. We benchmark our compensation on an ongoing 
basis to ensure our employees are fairly paid, in line with 
market trends.
Additionally, the Company continued monitoring top risks on 
its risk register, which are discussed in greater detail in the 
Management Discussion and Analysis Report.

subsidiaries have expanded their scope of services to support 
S&P Group Entities in various non-financial analytical 
streams beyond credit ratings, such as ESG assessments and 
consulting, model validation, counter-party risk assessments, 
data operations and technology support, which are provided 
by other divisions of CRISIL and/or its subsidiaries (other than 
GAC division). It is therefore proposed to expand the scope, 
coverage and limit of the existing related party approval

ensuing Annual General Meeting of the Company.
The Audit Committee pre-approves all Related Party 
Transactions. The details of such transactions undertaken 
during a particular quarter are placed at the meeting of the 
Audit Committee held in the succeeding quarter.

materially significant or could have a potential conflict with 
the interests of the Company at large.
All Related Party Transactions are mentioned in the notes 
to the accounts. The particulars of material contracts or 
arrangements with related parties referred to in Section

Ratings services
The domestic credit rating business received a boost from 
healthy bond issuances and steady bank credit growth 
in 2023.
Going ahead, the bond segment is likely to see some 
moderation in growth in 2024, mainly owing to higher bond 
yields in the first half of 2024.
Bank credit growth eased somewhat to mid-teens on an on-
year basis in 2023, and will likely continue along this trajectory 
or moderate somewhat, especially if borrowers postpone their 
borrowing plans after taking the high rates and challenging 
global macroeconomic situation into account.
The government’s increased investment initiatives are expected 
to continue driving infrastructure spending and revitalising 
the capital expenditure cycle within this sector, while revival of 
capex in other industries may continue to be gradual.
Overall, credit climate is expected to remain benign in 2024, 
with the credit ratio (ratio of number of rating upgrades 
to number of rating downgrades) remaining above 1 and 
relatively low leverage in corporate India. With expected 
slower global growth, we expect to see continued risks for the 
credit profiles of entities in export-oriented sectors.
Research, Analytics and Solutions
CRISIL MI&A
•	
Research
	
Our services are witnessing increased demand in pivotal 
sectors. The Indian government’s initiatives such as 
the Credit Guarantee Fund Scheme for MSMEs and 
PM Kisan in agriculture drive this surge. These sectors 
collectively constitute 49% of India’s gross domestic 
product, becoming our prime focus in 2023 and 
continuing into 2024. Additionally, the growing interest 
in green hydrogen and electric vehicles, prompted by 
the 2030 targets, fuels increased service demand. 
Notably, there is significant interest in banking sector, 
thought leadership and franchise building following 
global shocks in early-2023, propelling the industry to 
reassess strategies. Hence, banking, financial services 
and insurance emerges as a focal point for the upcoming 
year, 2024.
•	
Consulting
	
Increased infrastructure investment and local 
economic progress helped our Consulting division. 
Surge in government, multilateral and investor 
spending, especially in roads, renewable energy and 
urban infrastructure, is anticipated to persist in 2024. 
Furthermore, we anticipate further expansion into 
international markets, projecting substantial spending 
from both multilateral and bilateral agencies.
•	
Risk Solutions, Data and Analytics
	
Our Risk Solutions business benefitted from Asset 
Classification and Provisioning (ACP) gaining momentum 
during the year. Our 2024 focus entails delivering end-to-
end enterprise risk management frameworks. We aim 
to augment assessments for diverse entities, including 
lenders, corporates, MSMEs and NGOs. Our platforms 
aid financial institutions in holistic risk management 
and regulatory compliance.
	
As we look ahead, our strategic focus on data analytics 
remains key. We are committed to leveraging advanced 
data analytics, including artificial intelligence (AI) and 
machine learning, to deliver targeted solutions. Our 
diverse suite of analytics offerings will continue to drive 
tailored strategies for customers, pricing decisions and 
engagement. Strengthening insights across sectors and 
enhancing decision-making capabilities will be our key 
focus areas.
International Business
The global macroeconomic situation remained complex in 
2023. World growth was higher than expected and inflation, 
despite peaking, was above target for many central banks. 
The operating environment was characterised by the failure 
of a few regional banks in the US and the consolidation of 
a large European bank. We saw growth across our global 
businesses despite macro uncertainties and cost pressure on 
global clients. In 2024, the expected soft landing of the global 
economy could have a bearing on discretionary spends by 
global clients. We remain focused on customer centricity and

The Risk Solutions business saw increased client 
engagement in areas such as regulatory compliance and 
reporting, targeted review of internal models and stress 
testing initiatives, and lending solutions, leading to wins 
with existing and new clients.
	
Traditional sell-side research faced cost-cutting 
pressures amid headwinds driven by factors such as a 
challenging deal environment, regional banking crises, 
inflationary pressures, recessionary concerns and 
ongoing budget pressure. On the buy side, strong traction 
was seen in research and operations, accompanied by a 
resurgence in demand from traditional Asset Managers 
across asset classes. There was sustained demand for 
ESG integration and monitoring services.
•	
CRISIL GBA
	
In corporate and investment banking (CIB), there is 
a greater need for data to target opportunities and 
efficiencies in a normalising revenue environment with 
increasing costs. The Relationship Manager model 
is used to identify opportunities to support strategic 
initiatives at major clients. Securing budgets for new 
initiatives at major CIBs requires a deeper and well 
thought-through approach.
	
In commercial and consumer banking (CCB), there is 
a growing interest among regional US & Asia banks, 
as they look to accelerate growth in a challenging 
business environment.
	
In investment management (IM), AMs continue to focus 
on ESG and other strategic imperatives.
	
In market structure and technology (MST), there is 
continued traction at conferences/seminars for thought 
leadership across various topics.
	
Looking at the longer-term outlook, the importance of 
proprietary data assets is expected to rise. Embedded 
models are anticipated to aid in exploring wider budgets 
as a firm’s offerings broaden over time.

Risk management
CRISIL has a robust risk management framework, with 
governance and oversight from CRISIL’s Board of Directors.
CRISIL’s Risk Management Policy outlines the key 
accountabilities and responsibilities for managing risks at 
CRISIL. We have a balanced approach to risk management, 
mitigating risks to an acceptable level to protect our 
reputation and brand, while supporting the achievement of 
operational and strategic goals and objectives.
Risk assessments are conducted periodically, and the 
Company has a mechanism to identify, assess, mitigate and 
monitor various risks to key business objectives. CRISIL’s 
Internal Risk Management Committee, comprising senior 
members of the leadership team, provides governance 
and oversight to the process. CRISIL has a dedicated 
President – Risk and Compliance, who drives the risk 
management agenda.
Risk Assessment is a combination of bottom-up and strategic 
views of key risks facing the business across all segments and 
functions, arrived at in consultation with the relevant leaders 
and tempered by an independent assessment. Key risks are 
reviewed periodically and assigned a probability of occurrence 
and potential impact (financial and non-financial). Mitigation 
plans are designed, discussed, implemented and monitored 
on a periodic basis.
The key business risks and our mitigation strategies are 
highlighted below:
1.	
Business Risks
	
The challenging macroeconomic environment and 
volatile geopolitical situation can impact or elongate 
the decision-making process of our clients, posing 
challenges to the international business in 2024. We 
continuously monitor the economic impact of geopolitical 
and macroeconomic challenges and take appropriate 
actions, such as aligning sales efforts to reflect evolving 
client prioritisation and market preferences. Enhancing 
our presence in white spaces and venturing into new 
geographies are our preferred routes for diversifying our 
revenue mix.
	
To mitigate the risk arising from revenue dependence 
on any one business, CRISIL has diversified into 
new products and services, offered across business 
segments. To address the risk of dependence on a few 
Integrity

Annual Report 2023-
large clients, CRISIL has actively widened its client base 
and diversified the industry segments that it serves.
2.	
Foreign Exchange Risk
	
CRISIL earns a significant amount of revenue in foreign 
currency. Hence, rupee appreciation or depreciation 
may have a material impact on revenue and profitability. 
The Company follows a well-defined foreign exchange 
management policy and process, designed to minimise 
the impact of volatility in foreign exchange fluctuations 
on earnings.
	
The Company evaluates exchange rate exposure arising 
from global business and operations, and enters into 
foreign exchange hedging contracts to mitigate exchange 
rate risk. CRISIL’s foreign exchange management 
programme covers a large portion of projected future 
revenue over a 12-month period, and is restricted to 
standard forward contracts and options. Appropriate 
internal controls are in place for monitoring the use of 
these instruments.
3.	
Technological Disruption Risk – Generative Artificial 
Intelligence (Generative AI)
	
The present era is one of unprecedented technological 
development. The emergence of large language models 
(LLMs), in particular, brings several knowledge work 
categories, presently manual in nature, potentially within 
the scope of generative artificial intelligence (Al). We are 
assessing the potential for LLM adoption in our various 
business segments.
	
As of now, given the intellectual property-driven nature 
of our flagship businesses, and the relatively slow pace 
of adoption amongst clients, we believe the effects 
over the medium term will be gradual. This allows us to 
implement mitigants where feasible, and explore new 
business opportunities that LLMs can create. As part of 
our LLM strategy, we have also identified potential areas 
for evaluation.
	
The space is dynamic and evolving, and we are 
monitoring developments.
4.	
People Risk
	
As a knowledge organisation, key people-related 
risks for CRISIL include higher-than-optimal attrition, 
mismatches in the talent pipeline and a lack of ready 
candidates for internal succession.
	
Talent acquisition and development: We have stepped 
up our hiring programmes through a mix of hiring 
talent from campuses, infusing lateral talent from the 
wider market and fostering internal mobility. We offer 
ample opportunities to employees for skill-building 
and reskilling to ensure a future-ready talent pool that 
can serve the evolving needs of customers. Leadership 
talent is nurtured through our focused development 
programme for future leaders, which grooms successors 
for critical roles within the organisation, ensuring our 
investment in our key talent yields an ongoing long-
term return.
	
Talent retention: CRISIL is known for its safe and 
inclusive working environment, where employees from 
different backgrounds, and with varied skillsets, feel 
motivated and valued. Our Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion 
(DEI) philosophy has established a vibrant workplace 
that enriches employee experience. We benchmark 
our compensation on an ongoing basis to ensure our 
employees are fairly paid, in line with market trends. We 
rigorously measure employee engagement, and act upon 
opportunities to enhance it. These measures have helped 
contain employee attrition in a highly dynamic market.
	
Employee welfare: Our holistic approach to employee 
well-being balances physical, emotional and financial 
aspects. Our wellness policies and benefits are 
continuously benchmarked with market best practices. 
CRISIL follows responsible business practices, protects 
human rights and has high standards of corporate 
governance to give employees a work environment in 
which they can grow and thrive.
5.	
Legal, Regulatory, and Policy Risks
	
CRISIL operates in a number of geographies and policy 
jurisdictions. Any failure to comply with the applicable 
policies, laws, and regulations could adversely impact 
growth and profitability, and increase exposure to civil 
and/or criminal actions. This could lead to damages, 
fines and regulatory sanctions against CRISIL, with 
possible consequences for corporate reputation. 
Consequently, we have robust mechanisms in place to 
maximise compliance.
	
Compliance: CRISIL is committed to complying with the 
laws and regulations of the countries in which it operates. 
The relevant business teams set detailed standards and 
ensure all employees are aware of and comply with the 
relevant regulations and laws. Our Legal and Compliance 
teams monitor and review our practices to provide 
reasonable assurance that we remain aware of and are 
in line with all relevant laws and legal obligations.
	
Tax: Our tax principles provide overarching governance in 
tax matters, and our experts set out controls to assess 
and monitor tax risk for direct and indirect taxes. We

monitor proposed changes in taxation legislation 
and ensure these are considered when we formulate 
business plans.
	
Monitoring: We monitor regulatory developments closely 
and engage with regulators, as appropriate, contributing 
our expertise to help shape regulations that can be 
implemented effectively. We also work with industry 
and trade associations in making recommendations on 
newer and evolving regulations in a timely manner.
6.	
Information and Cybersecurity Risks
	
Cyberattack incidents globally continue to increase in 
number and sophistication, especially in the current 
hybrid working environment. In addition to the impact 
on business operations, a data breach could result 
in reputational damage, legal claims and financial 
liabilities. Unauthorised sharing of client confidential 
data or CRISIL proprietary information by staff is another 
important risk related to data security.
	
To manage and mitigate such risks, the Company has 
a dedicated Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) 
driving the information and cybersecurity agenda. 
The CISO and the Information Security team acts as a 
second line of defence, strengthening the information 
and cybersecurity position by defining the appropriate 
perimeter security controls, detecting and evaluating 
areas of vulnerabilities, and implementing data loss 
prevention (DLP) tools. There is a focused exercise to 
build robust security process, policies and posture for 
the cloud since our technology transformation process 
increasingly leverages cloud infrastructure, applications 
and tools. The Company continues to evaluate and 
invest in additional mitigation plans through automated 
prevention and detection tools and infrastructure for 
enhanced monitoring.
	
In addition, during the year, an enhanced level of 
awareness was imparted to all employees to remain 
vigilant against pertinent themes of information security 
and cybersecurity. This was done by way of digital 
learning courses, external speaker sessions, emailers 
and case studies. Audits are conducted regularly to 
identify areas of vulnerability and initiate actions that 
mitigate the operational risks. ISO 27001 certification 
of key processes is conducted to ensure compliance 
with policies related to information technology and the 
management system.

As per the Articles of Association of the Company, at least 
two-third of the Board members shall be retiring Directors, 
excluding Independent Directors. One-third of such Directors 
are required to retire every year and, if eligible, the retiring 
Directors qualify for re-appointment. The Managing Director 
is appointed by the shareholders for a period of five years but 
can be reappointed on completion of the term, if eligible. The 
employment may be terminated by either party by giving three 
months’ notice. Independent Directors shall hold office for up 
to two terms of five years each.
Succession policy
The Board constantly evaluates the contribution of its 
members and recommends to shareholders their re-
appointment if thought fit, upon expiry of their respective 
tenures. The Nomination and Remuneration Committee 
of the Board regularly reviews the succession planning 
and competency planning priorities of the Board and 
Senior Management.
The Board has adopted a retirement policy for its members. 
The maximum age of retirement for Executive Directors is 
60 years, provided that the term of the person holding this 
position may be extended beyond the age of 60 years with 
the approval of shareholders by passing a special resolution.
Details of shareholdings of Directors as at 
December 31, 2023
None of the Directors, except Mr Amish Mehta, Managing 
Director & CEO, held any shares in the Company as at 
December 31, 2023. Mr Mehta held 37,819 shares and 4,332 
options (vested and unvested) under the Company’s ESOS, 
2014 as at December 31, 2023.
Certificate from Practicing Company Secretary 
regarding Non-Debarment and Non-Disqualification 
of Directors
The Company has obtained a certificate from M/s MMJB & 
Associates LLP, Practicing Company Secretaries, confirming 
that none of the Directors on the Board of the Company 
have been debarred or disqualified from being appointed or 
continuing as Director of the Company by the Securities and 
Exchange Board of India and Ministry of Corporate Affairs or 
any such authority, and the same forms part of this report as 
Annexure II.
Responsibilities
The Board takes decisions on long-term strategic planning, 
annual budget approvals and policy formulation. The Board 
also has strong operational oversight and reviews business 
plans, key risks and opportunities in the business context. 
The Board meets at least four times every calendar year and 
the maximum time gap between any two meetings is not more 
than 120 days. During the year ended December 31, 2023, 
the Board met five times — on February 16, April 18, July 17, 
September 12 and November 7.
A detailed agenda, setting out the business to be transacted 
at the meeting(s), supported by notes and presentations 
and action taken reports from previous meetings, where 
applicable, is sent to each Director at least seven days before 
the date of the Board and Committee meetings. The Directors 
are also provided the facility of video conferencing to enable 
them to participate effectively in the meeting(s), as and when 
required. All procedures stipulated under the Secretarial 
Standards and other legal requirements were complied with 
in the conduct of these meetings.
The Board members are highly involved in Company matters 
and the attendance record at such meetings, mentioned under 
Table 3.6 of the Corporate Governance Report, reflects the 
level of involvement, dedication and time allocated by them. 
Board members actively seek and attend trainings and off-
cycle discussions on various topics pertinent to the Company. 
Engaging discussions with experts on emerging trends in the 
economy and global financial markets and interactions with 
employees and clients are some of the notable events where 
Board members have participated whole-heartedly.
The Company has an Executive Committee, comprising the 
Managing Director and a team of senior leaders, with proper 
demarcation of responsibilities and authority. The Managing 
Director is responsible for corporate strategy, planning, 
external contacts and Board matters. The heads of individual 
businesses and the CRISIL leadership team are responsible 
for business development, customer relations, day-to-
day operations-related issues, profitability, productivity, 
recruitment, and employee retention in their divisions. 
Important decisions taken by the Board and its Committees 
are promptly communicated to the leadership team concerned 
for execution; status reports on actions taken are reported at 
subsequent meeting(s).
Role of Independent Directors and familiarisation 
process
As trustees of shareholders, Independent Directors play 
a pivotal role in upholding corporate governance norms 
and ensuring fairness in decision-making. Being experts 
in various fields, they also bring independent judgement 
on matters of strategy, risk management, controls and 
business performance. The Directors’ Report contains the 
Statutory Reports

CRISIL

requisite disclosures regarding fulfilment of the requisite 
independence criteria by CRISIL’s Independent Directors.
At the time of appointing a new Independent Director, a 
formal letter of appointment is given to the Director, inter 
alia, explaining their roles, duties and responsibilities. The 
Director is also explained in detail the compliances required 
from him / her under the Act, SEBI Regulations and other 
relevant regulations and his / her affirmation is taken with 
respect to the same.
By way of an introduction to the Company, presentations are 
also made to the newly appointed Independent Directors on 
relevant information, such as an overview of the various CRISIL 
businesses, offerings, market and business environment, 
growth and performance, organisational set-up of the 
Company, governance, and internal control processes.
The familiarisation aims to provide insights into the Company 
and the business environment in which it operates. It enables 
the Independent Directors to be updated of newer challenges, 
risks and opportunities relevant in the Company’s context and 
to lend perspective on its strategic direction. The Company’s 
policy of conducting the familiarisation programme and 
the details of familiarisation programmes imparted to 
Independent Directors during 2023 have been disclosed on 
the Company website at https://www.crisil.com/en/home/
investors/corporate-governance.html.
The above initiatives help the Directors to understand CRISIL, 
the business and the regulatory framework in which the 
Company operates and equip them to effectively discharge 
their role as a Director of the Company.
Directors are covered under the Directors & Officers’ Liability 
Insurance Policy and the terms of the same have been 
reviewed by the Board.

companies to receive complaints from investors against 
them, redress such complaints and report redressal. All 
activities, from lodging of a complaint to disposal, are 
carried out online automatically and the status of every 
complaint can be checked online at any time. CRISIL 
is registered on SCORES and endeavours to resolve 
all investor complaints received through SCORES or 
otherwise within the prescribed timelines.
Further, SEBI vide circular SEBI/HO/OIAE/OIAE_IAD-
1/P/CIR/2023/131 dated July 31, 2023, has introduced 
an Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) mechanism for 
investors/clients. Shareholders can initiate dispute 
resolution through the ODR portal https://smartodr.in/
login without having to go through the SCORES portal if 
the grievance lodged with the Company is not resolved 
satisfactorily. Dispute resolution through the ODR 
portal can be initiated only if such complaint/ dispute is 
not pending before any arbitral process, court, tribunal 
or consumer forum. In 2023, no complaint was received 
through SCORES/ODR.

21. 	 Dividend
	
Dividend Policy: CRISIL believes in maintaining a 
fair balance between cash retention and dividend 
distribution. Cash retention is required to finance 
acquisitions and future growth and also as a means 
to meet any unforeseen contingency. CRISIL’s Dividend 
Policy specifies the financial parameters that would 
be considered when declaring a dividend, the internal 
and external factors that would be considered for 
declaring a dividend, and the circumstances under which 
shareholders can or cannot expect a dividend. The Policy 
has been uploaded to the Company’s website, www.crisil.
com/en/home/investors/corporate-governance.html; it 
is also annexed herewith as Annexure I.
	
Modes of payment of dividend: Dividend is paid through 
the following two modes:
	
(a)	
Credit to the bank account via Electronic Clearing 
Service (ECS)/ National Electronic Clearing Service 
(NECS)/ SWIFT transfer
	
(b) 	 Despatch of physical dividend warrants/ cheques
	
Tax on dividend: The Finance Act, 2021, abolished the 
Dividend Distribution Tax (DDT) and made dividend 
income taxable in the hands of the recipient shareholders, 
with effect from April 1, 2021. CRISIL has made the 
necessary changes in its dividend payment process in 
coordination with internal and external stakeholders, 
such as the Registrar and Share Transfer Agent and 
bankers. The Company regularly sends communication 
to its shareholders before each dividend, requesting 
them to submit the required documents for claiming 
beneficial tax rates, if applicable.
	
ECS/ NECS: CRISIL has extended the ECS/ NECS facility 
to shareholders to enable them to receive dividend 
through the electronic mode in their bank account. 
The Company encourages members to use this facility, 
as ECS/ NECS provides adequate protection against 
fraudulent interception and encashment of dividend 
warrants, in addition to eliminating loss/ damage of 
dividend warrants in transit and correspondence with 
the Company on revalidation/ issuance of duplicate 
dividend warrants. Investors may obtain the ECS/ NECS 
mandate form from the FAQs link (https://www.crisil.
com/en/home/investors/shareholder-services/faqs.
html) in the Investors section of the Company’s website, 
www.crisil.com.
	
Bank details for electronic shareholding: Members 
are requested to furnish complete details of their bank 
accounts, including the bank’s MICR code, to their 
DPs. They are also requested to notify their DPs about 
changes in bank details.
	
Unclaimed dividend: Dividend that is not encashed or 
claimed within seven years from the date of its transfer 
to the unpaid dividend account will, in terms of the 
provisions of Section 124(5) of the Companies Act, 2013, 
be transferred to the Investor Education and Protection 
Fund (IEPF) established by the government. In respect of 
the transfers made after coming into effect of the IEPF 
Authority (Accounting, Audit, Transfer and Refund) Rules, 
2016, shareholders will be entitled to claim the dividend 
transferred from the IEPF in accordance with such 
procedure and on submission of such documents as may 
be prescribed. The details of unclaimed dividend as at 
December 31, 2023 and the dates when the dividend will 
be transferred to the IEPF are as follows:

It is my privilege to present CRISIL’s third 
annual ESG report, which reflects our initiatives 
towards building a sustainable culture and the 
outcomes thereof. It underlines key ESG risks 
and opportunities material to our long-term value 
creation process.
In 2023, we expanded our ESG coverage, improved 
disclosures and published our ESG policy that 
reiterated our commitment to responsible and 
sustainable business conduct. We initiated a 
materiality reassessment to improve our ESG 
quotient and to focus on areas needing urgent 
action.
We remain committed to making meaningful social 
impact.
In 2023, we moved to minimise our environmental 
footprint, by using renewable sources for more 
than half of our energy requirements, reducing 
Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions, recycling 90%+ 
waste and planting 54,000 trees.
We believe diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) 
help foster the innovation essential to our long-
term sustainable growth. I am happy to inform that 
women represents 39% of our workforce and 39% 
of all hires in 2023.
Over 15 diversity-themed trainings were conducted 
for employees in 2023. That, and the launch of 
Eskalera, an online learning platform designed to 
cultivate an inclusive work culture, were among the 
few ways in which we reaffirmed out commitment 
to DEI.
The above ensures employees get ample 
opportunities to learn, grow and most importantly, 
belong.
As a part of our community initiatives, CRISIL 
Foundation empowered more than 6 lakh rural 
women through financial literacy programmes in 
Assam and Rajasthan, making them self-reliant.
As a part of our

We remain relentless in our emphasis on corporate 
governance and doing business the right way.
Value creation and sustainable business practices 
are complementary, not disparate, goals. Our ESG 
journey is a testimony to that approach.
To our stakeholders, thank you for joining us in this 
quest.

business and corporate teams, leading to necessary actions, ensuring no material gaps remains un-addressed.

Leadership Indicators
1)	 Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and social topics or if 
consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.
	
We believe proactive and continuous engagement with key stakeholders is crucial to the success of a business enterprise. At CRISIL, 
feedback gathered in the course of engagement with stakeholders is taken into account and, after due evaluation, is incorporated to 
improve business processes. Significant learnings may also help shape our strategic initiatives and growth levers. Stakeholders are 
encouraged to put forth any concerns relating to their engagement with us and reach out to our senior management, if necessary. The 
engagement scores, complaints and other feedback from stakeholders are monitored at various levels of the management. They also 
receive the highest attention from the Board/Board committee in its reporting processes.
2)	 Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, and social topics 
(Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these topics were incorporated into 
policies and activities of the entity.
	
Yes.
	
At CRISIL, consultation with the stakeholders is important for management of the ESG attributes in the areas such as governance 
oversight, employee enablement and well being, diversity & inclusion, stakeholder engagement and ESG offerings. Our top material 
issues were identified and prioritized based on their impact on our stakeholders and our business. Such feedback is an important input 
while devising goals and plans in these areas. Please Refer to Table 8 of the ESG Databook on the process for determining material 
ESG issues. 
3)	 Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/ marginalized 
stakeholder groups. 
	
CRISIL has adopted a Policy on Equal Opportunities at Workplace whereby it commits to ensuring equal opportunity across the 
organization in all matters of employment and a workplace free from discrimination. We have a very diverse set of employees across 
the world, by gender, age and nationality. We are committed to ensuring an inclusive environment for all employees, where they can look 
forward to bringing their true, whole self to work each day.
	
Consultation with stakeholders is important for management of the ESG attributes in areas of diversity and inclusion, stakeholder 
engagement and ESG offerings. Such feedback is an important input while devising goals and plans in these areas.
	
Promoting women leaders
	
It has been our constant endeavor at CRISIL to enable and encourage women to have thriving careers. There is a conscious approach to 
increase representation of women at managerial and above levels. Considerable efforts on growth and development of women leaders 
have yielded substantial impact – hiring efforts across levels (from campus hires to leadership levels with differential referral incentives), 
internal pool of mentors for women employees in mid-career levels, coaching opportunities and competency-based development 
journey. 39% of our workforce and 22% of our leadership include women.
	
Hiring and retention related initiatives for women talent
	
CRISIL ensures adequate representation of women in the candidate slate for all open positions. Multiple channels – job fairs, campuses, 
lateral candidates from job market - are leveraged for the same. Early career women talent is leveraged from multiple campuses. Gender 
diversity, as a metric, is a reference while taking hiring decisions at entry level to ensure proportional representation at ground level. 
Governance checks are deployed at key milestones in the hiring process to alleviate any bias on selection or offer fitment. Internal 
mobility of employees is encouraged before external candidates are evaluated for any given position. Leadership Excellence and 
Accelerated Development (LEAD), Leadership Excellence Program (LEP) and the 1,000 Women Leaders Program in association with 
Jombay are some key initiatives towards building a strong pipeline of women leaders at CRISIL.

We migrated our largest energy consuming premise, CRISIL House Mumbai, to 100% renewable energy commencing 2023, thereby 
contributing towards significant reduction of our carbon footprint. This contributed to a significant 64% reduction in our Scope 1 & 2 
carbon emission over 2019. Proportion of energy consumption from renewable sources enhanced from 5% last year to 58% in 2023.
	
CRISIL adheres to a comprehensive accounting for indirect emissions by incorporating business travel, work-from-home, capital 
purchases and other purchased goods into Scope 3. Our Scope 3 thus encompasses 85% of total emissions. CRISIL continued collecting 
actual emission data from its supply chain to enhance the accounting for GHG emissions. Sensitization and encouragement of supply 
chain to begin monitoring and disclosing the carbon impact of their operations remains the main goal.
	
Furthermore, there was increased attention on tracking our carbon footprint through business travel which contributes to 30% of our 
overall Scope 3 emissions. During 2023, we introduced a tracker of travel related emissions by business, in our effort to keep such 
emissions at acceptable level.

CRISIL’s business processes are automated through bespoke applications that capture and maintain information about business 
processes, client agreements, reports generated, and assignments delivered, thus creating an adequate database for our knowledge. 
	
The company has outlined a Business Continuity Policy (BCP). The BCP outlines critical processes, downtime tolerance, and planned 
recovery methodologies, and ensures requisite alternative strategies are defined in the recovery plan. At the same time, it ensures 
safety of teams during emergencies. Crisis communications is embedded in the BCP. The technology department remains abreast of the

6.	 Disclose any significant adverse impact to the environment, arising from the value chain of the entity. What mitigation or adaptation 
measures have been taken by the entity in this regard?
	
At CRISIL, we measure our carbon footprint by considering emissions not only from our own operations, but also from upstream activities, 
such as the procurement of capital goods and other purchases. Our supply chain has emerged as a significant contributor to our carbon 
footprint, surpassing emissions from our own facilities. CRISIL is focused on sensitising, raising awareness and fostering behavioural 
changes within its supply chain.
	
CRISIL requires its suppliers to report GHG emissions stemming from the lifecycle of their products and services. This information is 
crucial for various reporting requirements, including BRSR. We actively encourage and support our supply chain partners in measuring 
and disclosing the carbon footprint of their operations. Towards this end CRISIL decided to request emission value from suppliers where 
aggregate purchase order value exceeds C 10 Lacs, excluding small and medium enterprises and other similar categories where there 
was a challenge in availability of accurate emissions data. The response received primarily refined our approach towards data collection 
in relation to indirect emissions through supply chain.

Mein Pragati, the flagship CSR programme, is currently being implemented in over 5,000 villages of Assam and Rajasthan. This is 
facilitated through a well-trained, all-women community cadre of Sakhis. This cadre has helped address the last-mile constraints in 
awareness and access to financial services. As on date, these sakhis have supported over 2 million rural community members, mostly 
women, by facilitating access to banking, and other financial, and social security schemes.
	
Between 2018 and 2023, the Sakhis have gained confidence and experience, with a majority of them expanding their coverage area to 
adjacent villages.
	
1,550 new Sakhis have been on-boarded during the year, taking the total to 5,200+ Sakhis in over 5,000 villages, spread across 113

Livelihoods in Assam and Rajasthan
	
Financial well-being & independence, and livelihoods opportunities go together and hence, CRISIL Foundation, in 2018 initiated a few livelihood 
pilots (on a small scale) in Assam. Starting with 75 households in 2018, they gained steady momentum through enhanced household coverage, 
and improved income generation for over 1,500 households by 2021. During 2023 a pilot project was started in Didwana, a Mein Pragati village, 
to support 35 unskilled rural women towards rug making and market linkage to improve their monthly incomes.
	
CRISIL Foundation’s efforts through Mein Pragati have led to a larger partnership – the MoneyWise Centre for Financial Literacy (CFL) 
project being implemented in India with support from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), 11 public sector banks and NABARD. This scales-
up CRISIL Foundation’s financial awareness and inclusion efforts through 615 CFLs across over 50,000 villages spread across 14 states 
and four union territories. By building these into timely, relevant, and trusted centres of knowledge, CRISIL has taken a firm step towards 
enabling ‘last-mile financial inclusion’, critical to the country’s long-term development.
	
For its’ CSR efforts, during the year, CRISIL Foundation was awarded the 'CSR Foundation of the Year' (in the small companies’ category) 
at the 9th CSR Impact Awards 2023, organized by CSRBOX and Dalmia Bharat – for its financial capability building and environment

Materiality assessment helps 
in prioritizing the topics and 
analysing the relevant ESG risks 
and opportunities that can be 
integrated in our operations and

revisiting material topics.
 The list of top E, S and G topics has 
been derived through a consultative 
exercise, wherein the priorities 
were evaluated in order of their 
importance to our business and 
our stakeholders. The survey was 
responded by 315 internal and 
external stakeholders.

We migrated our largest energy consuming premise, CRISIL House Mumbai, to renewable energy 
commencing 2023, thereby contributing towards significant reduction of our carbon footprint. 
Proportion of energy consumption from renewable sources enhanced from 5% last year to 58% in 2023.
ii.	
IT hardware, server and network devices  were decommissioned under the cloud migration and tech 
consolidation projects with an aim to reduce CRISIL’s tech debt and legacy infrastructure. CRISIL 
saved 151860 kWh of energy through these projects during 2023.
iii.	 Motion sensors are used to optimise lighting usage.

An S&P Global Company

Statement
This statement is published by CRISIL Ltd about and to 
enable its subsidiaries that are subject to the Act, including 
in particular CRISIL Irevna UK Ltd and Coalition UK Ltd 
(subsidiaries). CRISIL and its subsidiaries are together 
referred to as CRISIL entities.
Forced, bonded or compulsory labour, human trafficking and 
other kinds of slavery signify some of the severest forms 
of human rights abuse. We are committed to improving our 
practices to combat slavery and human trafficking.
Organisational structure
CRISIL Ltd provides ratings, research, and risk and policy 
advisory services in the knowledge process and business 
process outsourcing sector. S&P Global Inc is the parent 
Company. CRISIL has its registered office in Mumbai, India. 
We operate in India, China, Singapore, England, Poland, 
Argentina, Australia, and the United States of America, and 
have about 4,000 employees worldwide. Our global annual 
turnover is in excess of £36 million.
Our supply chains
Our supply chains include consultants, advisors, IT (hardware 
and software), and other office equipment suppliers, 
professional services from our lawyers, accountants and 
other advisers, security, catering, office cleaning and other 
office facilities services, staffing companies, etc. We require 
all of our suppliers to conduct business in a lawful and ethical 
manner as part of our supplier on-boarding process, and 
accept our trading terms and conditions.
Our policies on slavery and human trafficking
We are committed to ensuring that there is no modern slavery 
or human trafficking in our supply chains or in any part of 
our business. Our Modern Slavery Act, 2015, policy reflects 
our commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in all 
our business relationships, and implementing and enforcing 
effective systems and controls, to ensure no slavery and 
human trafficking takes place in our supply chains.
Due-diligence processes for slavery and human 
trafficking
As part of our initiative to identify and mitigate risk, we have 
in place systems to:
• 	 Identify and assess potential risk areas in our supply 
chains
• 	 Mitigate the risk of slavery and human trafficking in our 
supply chains
• 	 Monitor potential risk areas in our supply chains
• 	 Protect whistleblowers
• 	 Where possible, build long-standing relationships with 
local suppliers and make clear our expectations of 
business behaviour
Supplier adherence to our values
We have zero tolerance to slavery and human trafficking. We 
ensure all those in our supply chain and contractors comply 
with our values and ethics.
Training
We provide training to our staff to ensure a high level of 
understanding of the risks of modern slavery and human 
trafficking in our supply chains and our business.
Our effectiveness in combating slavery and 
human trafficking
The Act is relatively new and very few companies, including 
CRISIL entities, have experience of seeking out, let alone 
detecting, slavery or trafficking among their own staff
or among their suppliers. To date, CRISIL entities are yet to 
detect or suspect that any CRISIL entities or suppliers employ 
persons who may be enslaved or trafficked.
Therefore, key performance indicators can be set only in 
respect of reasonable due diligence efforts once experience 
of the initial outputs of such exercises are collated and 
analysed. This statement is made pursuant to Section 54(1) 
of the Modern Slavery Act, 2015, and constitutes our slavery 
and human trafficking statement.

financial statements of CRISIL Limited (‘the Holding 
Company’) and its subsidiaries (the Holding Company 
and its subsidiaries together referred to as ‘the 
Group’), as listed in Annexure I, which comprise the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet as at 31 December 2023,

Other Comprehensive Income), the Consolidated Cash 
Flow Statement and the Consolidated Statement of 
Changes in Equity for the year then ended, and notes 
to the consolidated financial statements, including a 
summary of the significant accounting policies and other 
explanatory information.
2.	
In our opinion and to the best of our information and 
according to the explanations given to us and based on 
the consideration of the reports of the other auditors 
on separate financial statements and on the other 
financial information of the subsidiaries and the branch 
of the holding Company the aforesaid consolidated 
financial statements give the information required by 
the Companies Act, 2013 (‘the Act’) in the manner so 
required and give a true and fair view in conformity with 
the Indian Accounting Standards (‘Ind AS’) specified 
under section 133 of the Act, read with the Companies 
(Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, and other 
accounting principles generally accepted in India of 
the consolidated state of affairs of the Group, as at 31 
December 2023, and their consolidated profit (including 
other comprehensive income), consolidated cash flows 
and the consolidated changes in equity for the year 
ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
3.	
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards 
on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Act. 
Our responsibilities under those standards are further 
described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit 
of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our 
report. We are independent of the Group, in accordance 
with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of 
Chartered Accountants of India (‘ICAI’) together with the 
ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
consolidated financial statements under the provisions 
of the Act and the rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled 
our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with 
these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe 
that the audit evidence we have obtained together with 
the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in 
terms of their reports referred to in paragraph 15 of the 
Other Matter section below is sufficient and appropriate 
to provide a basis for our opinion.
Key Audit Matter
4.	
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our 
professional judgment and based on the consideration 
of the reports of the other auditors on separate financial 
statements of the subsidiaries and branch of the Holding 
Company, were of most significance in our audit of the 
consolidated financial statements of the current period. 
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit 
of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and 
in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a 
separate opinion on these matters.
5.	
We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.

Key audit matter
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
The application of the accounting standard is complex 
and is an area of focus in the audit, as it involved 
application of significant judgements and estimates 
relating to identification of distinct performance 
obligations, determination of transaction price of 
identified performance obligations, the appropriateness 
of the basis used to measure revenue recognized over 
a period. Additionally, the standard mandates robust 
disclosures in respect of revenue and periods over which 
the remaining performance obligations will be satisfied 
subsequent to the balance sheet date.
Due to the significance of the item to the financial 
statements, complexities involved and management 
judgement involved for ensuring appropriateness of 
accounting treatment, this matter has been identified as 
a key audit matter for the current year’s audit.
	•
Evaluated the appropriateness of accounting policies 
selected by the Group on the basis of our understanding 
of the Group, the nature and size of its operation, and the 
requirement of the relevant accounting standards under 
the IND AS framework;
	•
On a sample of contracts, tested the revenue recognition 
and our procedures included:
	
-	
reviewing the contract terms and conditions;
	
-	
evaluating the identification of performance 
obligations of the contract;
	
-	
evaluating the appropriateness of management’s 
assessment of manner of satisfaction of performance 
obligations and consequent recognition of revenue; and
	
-	
evaluating the reasonableness of the estimates 
involved in the recognition of revenue from initial 
rating and surveillance services including testing the 
calculation of fee allocation to rating and surveillance, 
in determining revenue from infrastructure advisory 
and risk management services in accordance with the 
percentage completion method etc.
	•
Tested revenue recognition for cut-off transactions on 
sample basis to assess whether the timing of revenue 
recognition is appropriate; and
	•
Evaluated the appropriateness and adequacy of the 
disclosures made in the accompanying consolidated 
financial statements for revenue recorded during the year.

financial statements. Further, in terms of the provisions 
of the Act the respective Board of Directors of the

companies included in the Group covered under the Act 
are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting 
records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for 
safeguarding the assets of the Group and for preventing 
and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection 
and application of appropriate accounting policies; 
making judgments and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent; and design, implementation and 
maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, 
that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy 
and completeness of the accounting records, relevant 
to the preparation and presentation of the financial 
statements that give a true and fair view and are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or 
error. These financial statements have been used for 
the purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial 
statements by the Board of Directors of the Holding 
Company, as aforesaid.
8.	
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the 
respective Board of Directors of the companies included 
in the Group are responsible for assessing the ability of 
the Group to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as 
applicable, matters related to going concern and using 
the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board 
of Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to 
cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to 
do so.
9.	
Those respective Board of Directors are also responsible 
for overseeing the financial reporting process of the 
companies included in the Group.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements
10.	 Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the consolidated financial statements as a 
whole are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that 
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high 
level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit 
conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing will 
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
consolidated financial statements.
11.	 As part of an audit in accordance with Standards on 
Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Act 
we exercise professional judgment and maintain 
professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
	•
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement 
of the consolidated financial statements, whether due 
to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures 
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting 
from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as 
fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;
	•
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to 
the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of 
the Act we are also responsible for expressing our opinion 
on whether the Holding Company has adequate internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements 
in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls;
	•
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used 
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and 
related disclosures made by management;
	•
Conclude on the appropriateness of Board of Directors’ 
use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based 
on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material 
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that 
may cast significant doubt on the ability of the Group and 
its associates and joint ventures to continue as a going 
concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, 
we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report 
to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if 
such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our 
conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up 
to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events 
or conditions may cause the Group and its associates and 
joint ventures to cease to continue as a going concern;
	•
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content 
of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and 
whether the financial statements represent the underlying 
transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair 
presentation; and
	•
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the 
financial statements of the entities or business activities 
within the Group, to express an opinion on the consolidated 
financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, 
supervision and performance of the audit of financial 
statements of such entities included in the financial 
statements, of which we are the independent auditors. 
For the other entities included in the financial statements, 
which have been audited by the other auditors, such other 
auditors remain responsible for the direction, supervision 
and performance of the audits carried out by them. We 
remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

12.	 We communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope 
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, 
including any significant deficiencies in internal control 
that we identify during our audit.
13.	 We also provide those charged with governance with 
a statement that we have complied with relevant 
ethical requirements regarding independence, and to 
communicate with them all relationships and other 
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
14.	 From the matters communicated with those charged 
with governance, we determine those matters that 
were of most significance in the audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and are therefore 
the key audit matters. We describe these matters in 
our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes 
public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely 
rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should 
not be communicated in our report because the 
adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably 
be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of 
such communication.
Other Matter
15.	 We did not audit the financial statements of 
seven (7) subsidiaries and one (1) branch, whose 
financial statements reflects total assets of C 10,962 
lakh and net assets of C 7,145 lakh as at 31 December 
2023, total revenues of C 9,633 lakh and net cash inflows 
amounting to C 1,977 lakh for the year ended on that date, 
as considered in the consolidated financial statements.

financial statements, in so far as it relates to the amounts 
and disclosures included in respect of these subsidiaries

of section 143 of the Act in so far as it relates to the 
aforesaid subsidiaries and branch, are based solely on 
the reports of the other auditors and branch auditor.
	
Further, of these subsidiaries, five (5) subsidiaries and 
one (1) branch are located outside India whose financial 
statements and other financial information have been 
prepared in accordance with accounting principles 
generally accepted in their respective countries and 
which have been audited by other auditors under 
generally accepted auditing standards applicable in 
their respective countries. The Holding Company’s 
management has converted the financial statements 
of such subsidiaries and branch located outside India 
from accounting principles generally accepted in 
their respective countries to accounting principles 
generally accepted in India. We have audited these 
conversion adjustments made by the Holding Company’s 
management. Our opinion on the consolidated financial 
statements, in so far as it relates to the amounts and 
disclosures included in respect of such subsidiaries and 
branch located outside India, is based on the report of 
other auditors and branch auditors and the conversion 
adjustments prepared by the management of the 
Holding Company and audited by us.
	
Our opinion above on the consolidated financial 
statements, and our report on other legal and regulatory 
requirements below, are not modified in respect of 
the above matters with respect to our reliance on the 
work done by and the reports of the other auditors and 
branch auditor.

financial controls with reference to financial statements 
of the Holding Company and its subsidiary companies, 
as aforesaid, based on our audit. We conducted our audit 
in accordance with the Standards on Auditing issued by 
the ICAI prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to 
the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements, and the 
Guidance Note issued by the ICAI. Those Standards and 
the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical 
requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements 
were established and maintained and if such controls 
operated effectively in all material respects.
4.	
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements and 
their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements 
includes obtaining an understanding of such internal 
financial controls, assessing the risk that a material 
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design 
and operating effectiveness of internal control based 
on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend 
on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment 
of the risks of material misstatement of the financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error.
5.	
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinion on the internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements of the Holding Company, its 
subsidiary companies, as aforesaid.

Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with 
Reference to Financial Statements
6.	
A Company’s internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements is a process designed to 
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability 
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial 
statements for external purposes in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles. A Company’s 
internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements include those policies and procedures 
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, 
in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect 
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of 
the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that 
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit 
preparation of financial statements in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles, and 
that receipts and expenditures of the Company are 
being made only in accordance with authorisations of 
management and directors of the Company; and (3) 
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or 
timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or 
disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a 
material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial 
Controls with Reference to Financial Statements
7.	
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements, including 
the possibility of collusion or improper management 
override of controls, material misstatements due to error 
or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections 
of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements to future periods are 
subject to the risk that the internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements may become 
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that 
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures 
may deteriorate.
Opinion
8.	
In our opinion, the Holding Company and its subsidiary 
companies, which are companies covered under the Act, 
have in all material respects, adequate internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements and such 
controls were operating effectively as at 31 December 
2023, based on the internal financial controls with 
reference to Consolidated Financial Statements criteria 
established by the respective Companies considering 
the essential components of internal control stated in 
the Guidance Note issued by the ICAI.
Other Matter
9.	
We did not audit the internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements in so far as it relates 
to two (2) subsidiaries, which are companies covered 
under the Act, whose financial statements reflect total 
assets of C 1,446 lakh and net assets of C 1,259 lakh as 
at 31 December 2023, total revenues of C 104 lakh and 
net cash inflows amounting to C 1,241 lakh for the year 
ended on that date, as considered in the consolidated 
financial statements. The internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements in so far as it relates to 
such subsidiary companies have been audited by other 
auditors whose reports have been furnished to us by 
the management and our report on the adequacy and 
operating effectiveness of the internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements for the Holding 
Company and its subsidiary companies, as aforesaid, 
under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act in so far as it relates 
to such subsidiary companies, is based solely on the 
reports of the auditors of such companies. Our opinion 
is not modified in respect of this matter with respect to 
our reliance on the work done by and on the reports of 
the other auditors.

Summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information to the 
consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended December 31, 2023
1. 	 Corporate Information
	
 CRISIL Limited (‘the Company’ or ‘CRISIL’ or ‘Parent’) 
(CIN: L67120MH1987PLC042363) and its subsidiaries 
(collectively referred to as ‘the Group’) is a globally-

CRISIL Limited is a public limited company, domiciled 
in India. The registered office of the Company is located 
at CRISIL House, Central Avenue, Hiranandani Business 
Park, Powai, Mumbai - 400076. The equity shares of the 
Company are listed on recognised stock exchanges in 
India-the Bombay Stock Exchange and the National 
Stock Exchange.
	
S&P Global Inc. the ultimate Holding Company, through 
its subsidiaries owned 66.65% as on December 31, 2023 
of the Company’s equity share capital. (refer to note 19).
	
These consolidated financial statements for the year 
ended December 31, 2023 were approved by the Board 
of Directors on February 16, 2024.	
2.	 Summary of significant accounting policies
2.1	 Statement of compliance
	
These consolidated financial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with the Indian Accounting 
Standards (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Ind AS’) as 
notified by Ministry of Corporate Affairs pursuant to 
Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with 
Rule 3 of the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 
Rules, 2015 as amended from time to time.  
2.2	 Basis of consolidation
	
The Company consolidates all entities which are 
controlled by it. The consolidated financial statements 
comprise the financial statements of the Company and 
its subsidiaries as disclosed in note 2.6. Control exists 
when the Company has power over the entity, is exposed, 
or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement 
with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns 
by using its power over the entity. Power is demonstrated 
through existing rights that give the ability to direct 
relevant activities, those which significantly affect the 
entity’s returns. In assessing control, potential voting 
rights are considered only if the rights are substantive. 
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included 
in these consolidated financial statements from the 
date that control commences until the date that control 
ceases. For the purpose of preparing these consolidated 
financial statements, the accounting policies of 
subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to 
align them with the policies adopted by the Company.
	
Transactions eliminated on consolidation:
	
The financial statements of the Group Companies are 
consolidated on a line-by-line basis and all intra-group 
balances and transactions, and any unrealised income 
and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are 
eliminated in full while preparing these consolidated 
financial statements.
	
Functional and presentation currency:
	
These consolidated financial statements are presented 
in Indian rupees, which is the functional currency 
of the parent Company. All financial information is 
presented in rounded to the nearest lakh, except when 
otherwise indicated.
2.3 	Basis of preparation
	
These consolidated financial statements have been 
prepared under the historical cost convention on an 
accrual basis, except for certain financial instruments 
which are measured at fair value at the end of each 
reporting period. Historical cost is generally based on 
the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for 
goods and services on the transaction date. Fair value is 
the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid 
to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between 
market participants at the measurement date.
	
The consolidated financial statements have been 
prepared on going concern basis. The accounting policies 
are applied consistently to all the periods presented in the 
consolidated financial statements.
	
All the assets and liabilities have been classified as current 
or non- current as per the Group’s normal operating cycle 
and other criteria set out in Schedule III to the Companies 
Act, 2013. Based on the nature of products and time 
between the acquisition of assets for processing and their 
realization in cash or cash equivalents, the Group has 
ascertained its operating cycle as twelve months for the 
purpose of current / non- current classification of assets 
and liabilities.

2.4 	Use of estimates and judgements
	
The preparation of the consolidated financial 
statements in conformity with Ind AS requires the 
management to make estimates, judgements and 
assumptions that affect the reported balances of 
assets and liabilities (including contingent liabilities) 
as at the date of the consolidated financial statements 
and the reported income and expenses for the years 
presented. Application of accounting policies that 
require critical accounting estimates involving complex 
and subjective judgements and the use of assumptions 
in these consolidated financial statements have been 
disclosed below. Accounting estimates could change 
from period to period. Actual results could differ from 
those estimates. Appropriate changes in estimates are 
made as management becomes aware of changes in 
circumstances surrounding the estimates. Changes in 
estimates are reflected in the consolidated financial 
statements in the period in which changes are made and, 
if material, their effects are disclosed in the notes to the 
consolidated financial statements.
	
Estimates and assumptions are required in 
particular for:
	• 	Useful life and residual value of property, plant and 
equipment (PPE) and intangible assets
	
	
Useful lives of PPE and intangible assets are based 
on the life prescribed in Schedule II of the Companies 
Act, 2013. In cases, where the useful lives are different 
from that prescribed in Schedule II, they are based 
on technical advice, taking into account the nature 
of the asset, the estimated usage of the asset, the 
operating conditions of the asset, past history of 
replacement, anticipated technological changes, 
manufacturers’ warranties and maintenance support. 
Assumptions also need to be made, when the Group 
assesses, whether an asset may be capitalised and 
which components of the cost of the asset may 
be capitalised.
	•
Goodwill impairment
	
	
The Group estimates the value in use of the 
cash generating unit (CGU) based on the future 
cash flows after considering current economic 
conditions and trends, estimated future operating 
results and anticipated future economic and 
regulatory conditions.
	
	
Goodwill is tested for impairment, relying on a 
number of factors including operating results, 
business plans and future cash flows. Calculating 
the future net cash flows expected to be generated 
to determine if impairment exists and to calculate 
the impairment involves significant assumptions, 
estimation and judgment. The estimated cash flows 
are prepared using internal forecasts.
	•
Leases
	
	
Ind AS 116 requires lessees to determine the lease 
term as the non-cancellable period of a lease adjusted 
with any option to extend or terminate the lease, if the 
use of such option is reasonably certain. The Group 
makes an assessment on the expected lease term on 
a lease-by-lease basis and thereby assesses whether 
it is reasonably certain that any options to extend or 
terminate the contract will be exercised. In evaluating 
the lease term, the Group considers factors such as 
any significant leasehold improvements undertaken 
over the lease term, costs relating to the termination 
of the lease and the importance of the underlying 
asset to the Group’s operations taking into account the 
location of the underlying asset and the availability of 
suitable alternatives. The lease term in future periods 
is reassessed to ensure that the lease term reflects 
the current economic circumstances.
	•
Revenue recognition
	
	
Revenue from rendering of services is recognised 
when the obligation to render services based on 
agreements/arrangements with the customers are 
satisfied and when there are no longer any unfulfilled 
obligations. The performance obligations in our 
contracts are fulfilled at the time of delivery or upon 
formal customer acceptance depending on customer 
terms. Revenue is only recognised to the extent that it 
is highly probable a significant reversal will not occur.
	
	
The Group exercises judgement in determining 
whether the performance obligation is satisfied at 
a point in time or over a period of time. The Group 
considers indicators such as how customer consumes 
benefits as services are rendered or who controls the 
asset as it is being created or existence of enforceable 
right to payment for performance to date and alternate 
use of such product or service, transfer of significant 
risks and rewards to the customer, acceptance of 
delivery by the customer, etc.
	
	
Revenue for fixed-price contract is recognised using 
percentage-of-completion method. The Group uses 
judgement to estimate the future cost-to-completion 
of the contracts which is used to determine the degree 
of completion of the performance obligation.

Recognition and measurement of defined 
benefit obligations
	
	
The obligation arising from defined benefit plan is 
determined on the basis of actuarial assumptions. 
As actuarial valuation involves making various 
assumptions that may be different from the actual 
development in the future, key actuarial assumptions 
include discount rate, trends in salary escalation, 
attrition and mortality rate. The discount rate is 
determined by reference to market yields at the end of 
the reporting period on government bonds. The period 
to maturity of the underlying bonds correspond 
to the probable maturity of the post-employment 
benefit obligations.
	•
Valuation of taxes on income
	
	
Significant judgments are involved in determining 
the provision for income taxes, including the amount 
expected to be paid or recovered in connection with 
uncertain tax positions. Uncertain tax position is with 
regards to items of expense or transaction that may 
be challenged by tax authorities. The Group reviews 
the carrying amount of deferred tax assets at the end 
of each reporting period. The policy for the same has 
been explained under note 2.23.
	•
Provisions and contingent liabilities
	
	
Provision is recognised when the Group has a present 
obligation as a result of past event and it is probable 
that an outflow of resources will be required to settle 
the obligation, in respect of which a reliable estimate 
can be made. Provisions (excluding retirement 
obligations and compensated absences) are not 
discounted to its present value and are determined 
based on best estimate required to settle the 
obligation as at the Balance Sheet date. These are 
reviewed at each balance sheet date adjusted to 
reflect the current best estimates.
	
	
Contingent Liabilities are disclosed in respect of 
possible obligations that arise from past events, 
but their existence is confirmed by the occurrence 
or non‑occurrence of one or more uncertain future 
events not wholly within the control of the Group.
	•
Business combinations and intangible assets
	
	
Business combinations are accounted for using 
Ind AS 103, Business Combinations. Ind AS 103 
requires the identifiable intangible assets and 
contingent consideration to be fair valued in order 
to ascertain the net fair value of identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree. 
Significant estimates are required to be made in 
determining the value of contingent consideration and 
intangible assets. These valuations are conducted by 
valuation experts.
	•
Impairment of financial assets
	
	
The impairment provision for financial assets 
disclosed are based on assumptions about risk of 
default and expected loss rates. The Group uses 
judgement in making these assumptions and 
selecting the inputs to the impairment calculation, 
based on the Group’s past history, existing market 
conditions as well as forward looking estimates at 
the end of each reporting period.
	•
Share-based payments
	
	
Estimating fair value for share-based payments 
requires determination of the most appropriate 
valuation model, which is dependent on the terms and 
conditions of the grant. The estimate also requires 
determination of the most appropriate inputs to 
the valuation model including the expected life of 
the option, volatility and dividend yield and making 
assumptions about them.
2.5	 Cash flow statement
	
Cash flows are reported using the indirect method, 
whereby profit before tax is adjusted for the effects of 
transactions of non-cash nature and any deferrals or 
accruals of past or future cash receipts or payments and 
item of income or expenses associated with investing or 
financing cash flows. Cash flow from operating, investing 
and financing activities are segregated.

2.7	 Property, plant and equipment
	
Property, plant and equipment (PPE) are measured at 
cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment 
losses, if any. Amount capitalised under property, plant 
and equipment includes purchase price, duties and 
taxes, other incidental expenses incurred during the 
construction / installation stage. If significant parts 
of an item of property, plant and equipment have 
different useful lives, then they are accounted for as 
separate items (major components) of property, plant 
and equipment.
	
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised 
upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are 
expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. 
Any gain or loss on disposal of an item of property, plant 
and equipment is recognised in the statement of profit 
and loss.
2.8	 Goodwill and other intangibles assets
	
Goodwill is not amortised but it is tested for impairment 
annually or more frequently if events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired, 
and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment 
losses. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity 
include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the 
entity sold.
	
Other intangible assets are carried at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and impairment losses, if any. 
The cost of an intangible asset comprises of its purchase 
price, including any import duties and other taxes (other 
than those subsequently recoverable from the taxing 
authorities), and any directly attributable expenditure on 
making the asset ready for its intended use. Intangible 
assets arising on acquisition of business are measured 
at fair value as at date of acquisition. Subsequent 
expenditure is capitalised only if it is probable that 
the future economic benefits associated with the 
expenditure will flow to the Group. The amortisation 
expense on intangible assets with finite life is recognised 
in the statement of profit and loss under the head 
‘Depreciation and amortisation expenses’.
	
Expenditure on development eligible for capitalisation 
are carried as intangible assets under development 
where such assets are not yet ready for their intended use.
	
An intangible asset is derecognised upon disposal or 
when no future economic benefits are expected from 
its use. Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an 
intangible asset are measured as the difference between

the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of 
the asset and are recognised in the statement of profit

2.9	 Depreciation and amortisation
	
Based on internal assessment and independent 
technical evaluation carried out by external valuers 
the management believes that the useful lives as given 
below best represent the period over which management 
expects to use these assets. Hence in certain class of 
assets, the useful lives is different from the useful lives 
prescribed under Part C of Schedule II of the Companies 
Act, 2013. Depreciation and amortisation is provided 
on a straight-line basis so as to expense the cost less 
residual value over their estimated useful lives.

The estimated useful lives of PPE and intangible 
assets and the depreciation and amortisation period 
are reviewed at the end of each financial year and the 
amortisation method is revised to reflect the changed 
pattern, if any.
	
Leasehold improvements are amortised over the lease 
term or useful life of the asset, whichever is lower.
2.10	 Impairment
	
a)	 Impairment of non-financial assets
	
	
(i)	 Goodwill
	
	
	
Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual 
basis or whenever there is an indication 
that goodwill may be impaired. For goodwill 
impairment testing, the carrying amount of the 
CGUs (including allocated goodwill) is compared 
with its recoverable amount by the Group. 
The recoverable amount of a CGU is the higher 
of its fair value less cost to sell and its value-
in-use. Value-in-use is the present value of the 
future cash flows expected to be derived from the 
CGU. Total impairment loss of a CGU is allocated 
first to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill 
allocated to the CGU and then to the other assets 
of the CGU prorata on the basis of the carrying 
amount of each asset in the CGU. An impairment 
loss on goodwill is recognised in the statement 
of profit and loss and is not reversed in the 
subsequent period.
	
	
(ii) 	Other non financial assets
	
	
	
The carrying amounts of assets are reviewed at 
each balance sheet date if there is any indication 
of impairment based on internal/external factors. 
An impairment loss is recognised wherever 
the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its 
recoverable amount in the statement of profit 
and loss. An impairment loss is reversed in the 
statement of profit and loss if there has been a 
change in the estimates used to determine the 
recoverable amount. The carrying amount of 
the asset is increased to its revised recoverable 
amount, provided that this amount does not 
exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined (net of any accumulated amortisation 
or depreciation) has no impairment loss been 
recognised for the asset in the prior years. An 
asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an 
asset’s or cash generating unit’s (CGU) net selling 
price and its value in use.
	
	
	
The recoverable amount is determined for 
an individual asset, unless the asset does 
not generate cash inflows that are largely 
independent of those from other assets or groups 
of assets. Value in use is the present value of an 
asset calculated by estimating its net future 
value including the disposal value. In determining 
net selling price, recent market transactions 
are taken into account, if available. If no such 
transactions can be identified, an appropriate 
valuation model is used.
	
	
	
After impairment, depreciation is provided on 
the revised carrying amount of the asset over its 
remaining useful life.
	
b) 	 Impairment of financial asset
	
	
In accordance with Ind-AS 109, the Group applies 
Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model for measurement 
and recognition of impairment loss on the following 
financial assets and credit risk exposure: 
Integrity
Insight
Impact
180
Annual Report 2023-
	
	
i) 	 Financial assets that are measured at amortised 
cost e.g., loans, deposits, and bank balance.
	
	
ii) 	 Trade receivables.
	
	
The Group follows ‘simplified approach’ for recognition 
of impairment loss allowance on trade receivables 
which do not contain a significant financing 
component. The application of simplified approach 
does not require the Group to track changes in credit 
risk. Rather, it recognises impairment loss allowance 
based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date.
	
	
For all other financial assets, ECL is measured at an 
amount equal to the twelve month ECL unless there 
has been a significant increase in credit risk from the 
initial recognition in which case those are measured 
at lifetime ECL.
2.11	Business combinations
	
Business combinations have been accounted for using 
the acquisition method under the provisions of Ind AS 
103. The acquisition date is the date on which control is 
transferred to the acquirer. The Group measures goodwill 
as of the applicable acquisition date at the fair value of 
the consideration transferred, less the net recognised 
amount of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities 
(including contingent liabilities) acquired. 
	
When the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired 
and liabilities acquired exceeds the consideration 
transferred, a bargain purchase gain is recognised as 
capital reserve. Business combinations between entities 
under common control is accounted at carrying value.
	
Transaction cost that the Group incurs in connection 
with business combinations such as finder fees, legal 
fees and other professional and consulting fees are 
expensed as incurred.
	
Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated 
impairment loss.
2.12 	Leases
	
The Group’s lease assets consists of office premises. 
The Group assesses whether a contract contains a lease, 
at inception of a contract. A contract is, or contains, a 
lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use 
of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange 
for consideration.
	
To assess whether a contract conveys the right to 
control the use of an identified asset, the Group 
assesses whether:
	
(i) 	 the contract involves the use of an identified asset
	
(ii) 	the Group has substantially all of the economic 
benefits from use of the asset through the period of 
the lease and
	
(iii)	the Group has the right to direct the use of the asset
	
Where the Group is a lessee
	
The Group determines the lease term as the non-
cancellable period of a lease, together with periods 
covered by an option to extend the lease, where the 
Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option.
	
At the date of commencement of the lease, the Group 
recognises a right of use assets and a corresponding 
lease liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a 
lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve months 
or less (short-term leases) and leases of low value 
assets. For these short-term and leases of low value 
assets, the Group recognises the lease payments as an 
operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term 
of the lease.
	
The cost of the right of use assets measured at inception 
shall comprise of the amount of the initial measurement 
of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments 
made at or before the commencement date less any 
lease incentives received, plus any initial direct costs 
incurred and an estimate of costs to be incurred by 
the lessee in dismantling and removing the underlying 
asset or restoring the underlying asset or site on which 
it is located.
	
The right of use assets is subsequently measured at 
cost less any accumulated depreciation, accumulated 
impairment losses, if any and adjusted for any 
remeasurement of the lease liability. The right of use 
assets is depreciated using the straight-line method 
from the commencement date over the shorter of lease 
term or useful life of right of use assets. The estimated 
useful lives of right of use assets are determined on the 
same basis as those of property, plant and equipment.
	
Right of use assets are tested for impairment whenever 
there is any indication that their carrying amounts may 
not be recoverable. Impairment loss, if any, is recognised 
in the statement of profit and loss.

The Group measures the lease liability at the present 
value of the lease payments that are not paid at the 
commencement date of the lease. The lease payments 
are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the 
lease, if that rate can be readily determined. If that 
rate cannot be readily determined, the Group uses 
incremental borrowing rate.
	
The lease payments shall include fixed payments, 
variable lease payments based on an index or rate, 
residual value guarantees, exercise price of a purchase 
option where the Group is reasonably certain to exercise 
that option and payments of penalties for terminating 
the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising 
an option to terminate the lease.
	
The lease liability is subsequently remeasured by 
increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on 
the lease liability, reducing the carrying amount to 
reflect the lease payments made and remeasuring the 
carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or lease 
modifications or to reflect revised in-substance fixed 
lease payments.
	
Lease liability and right of use assets have been 
presented separately in the Balance Sheet and lease 
payments are classified as cash used in financing 
activities in the statement of cash flows.
2.13 	Share capital
	
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs 
directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options 
are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from 
the proceeds.
2.14 Fair value of financial instruments
	
In determining the fair value of the financial instruments 
the Group uses variety of methods and assumptions that 
are based on market conditions and risk existing at each 
reporting date. The method used to determine the fair 
value includes discounted cash flow analysis, available 
quoted market prices and dealer quotes. All method of 
assessing fair value results in general approximation 
of value and such value may never actually be realised. 
For all other financial instruments the carrying amounts 
approximates fair value due to short term maturity of 
those instruments.
2.15 Financial instruments
	
Initial recognition
	
The Group recognises financial assets and financial 
liabilities when it becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. All financial assets 
and liabilities are recognised at fair value on initial 
recognition, except for trade receivables which are 
initially measured at transaction price. Transaction costs 
that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue 
of financial assets and liabilities, which are not at fair 
value through profit or loss, are added to the fair value 
on initial recognition. Regular way purchase and sale of 
financial assets are accounted for at trade date.
	
Subsequent measurement
	
a) 	 Non-derivative financial instruments
	
	
(i)	 Financial assets carried at amortised cost
	
	
	
A financial asset is subsequently measured at 
amortised cost if it is held within a business 
model whose objective is to hold the asset in 
order to collect contractual cash flows and the 
contractual terms of the financial asset give 
rise on specified dates to cash flows that are 
solely payments of principal and interest on 
the principal amount outstanding. For financial 
assets maturing within one year from the 
balance sheet date, the carrying amounts 
approximate the fair value due to the short 
maturity of these instruments.
	
	
(ii) 	Financial assets at fair value through other 
comprehensive income (FVTOCI)
	
	
	
A financial asset is subsequently measured 
at FVTOCI if it is held within a business model 
whose objective is achieved by both collecting 
contractual cash flows and selling financial 
assets and the contractual terms of the financial 
asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows 
that are solely payments of principal and 
interest on the principal amount outstanding.
	
	
	
If the Group decides to classify an equity 
instrument as at FVTOCI, then all fair value 
changes on the instrument, excluding dividends, 
are recognised in the other comprehensive 
income. There is no recycling of the amounts 
from other comprehensive income to profit and 
loss, even on sale of investment. However, the 
Group may transfer the cumulative gain or loss 
within equity.
	
	
(iii)	Financial assets at fair value through profit or 
loss (FVTPL)
	
	
	
A financial asset which is not classified in any 
of the above categories are subsequently fair 
valued through profit or loss.

(iv) Financial liabilities
	
	
	
Financial liabilities are subsequently carried 
at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method, except for contingent consideration 
recognised in a business combination which is 
subsequently measured at FVTPL. For trade and 
other payables maturing within one year from 
the balance sheet date, the carrying amounts 
approximate the fair value due to the short 
maturity of these instruments.
	
b) 	 Derivative financial instruments
	
	
The Group uses derivative financial instruments 
i.e. foreign exchange forward and options contracts 
to manage its exposure to foreign exchange 
risks. Such derivative financial instruments are 
initially recognised at fair value on the date on 
which a derivative contract is entered into and 
are subsequently re-measured at fair value. 
Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the 
fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when 
the fair value is negative.
	
	
The Group uses hedging instruments that are 
governed by the policies of the Group.
	
	
(i) 	 Cash flow hedges
	
	
	
Changes in the fair value of the derivative 
hedging instrument designated as a cash flow 
hedge are recognised in other comprehensive 
income and presented within equity in the 
cash flow hedging reserve to the extent that 
the hedge is effective. To the extent that the 
hedge is ineffective, changes in fair value are 
recognised in the statement of profit and loss. 
If the hedging instrument no longer meets the 
criteria for hedge accounting, expires or is sold, 
terminated or exercised, then hedge accounting 
is discontinued prospectively. The cumulative 
gain or loss previously recognised in the cash 
flow hedging reserve is transferred to the 
statement of profit and loss upon the occurrence 
of the related forecasted transaction.
	
	
(ii)	 Receivable hedge
	
	
	
Changes in fair value of foreign currency 
derivative instruments not designated as cash 
flow hedges and the ineffective portion of cash 
flow hedges are recognised in the statement 
of profit and loss and reported within foreign 
exchange gains/(losses).
	
	
	
Derecognition of financial instruments
	
	
	
The Group derecognises a financial asset when 
the contractual rights to the cash flows from 
the financial asset expire or it transfers the 
financial asset and the transfer qualifies for 
derecognition under Ind AS 109. The changes 
in fair value of equity investments designated 
at FVTOCI are accumulated within ‘Equity 
instruments at OCI’ reserve within equity. 
The Group transfers amounts from this 
reserve to retained earnings when these equity 
instruments are derecognised. A financial 
liability (or a part of a financial liability) is 
derecognised from the Group’s Balance Sheet 
when the obligation specified in the contract is 
discharged or cancelled or expires.
2.16 	Provision, contingent liabilities and contingent 
assets:
	
A provision is recognised when the Group has a present 
obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of past 
event and it is probable that an outflow of resources 
will be required to settle the obligation, in respect 
of which reliable estimate can be made. If the effect 
of the time value of money is material, provisions 
are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that 
reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the 
liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the 
provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a 
finance costs. 
	
Contingent liabilities are disclosed in note 36. 
Contingent liabilities are disclosed for:
	
(i) 	 possible obligations which will be confirmed only 
by future events not wholly within the control of the 
Group or
	
(ii) 	 present obligations arising from past events where 
it is not probable that an outflow of resources will 
be required to settle the obligation or a reliable 
estimate of the amount of the obligation cannot 
be made.
	
Contingent assets are disclosed where an inflow of 
economic benefits is probable.
 2.17 Cash and cash equivalents
	
Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet 
comprises of cash at bank, cash on hand and short-
term investments with an original maturity of three 
months or less.

2.18 	Revenue recognition
	
Income from operations
	
Income from operations comprises income from initial 
rating and surveillance services, global research and 
risk solutions, customised research, core research 
program, customer projects and experienced 
management programs, special assignments and 
subscriptions to information products and services, 
independent equity research (IER) services, IPO 
grading services, infrastructure consulting and risk 
management services.
	•
Revenue from Initial rating fees are deemed to accrue 
on the date the rating is awarded and a portion of it 
is deferred basis an estimate that will be attributed 
to future surveillance recorded equally over 
11 months and recognise the deferred revenue over 
the estimated surveillance periods.
	•
Surveillance fee, subscription to information products 
and services, coalition business and revenue from IER 
are accounted on a time proportion basis and revenue 
is straight lined over the period of performance.
	•
Revenue from customised research and IPO grading 
services are recognised in the period in which such 
assignments are carried out in a time proportion basis. 
	•
Global research and risk solutions revenue consists 
of time and material contracts which is recognised 
on output basis measured by number of hours/days/
weeks worked at the rates specified in the agreements.
	•
Core research program revenue is recognised at a 
point in time when research report is delivered to 
the customer. 
	•
Revenue from infrastructure consulting, risk 
management services and customer projects 
and experience management program services 
are recognised in accordance with percentage 
completion method. 
	•
Percentage of completion for infrastructure 
consulting is determined based on the project cost 
incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated 
project cost required to complete the project. 
	•
Revenue from risk management services comprise of 
revenue from sale of software and annual maintenance 
contracts. Revenue from sale of software licenses 
are recognised upon delivery of these licenses which 
constitute transfer of all risks and rewards. Revenue 
from consultancy services and sale of software which 
involves customisation are recognised over execution 
period. Revenue from annual maintenance contracts 
are recognised on a time proportion basis.
	
Provision for estimated losses, if any, on uncompleted 
contracts are recorded in the year in which such losses 
become certain based on the current estimates.
	
Unbilled receivables (only where act of invoicing is 
pending) when there is unconditional right to receive 
cash, and only passage of time is required, as per 
contractual terms is classified under ‘Trade Receivables’.
	
Accrued revenue where the right to consideration is 
conditional upon factors other than the passage of 
time are contract assets which are classified as non-
financial asset as the contractual right to consideration 
is dependent on completion of contractual milestones.
	
Unearned and deferred revenue (“contract liability”) is 
recognised when there are billings in excess of revenues.
	
The billing schedules agreed with customers include 
periodic performance based payments and/or milestone 
based progress payments. Invoices are payable within 
contractually agreed credit period. Contracts are subject 
to modification to account for changes in contract 
specification and requirements. The Group reviews 
modification to contract in conjunction with the original 
contract, basis which the transaction price could be 
allocated to a new performance obligation or transaction 
price of an existing obligation could undergo a change. 
In the event transaction price is revised for existing 
obligation, a cumulative adjustment is accounted for.
2.19	Other Income
	
Grant income
	
Grants and subsidies are recognised at fair value where 
there is reasonable assurance that the grant/ subsidy 
will be received and all attaching conditions will be 
complied with.
	
Interest income
	
Interest income from a financial asset is recognised 
when it is probable that the economic benefits will 
flow to the Group and the amount of income can be 
measured reliably. Interest income is accrued on a time 
basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at 
the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate 
that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts 
through the expected life of the financial asset to that 
asset’s net carrying amount on initial recognition.
	
Dividend income
	
Dividend income is recognised when the Group’s right 
to receive payment is established by the balance 
sheet date.

Profit /(loss) on sale of current investment
	
Profit /(loss) on sale of current investment is accounted 
when the sale is executed. On disposal of such 
investments, the difference between the carrying 
amount and the disposal proceeds, net of expenses, is 
recognised in the statement of profit and loss.
 2.20	Retirement and other employee benefits
	
Short term employee benefits
	
Short-term employee benefits are expensed as the 
related service is provided. A liability is recognised 
for the amount expected to be paid if the Group has 
a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this 
amount as a result of past service provided by the 
employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
	
Defined contribution plans
	
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution 
plans are expensed as the related service is provided. 
Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to 
the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future 
payments is available.
	
Defined benefit plans 
	
The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit 
plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating 
the amount of future benefit that employees have 
earned in the current and prior periods, discounting that 
amount and deducting the fair value of any plan assets. 
The calculation of defined benefit obligations is 
performed annually by a qualified actuary using the 
projected unit credit method. When the calculation 
results in a potential asset for the Group, the recognised 
asset is limited to the present value of economic 
benefits available in the form of any future refunds 
from the plan or reductions in future contributions to 
the plan. To calculate the present value of economic 
benefits, consideration is given to any applicable 
minimum funding requirements.
	
Remeasurement of the net defined benefit liability, which 
comprise actuarial gains and losses and the return on 
plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the 
asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest), are recognised 
immediately in other comprehensive income (OCI). 
Net interest expense (income) on the net defined liability 
(asset) is computed by applying the discount rate, used 
to measure the net defined liability (asset). Net interest 
expense and other expenses related to defined benefit 
plans are recognised in the statement of profit and loss. 
When the benefits of a plan are changed or when a 
plan is curtailed, the resulting change in benefit that 
relates to past service or the gain or loss on curtailment 
is recognised immediately in the statement of profit 
and loss. The Group recognises gains and losses on 
the settlement of a defined benefit plan when the 
settlement occurs.
	
Short term compensated absences are provided 
for based on estimates. Long term compensated 
absences are provided for based on actuarial valuation. 
The actuarial valuation is done as per projected unit 
credit method. The Group presents the leave as a current 
liability in the balance sheet, to the extent it does not 
have an unconditional right to defer its settlement for 
twelve months after the reporting date. Where the Group 
has the unconditional legal and contractual right to 
defer the settlement for a period beyond twelve months, 
the same is presented as non-current liability.
	
In respect of foreign subsidiaries retirement benefits are 
governed and accrued as per local statutes and there 
are no defined benefit plan. The amount contributed 
to the defined contribution plan is charged to the 
statement of profit and loss account on accrual basis.
2.21 	Employee stock compensation cost 
	
The Group recognises expense relating to share based 
payment in net profit using fair value in accordance with 
Ind AS 102-Share Based Payment.
	
The grant date fair value of options granted to 
employees is recognised as an employee expense, with 
a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that 
the employees become unconditionally entitled to the 
options. The expense is recorded for each separately 
vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in 
substance, multiple awards. The increase in equity 
recognised in connection with share based payment 
transaction is presented as a separate component 
in equity under “Share based payment reserve”. 
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to 
reflect the actual number of stock options that vest
2.22	 Foreign currency
	
Functional currency
	
The functional currency of the Group and its Indian 
subsidiaries is the Indian Rupee (INR), whereas the 
functional currency of the foreign subsidiaries is 
mentioned in AOC-1. These consolidated financial 
statements are presented in Indian Rupees (rounded 
off to the nearest lakh except otherwise indicated).

The financial statements of subsidiary companies 
whose functional currency is the currency of a 
hyperinflationary economy are adjusted for the 
effects of changes in general price index (to reflect the 
change in purchasing power of the local currency) and 
expressed in terms of the current unit of measurement 
at the closing date of the reporting period, in accordance 
with Ind AS 29 “Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary 
Economies”. 
	
Subsidiaries with the currency of hyperinflationary 
economy as their functional currency are restated as per 
Ind AS 29 before consolidation in accordance with Ind AS 
110 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’. Once restated, 
all items of the financial statements of such a 
subsidiary is converted to INR at the closing exchange 
rate. To determine the existence of hyperinflation, the 
Group assesses the qualitative characteristics of the 
economic environment of the country such as the trend 
of inflation rate over the past three years. 
	
Foreign currency transactions
	
Foreign currency transactions are recorded at 
exchange rates prevailing on the date of transaction. 
Foreign currency denominated monetary assets and 
liabilities are restated into the functional currency using 
exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date. Gains and 
losses arising on settlement and restatement of foreign 
currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities 
are recognised in the statement of profit and loss. 
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured 
in terms of historical cost in foreign currencies are not 
translated.	
	
	
	
	
	
Foreign currency translation
	
Assets and liabilities of the entities with functional 
currency other than the presentation currency have 
been translated to the presentation currency using 
exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. 
The statement of profit and loss has been translated 
using monthly average exchange rates prevailing during 
the year. Translation adjustment have been reported as 
foreign currency translation reserve in the statement of 
changes in equity.	 	
	
	
	
2.23	 Taxes on income
	
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred 
tax. It is recognised in the statement of profit and loss 
except to the extent it relates to the items recognised 
directly in equity or in OCI.
	
Current tax
	
Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or 
receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year 
and any adjustment to the tax payable or receivable in 
respect of previous years. It is measured using tax rates 
enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. 
	
Current tax assets and liabilities are offset only if, 
the Group: 
	
a)	
has a legally enforceable right to set off the 
recognised amounts; and
	
b) 	 intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise 
the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
	
The current income tax for overseas subsidiaries has 
been computed based on the tax laws applicable to 
each subsidiary in the respective jurisdiction in which 
they operate.
	
Deferred tax
	
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary 
differences between the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the 
amounts used for taxation purposes (including those 
arising from consolidation adjustments).
	
Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax 
losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary 
differences to the extent that it is probable that future 
taxable profits will be available against which they 
can be used. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each 
reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it 
is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will 
be realised; such reductions are reversed when the 
probability of future taxable profits improves.
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they 
relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation 
authority and the relevant entity intends to settle its 
current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
2.24	 Segment reporting policies
	
The Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of 
the Group has been identified as the Chief Operating 
Decision Maker (CODM) as defined by Ind AS 108 
Operating Segments. The CODM evaluates the Group’s 
performance and allocates resources based on an 
analysis of various performance indicators by industry 
Integrity

Annual Report 2023-
classes. Accordingly, segment information has been 
presented for industry classes.
	
The Group is structured into two reportable business 
segments – 1. Ratings services 2. Research, Analytics 
and Solutions. The reportable business segments are in 
line with the segment wise information which is being 
presented to the CODM. Geographical information 
on revenue and industry revenue information is 
collated based on individual customers invoices or in 
relation to which the revenue is otherwise recognised. 
The accounting principles used in the preparation of 
the consolidated financial statements are consistently 
applied to record revenue and expenditure in individual 
segments, and are as set out in the significant policies.
	
Assets and liabilities that are directly attributable 
or allocable to segments are disclosed under each 
reportable segment. All other assets and liabilities are 
disclosed as unallocable. Property, plant and equipment 
that are used interchangeably among segments are not 
allocated to reportable segments.
	
Inter segment transfers
	
The Group generally accounts for inter segment services 
and transfers as if the services or transfers were to third 
parties at arm length price.
	
Allocation of common costs
	
Common allocable costs are allocated to each segment 
according to the relative contribution of each segment 
to the total common costs.
	
Unallocated items
	
Unallocable income and expenses includes general 
corporate income and expense items which are not 
identified to any business segment.
2.25	 Earnings per share
	
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the 
net profit or loss for the period attributable to equity 
shareholders by the weighted average number of equity 
shares outstanding during the year. The weighted 
average number of equity shares outstanding during 
the period is adjusted for events such as buy back, 
Employee Stock Option Scheme (ESOS), etc. that have 
changed the number of equity shares outstanding, 
without a corresponding change in resources.
	
For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per 
share, the Group has adopted treasury stock method to 
compute the new shares that can possibly be created 
by un-exercised stock options. The net profit or loss for 
the period attributable to equity shareholders and the 
weighted average number of shares outstanding during 
the period are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive 
potential equity shares.
2.26	 Dividend
	
The final dividend on shares is recorded as a 
liability on the date of approval by the shareholders. 
Interim dividend is recognised as a liability on the date 
of declaration by the Company’s Board of Directors.
2.27	 Recent accounting pronouncements
	
Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA), vide notification 
dated March 31, 2023, has made the following 
amendments to Ind AS which are effective April 1, 2023: 
	
a.	 Amendments to Ind AS 1, Presentation of Financial 
Statements where the companies are now required 
to disclose material accounting policies rather than 
their significant accounting policies. 
	
b. 	 Amendments to Ind AS 8, Accounting policies, 
Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors where 
the definition of ‘change in account estimate’ has 
been replaced by revised definition of ‘accounting 
estimate’. 
	
c. 	 Amendments to Ind AS 12, Income Taxes where the 
scope of Initial Recognition Exemption (IRE) has been 
narrowed down.
	
Based on preliminary assessment, the Group does 
not expect these amendments to have any significant 
impact on its consolidated financial statements.

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the Cash Generating 
Units (CGU) or groups of CGU’s, which benefit from the synergies of the acquisition. The chief operating decision maker 
reviews the goodwill for any impairment at the CGU’s level.
	
The recoverable amount of a CGU is the higher of its fair value less cost to sell and its value-in-use, both of which are 
calculated by the Group using a discounted cash flow analysis. These calculations use pre tax cash flow projections over 
a period of three years, based on financial budgets approved by the management. For calculation of the recoverable 
amount, the Group has used the following rates:

As at 
December 31, 2022
Growth rate
5.00%
5.00%
Discount rate
19.40%
16.60%
	
The above discount rate is based on the weighted average cost of capital of the Company or Group. These estimates are 
likely to differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows.
	
An analysis of sensitivity of the computation to a change in key parameters (operating margins and discount rate) based 
on reasonably probable assumptions, did not identify any probable scenario in which recoverable amount of the CGU 
would decrease below its carrying amount.
	
As at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the estimated recoverable amount of the CGU exceeded its carrying 
amount, hence impairment is not triggered.

34.1	Fair value hierarchy
	
For financial reporting purpose, fair value measurements are categorised into Level 1, 2, or 3 based on the degree to which 
the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement 
in its entirety, which are described as follows:	
	
Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
	
Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly 
(i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
	
Level 3 – Inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). 
The following table presents the fair value measurement hierarchy of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair 
value as at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

Annual Report 2023-
The Group uses foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge its exposure in foreign currency risk. Hedge is broadly 
classified as revenue hedge and receivable hedge.
Revenue hedge: For forecasted revenue transaction, the Group will adopt cash flow hedge and record mark to market 
through OCI. Effective hedge is routed through OCI in the balance sheet and the ineffective portion is immediately routed 
through the statement of profit and loss.
35.	 Financial risk management
The Group is exposed to various risks in relation to financial instruments. The Group’s financial assets and liabilities by 
category are summarised in note 34. The main types of risks are market risk (foreign currency exchange rate risk and price 
risk), business and credit risks and liquidity risk. The Group has in place a robust risk management policy with overall 
governance and oversight from the Audit Committee and Board of Directors. Risk Assessment is conducted periodically 
and the Group has a mechanism to identify, assess, mitigate and monitor various risks to key business objectives.
The policies for managing specific risk are summarised below:
35.1	Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flow of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in 
market price. Such changes may result from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, price and other 
market changes, the Group exposure to market risk is mainly due to foreign exchange rates and price risk.
	
Foreign currency exchange rate risk
Our exposure to market risk includes changes in foreign exchange rates. Exposures to currency exchange rates arise 
from the Group’s overseas sales and purchases, which are primarily denominated in US dollars (USD), EURO, and Pounds 
Sterling (GBP). As of December 31, 2023 and December  31, 2022, we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts 
to hedge the effect of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The details in respect of the outstanding 
foreign exchange forward contracts are given under note 34.2.

For the year ended December 31, 2023, every 5% increase/decrease of the respective foreign currencies compared 
to functional currency of the Group would impact operating margins by C 2,397 lakh (+/-2.72%). For the year ended 
December  31, 2022, operating margins would increase/decrease by C 2,829 lakh (+/-3.88%). Exposure to foreign currency 
exchange rate vary during the year depending upon the volume of overseas transactions. Nonetheless, the analysis above 
is considered to be representative of the Group’s exposure to currency risk.
	
Price risk
	
The risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market 
prices, whether those changes are caused by factors specific to the individual financial instrument or its issuer, or factors 
affecting all similar financial instruments traded in the market. The Group has adopted disciplined practices including 
position sizing, diversification, valuation, loss prevention, due diligence, and exit strategies in order to mitigate losses.
	
The Group is exposed price risk arising mainly from investments in mutual funds recognised at FVTPL. The details of 
such investment are given under note 8. If the prices had been higher/lower by 5% from the market prices existing as at 
reporting dates, profit would increase/decrease by C 3,890 lakh and C 2,463 lakh for the year ended December 31, 2023 
and December 31, 2022 respectively.
	
The Group is exposed price risk arising mainly from investments in quoted equity instruments recognised at FVTOCI. 
The details of such investment are given under note 8. If the equity prices had been higher/lower by 5% from the market 
prices existing as at the reporting date, OCI for the year ended December 31, 2023 would increase/decrease by C 1,248 
lakh and C 796 lakh for the year ended December 31, 2022.
35.2	Liquidity risk
	
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial 
liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. For the Group, liquidity risk arises from obligations 
on account of financial liabilities - trade payables and other financial liabilities. 
	
Liquidity risk management
	
The Group continues to maintain adequate amount of liquidity/treasury to meet strategic and growth objectives. The Group 
has ensured a balance between earning adequate returns on liquidity/treasury assets and the need to cover financial and 
business risks. Group’s treasury department is responsible for liquidity and funding as well as settlement management. 
In addition, processes and policies related to such risks are overseen by senior management. Management monitors the 
Group’s net liquidity position through rolling forecasts on the basis of expected cash flows.

35.3	Business and credit risks
	
To mitigate the risk arising from high dependence on any one business for revenues, the Group has adopted a strategy of 
diversifying in new products/services and into different business segments. To address the risk of dependence on a few 
large clients and a few sectors in the business segments, the Group has also actively sought to diversify its client base 
and industry segments.
	
Credit risk refers to risk that a counter party will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the 
Group. The Group is exposed to this risk for receivables from customers.
	
To manage credit risk, the Group periodically assesses the financial reliability of customers and other counterparties, 
taking into account the financial condition, current economic trends, analysis of historical bad debts and ageing of 
accounts receivable. Individual risk limits are set accordingly. The Group uses a provision margin to compute the expected 
credit loss allowance for trade receivables. Further, the Group doesn’t have significant credit risk exposure to any single 
counter party or a group of counter parties and have adequate provision for credit risk/bad debts. Trade receivables are 
monitored on periodic basis for any non-recoverability of the dues. Bank balances are held with only high rated banks. 
Refer note 13.4 for trade receivables aging.

Notes to segmental results:
	
*Other income which have been allocated to business segments have not been considered in determining unallocable income.
	
**Assets and liabilities used interchangeably between business segments have been classified as unallocable. The Group believes that 
it is currently not practical to allocate these assets and liabilities since a meaningful segregation of the available data is not feasible. 
#Non-current assets for the purpose of geographical segment does not include deferred tax assets, tax assets and financial instruments.

41.	 Application of Ind AS 29 in financial reporting of Argentina subsidiary
	
Ind AS 29 “Financial reporting in Hyperinflation Economies”, which requires that the financial statements of entities whose 
functional currency is that of Hyperinflation economy to be adjusted for the effects of changes in a suitable general price 
index and to be expressed in terms of the current unit of measurement at the closing rate of the reporting period, is still 
applicable for the Company’s Argentine subsidiary. The inflation adjustment was calculated by means of conversion factor 
derived from the Argentine price indexes published by the Argentina’s Official Statistics Bureau (‘INDEC’). The average 
index for the year ended December 31, 2023, was 3.00 (Previous year average index: 1.95).
	
The main procedures for the above mentioned adjustment are as follows:
	
i. 	
Monetary assets and liabilities which are carried at amounts current at the balance sheet date are not restated 
because they are already expressed in terms of the monetary unit current at the balance sheet date.
	
ii. 	
Non-monetary assets and liabilities which are not carried at amounts current at the balance sheet date, and 
components of shareholders’ equity are adjusted by applying the relevant conversion factors.
	
iii. 	 All items in the income statement are restated by applying the relevant conversion factors.
	
iv. 	
The effect of inflation on the Company’s net monetary position is included in the income statement, in finance costs, 
net, under the caption “Inflation adjustment results”.

The Board of Directors at its meeting held on February 16, 2024 have recommended a payment of final dividend of

Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition accounting method as at the date of the acquisition, 
which is the date at which control is transferred to the Group. The consideration transferred in the acquisition and the 
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognised at fair values on their acquisition date. Goodwill is 
initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred over the net identifiable

Independent Auditor’s Report
To the Members of CRISIL Limited
Report on the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Opinion
1.	
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial 
statements of CRISIL Limited (‘the Company’), which 
comprise the Balance Sheet as at 31 December 2023, 
the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other 
Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Cash Flow 
and the Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then 
ended, and notes to the standalone financial statements, 
including a summary of the significant accounting 
policies and other explanatory information, in which 
are included the returns for the year ended on that date 
audited by the branch auditors of the Company’s branch 
located at Dubai (U.A.E).
2.	
In our opinion and to the best of our information and 
according to the explanations given to us, and based on 
the consideration of the reports of the branch auditor 
as referred to in paragraph 15 below,  the aforesaid 
standalone financial statements give the information 
required by the Companies Act, 2013 (‘the Act’) in the 
manner so required and give a true and fair view in 
conformity with the  Indian Accounting Standards 
(‘Ind AS’) specified under section 133 of the Act read 
with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 
Rules, 2015 and other accounting principles generally 
accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company 
as at 31 December 2023, and its profit (including other 
comprehensive income), its cash flows and the changes 
in equity for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
3.	
We conducted our audit in accordance with the 
Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of 
the Act. Our responsibilities under those standards are 
further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the 
Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements section 
of our report. We are independent of the Company in 
accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute 
of Chartered Accountants of India (‘ICAI’) together with 
the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit 
of the financial statements under the provisions of the 
Act and the rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our 
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these 
requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the 
audit evidence we have obtained together with the audit 
evidence obtained by the branch auditor, in terms of their 
report referred to in paragraph 15 of the Other Matter 
section is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our  opinion.
Key Audit Matter
4.	
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our 
professional judgment, and based on the consideration of 
the report of the branch auditor as referred to paragraph 
15 below, were of most significance in our audit of the 
standalone financial statements of the current period. 
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit 
of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming 
our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate 
opinion on these matters.
5.	
We have determined the matter described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.

Key audit matter
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
The application of the accounting standard is complex 
and an area of focus in the audit, as it involved 
application of significant judgments and estimates 
relating to identification of distinct performance 
obligations, determination of transaction price of 
identified performance obligation, the appropriateness 
of the basis used to measure revenue recognized over 
a period. Additionally, the standard mandates robust 
disclosures in respect of revenue and periods over which 
the remaining performance obligations will be satisfied 
subsequent to the balance sheet.
Due to the significance of the item to the financial 
statements, complexities involved, and management 
judgment involved for ensuring appropriateness of 
accounting treatment, this matter has been identified as 
a key audit matter for the current year’s audit.
	•
Evaluated the appropriateness of accounting policies 
selected by the Company on the basis of our understanding 
of the Company, the nature and size of its operation, and 
the requirement of the relevant accounting standards 
under the Ind AS framework;
	•
On a sample of contracts, tested the revenue recognition 
and our procedures included:
	
-	
reviewing the contract terms and conditions;
	
-	
evaluating the identification of performance 
obligations of the contract;
	
-	
evaluating the appropriateness of management’s 
assessment of manner of satisfaction of performance 
obligations and consequent recognition of revenue; and
	
-	
evaluating the reasonableness of the estimates 
involved in the recognition of revenue including in 
determining revenue from infrastructure advisory 
and risk management services in accordance with the 
percentage of completion etc.
	•
Tested revenue recognition for cut off transactions on 
sample basis to assess whether the timing of revenue 
recognition is appropriate; and
	•
Evaluated the appropriateness and adequacy of the 
disclosures made in the accompanying standalone 
financial statements for revenue recorded during the year.
Information other than the Financial Statements 
and Auditor’s Report thereon
6.	
The Company’s Board of Directors are responsible for 
the other information. The other information comprises 
the information included in the Annual Report, but does 
not include the standalone financial statements and our 
auditor’s report thereon. 
	
Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does 
not cover the other information and we will not express 
any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
	
In connection with our audit of the standalone financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read the other 
information and, in doing so, consider whether the 
other information is materially inconsistent with the 
standalone financial statements or our knowledge 
obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially 
misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we 
conclude that there is a material misstatement of this 
other information, we are required to report that fact. We 
have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of Management and Those 
Charged with Governance for the Standalone 
Financial Statements
7.	
The accompanying standalone financial statements 
have been approved by the Company’s Board of Directors. 
The Company’s Board of Directors are responsible for 
the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with 
respect to the preparation and presentation of these 
standalone financial statements that give a true and 
fair view of the financial position, financial performance 
including other comprehensive income, changes in 
equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance 
with the Ind AS specified under section 133 of the Act 
and other accounting principles generally accepted in 
India. This responsibility also includes maintenance of 
adequate accounting records in accordance with the 
provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of 
the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds 
and other irregularities; selection and application of 
appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and 
estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, 
implementation and maintenance of adequate internal 
Financial Statements

financial controls, that were operating effectively 
for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the 
accounting records, relevant to the preparation and 
presentation of the financial statements that give a true 
and fair view and are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.
8.	
In preparing the financial statements, the Board of 
Directors are responsible for assessing the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as 
applicable, matters related to going concern and using 
the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board 
of Directors either intend to liquidate the Company or to 
cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to 
do so.
9.	
Those Board of Directors are also responsible for 
overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Standalone Financial Statements
10.	 Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due 
to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that 
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high 
level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit 
conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing will 
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
financial statements.
11.	 As part of an audit in accordance with Standards on 
Auditing, specified under section 143(10) of the Act 
we exercise professional judgment and maintain 
professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
	•
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement 
of the financial statements, whether due to fraud 
or error, design and perform audit procedures 
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence 
that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for 
one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, 
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or 
the override of internal control;
	•
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant 
to the audit in order to design audit procedures that 
are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 
143(3)(i) of the Act we are also responsible for 
expressing our opinion on whether the Company has 
adequate internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements in place and the operating 
effectiveness of such controls;
	•
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates 
and related disclosures made by management;
	•
Conclude on the appropriateness of Board of 
Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting 
and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether 
a material uncertainty exists related to events or 
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, 
we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s 
report to the related disclosures in the financial 
statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, 
to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based 
on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our 
auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions 
may cause the Company to cease to continue as a 
going concern;
	•
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and 
content of the financial statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the financial statements 
represent the underlying transactions and events in 
a manner that achieves fair presentation; and
	•
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence 
regarding the financial statements of the Company 
and its branch to express an opinion on the financial 
statements. We are responsible for the direction, 
supervision and performance of the audit of financial 
statements of the Company and such branch 
included in the financial statements, of which we 
are the independent auditors. For the other branch 
included in the financial statements, which has been 
audited by the branch auditor, such branch auditor 
remain responsible for the direction, supervision and 
performance of the audits carried out by them. We 
remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
12.	 We communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope 
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, 
including any significant deficiencies in internal control 
that we identify during our audit.
13.	 We also provide those charged with governance with 
a statement that we have complied with relevant 
Integrity

Impact
230
Annual Report 2023-
ethical requirements regarding independence, and to 
communicate with them all relationships and other 
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
14.	 From the matters communicated with those charged 
with governance, we determine those matters that 
were of most significance in the audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and are therefore 
the key audit matters. We describe these matters in 
our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes 
public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely 
rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should 
not be communicated in our report because the 
adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably 
be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of 
such communication.
Other Matter
15.	 We did not audit the financial statements of one (1) 
branch included in the standalone financial statements 
of the Company whose financial statements reflects 
total assets and net assets of C 887 lakh and C 459 
lakh respectively as at 31 December 2023, and the 
total revenues of C 1,535 lakh, total net loss after tax of 
C 354 lakh, total comprehensive loss of C 329 lakh, and 
cash outflows (net) of C 161 lakh respectively for the year 
ended on that date, as considered in the standalone 
financial statements. These financial statements have 
been audited by the branch auditor whose report has 
been furnished to us by the management, and our 
opinion on the standalone financial statements, in so far 
as it relates to the amounts and disclosures included in 
respect of the branch, and our report in terms of sub-
section (3) of section 143 of the Act in so far as it relates 
to the aforesaid branch, is based solely on the report of 
such branch auditor.
	
Further, this one branch is located outside India whose 
financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with accounting principles generally accepted in 
that country and which has been audited by branch 
auditor under generally accepted auditing standards 
applicable in that country. The Company’s management 
has converted the financial statements of such branch 
from accounting principles generally accepted in that 
country to accounting principles generally accepted in 
India. We have audited these conversion adjustments 
made by the Company’s management. Our opinion on the 
standalone financial statements, in so far as it relates to 
the amounts and disclosures included in respect of such 
branch, is based on the report of branch auditor and the 
conversion adjustments prepared by the management 
of the Company and audited by us.
	
Our opinion above on the standalone financial 
statements, and our report on other legal and regulatory 
requirements below, are not modified in respect of the 
above matters with respect to our reliance on the work 
done by and the report of the branch auditor.

Annexure II
Annexure II to the Independent Auditor’s Report of even date to the members of CRISIL Limited on 
the standalone financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023
Independent Auditor’s Report on the internal 
financial controls with reference to the 
standalone financial statements under Clause (i) 
of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies 
Act, 2013 (‘the Act’) 
1.	
In conjunction with our audit of the standalone financial 
statements of CRISIL Limited (‘the Company’) as at and 
for the year ended 31 December 2023, we have audited 
the internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements of the Company as at that date. 
Responsibilities of Management and Those 
Charged with Governance for Internal Financial 
Controls
2.	
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for 
establishing and maintaining internal financial controls 
with reference to standalone financial statements 
based on the internal control over financial reporting 
criteria established by the Company considering the 
essential components of internal control stated in the 
Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls 
over Financial Reporting (‘Guidance Note’) issued by 
the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (‘ICAI’). 
These responsibilities include the design, implementation 
and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls 
that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly 
and efficient conduct of the Company’s business, 
including adherence to the Company’s policies, the 
safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection 
of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of 
the accounting records, and the timely preparation of 
reliable financial information, as required under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the 
Internal Financial Controls with Reference to 
Financial Statements 
3.	
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the 
Company’s internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements based on our audit. We conducted 
our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing 
issued by the ICAI prescribed under Section 143(10) 
of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of 
internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements, and the Guidance Note issued by the 
ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require 
that we comply with ethical requirements and plan 
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether adequate internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements were established and 
maintained and if such controls operated effectively in 
all material respects.
4.	
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements and 
their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements 
includes obtaining an understanding of such internal 
financial controls, assessing the risk that a material 
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design 
and operating effectiveness of internal control based 
on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend 
on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment 
of the risks of material misstatement of the financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error.
5.	
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with 
Reference to Financial Statements 
6.	
A company’s internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements is a process designed to 
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability 
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial 
statements for external purposes in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s 
internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements include those policies and procedures 
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, 
in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect 
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of 
the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that 
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit 
preparation of financial statements in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles, and 
that receipts and expenditures of the company are 
being made only in accordance with authorisations 
Integrity

Annual Report 2023-
of management and directors of the company; and (3) 
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or 
timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or 
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a 
material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial 
Controls with Reference to Financial Statements 
7.	
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements, including 
the possibility of collusion or improper management 
override of controls, material misstatements due to error 
or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections 
of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements to future periods are 
subject to the risk that the internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements may become 
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that 
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures 
may deteriorate.
Opinion
8.	
In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, 
adequate internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements and such controls were operating 
effectively as at 31 December 2023, based on the 
criteria for internal financial controls with reference 
to standalone financial statements established by 
the Company considering the essential components 
of internal control stated in Guidance Note issued by 
the ICAI.

Summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information to the 
standalone financial statements as at and for the year ended December 31, 2023
1. 	 Corporate Information
	
 CRISIL Limited (“the Company” or “CRISIL”) [CIN:

	
S&P Global Inc. the ultimate holding Company, through 
its subsidiaries owned 66.65% as on December 31, 2023 
of the Company’s equity share capital (refer to note 19).
	
These standalone financial statements for the year 
ended December 31, 2023 were approved by the Board 
of Directors on February 16, 2024.	
2.	 Summary of significant accounting policies
2.1	 Statement of compliance
	
These standalone financial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with the Indian Accounting 
Standards (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Ind AS’) as 
notified by Ministry of Corporate Affairs pursuant to 
Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with Rule 
3 of the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 
2015 as amended from time to time. 
	
Functional and presentation currency		
	
	
These standalone financial statements are presented 
in Indian rupees, which is the functional currency of the 
Company. All financial information is rounded to the 
nearest lakh, except when otherwise indicated.	 	
2.2	 Basis of preparation
	
These standalone financial statements have been 
prepared under the historical cost convention on an 
accrual basis, except for certain financial instruments 
which are measured at fair value at the end of each 
reporting period. Historical cost is generally based on 
the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for 
goods and services on the transaction date. Fair value is 
the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid 
to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between 
market participants at the measurement date.
	
The standalone financial statements have been prepared 
on going concern basis. The accounting policies are 
applied consistently to all the periods presented in the 
standalone financial statements.
	
All the assets and liabilities have been classified 
as current or non- current as per the Company’s 
normal operating cycle and other criteria as set out in 
Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013. Based on the 
nature of products and time between the acquisition of 
assets for processing and their realisation in cash or cash 
equivalents, the Company has ascertained its operating 
cycle as twelve months for the purpose of current / non- 
current classification of assets and liabilities.
2.3 	Use of estimates and judgements
	
The preparation of the standalone financial statements 
in conformity with Ind AS requires the management to 
make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect 
the reported balances of assets and liabilities (including 
contingent liabilities) as at the date of the financial 
statements and the reported income and expenses for 
the years presented. Application of accounting policies 
that require critical accounting estimates involving 
complex and subjective judgments and the use of 
assumptions in these standalone financial statements 
have been disclosed below. Accounting estimates could 
change from period to period. Actual results could 
differ from those estimates. Appropriate changes in 
estimates are made as management becomes aware of 
changes in circumstances surrounding the estimates. 
Changes in estimates are reflected in the standalone 
financial statements in the period in which changes are 
made and, if material, their effects are disclosed in the 
notes to the standalone financial statements. 
	
Estimates and assumptions are required in 
particular for:
	•
Useful life and residual value of property, plant and 
equipment (PPE) and intangible assets
	
	
Useful lives of PPE and intangible assets are 
based on the life prescribed in Schedule II of 
the Companies Act, 2013. In cases, where the 
useful lives are different from that prescribed in 
Schedule II, they are based on technical advice, taking 
Integrity

into account the nature of the asset, the estimated 
usage of the asset, the operating conditions of the 
asset, past history of replacement, anticipated 
technological changes, manufacturers’ warranties 
and maintenance support. Assumptions also need to 
be made, when it is assessed, whether an asset may 
be capitalised and which components of the cost of 
the asset may be capitalised.
	•
Goodwill impairment
	
	
The Company estimates the value in use of the 
cash generating unit (CGU) based on the future 
cash flows after considering current economic 
conditions and trends, estimated future operating 
results and anticipated future economic and 
regulatory conditions.
	
	
Goodwill is tested for impairment, relying on a number 
of factors including operating results, business plans 
and future cash flows. Calculating the future net 
cash flows expected to be generated to determine if 
impairment exists and to calculate the impairment 
involves significant assumptions, estimation and 
judgment. The estimated cash flows are prepared 
using internal forecasts.
	•
Leases
	
	
Ind AS 116 requires lessees to determine the lease 
term as the non-cancellable period of a lease 
adjusted with any option to extend or terminate 
the lease, if the use of such option is reasonably 
certain. The Company makes an assessment on the 
expected lease term on a lease-by-lease basis and 
thereby assesses whether it is reasonably certain 
that any options to extend or terminate the contract 
will be exercised. In evaluating the lease term, the 
Company considers factors such as any significant 
leasehold improvements undertaken over the lease 
term, costs relating to the termination of the lease 
and the importance of the underlying asset to the 
Company’s operations taking into account the 
location of the underlying asset and the availability 
of suitable alternatives. The lease term in future 
periods is reassessed to ensure that the lease term 
reflects the current economic circumstances.
	•
Revenue recognition
	
	
Revenue from rendering of services is recognised 
when the obligation to render services based on 
agreements/arrangements with the customers are 
satisfied and when there are no longer any unfulfilled 
obligations. The performance obligations in our 
contracts are fulfilled at the time of delivery or upon 
formal customer acceptance depending on customer 
terms. Revenue is recognised only to the extent that it 
is highly probable a significant reversal will not occur.
	
	
The Company exercises judgement in determining 
whether the performance obligation is satisfied at a 
point in time or over a period of time. The Company 
considers indicators such as how customer 
consumes benefits as services are rendered or who 
controls the asset as it is being created or existence of 
enforceable right to payment for performance to date 
and alternate use of such product or service, transfer 
of significant risks and rewards to the customer, 
acceptance of delivery by the customer, etc.
	
	
Revenue for fixed-price contract is recognised using 
percentage-of-completion method. The Company 
uses judgement to estimate the future cost-
to-completion of the contracts which is used 
to determine the degree of completion of the 
performance obligation.
	•
Recognition and measurement of defined 
benefit obligations
	
	
The obligation arising from defined benefit plan is 
determined on the basis of actuarial assumptions. 
As actuarial valuation involves making various 
assumptions that may be different from the actual 
development in the future, key actuarial assumptions 
include discount rate, trends in salary escalation, 
attrition and mortality rate. The discount rate is 
determined by reference to market yields at the 
end of the reporting period on government bonds. 
The period to maturity of the underlying bonds 
correspond to the probable maturity of the post-
employment benefit obligations.
	•
Valuation of taxes on income
	
	
Significant judgments are involved in determining 
the provision for income taxes, including the amount 
expected to be paid or recovered in connection with 
uncertain tax positions. Uncertain tax position is 
with regards to items of expense or transaction that 
may be challenged by tax authorities. The Company 
reviews the carrying amount of deferred tax assets 
at the end of each reporting period. The policy for the 
same has been explained under note 2.18.
	•
Provisions and contingent liabilities
	
	
Provision is recognised when the Company has a 
present obligation as a result of past event and 
it is probable that an outflow of resources will be 
required to settle the obligation, in respect of which a 
reliable estimate can be made. Provisions (excluding 
retirement obligations and compensated absences) 
are not discounted to its present value and are

determined based on best estimate required to 
settle the obligation as at the Balance Sheet date. 
These are reviewed at each balance sheet date 
adjusted to reflect the current best estimates.
	
	
Contingent Liabilities are disclosed in respect of 
possible obligations that arise from past events, but 
their existence is confirmed by the occurrence or non-
occurrence of one or more uncertain future events 
not wholly within the control of the Company.	
	•
Business combinations and intangible assets
	
	
Business combinations are accounted for using 
Ind AS 103, Business Combinations. Ind AS 103 
requires the identifiable intangible assets and 
contingent consideration to be fair valued in order 
to ascertain the net fair value of identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree. 
Significant estimates are required to be made in 
determining the value of contingent consideration 
and intangible assets. These valuations are 
conducted by valuation experts.
	•
Provision for expected credit loss of financial 
assets
	
	
The impairment provision for financial assets 
disclosed are based on assumptions about risk 
of default and expected loss rates. The Company 
uses judgement in making these assumptions and 
selecting the inputs to the impairment calculation, 
based on the Company’s past history, existing market 
conditions as well as forward looking estimates at 
the end of each reporting period.
	•
Share-based payments
	
	
Estimating fair value for share-based payments 
requires determination of the most appropriate 
valuation model, which is dependent on the terms 
and conditions of the grant. The estimate also 
requires determination of the most appropriate 
inputs to the valuation model including the expected 
life of the option, volatility and dividend yield and 
making assumptions about them.

Property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any. 
Amount capitalised under property, plant and equipment 
includes purchase price, duties and taxes, other 
incidental expenses incurred during the construction 
/ installation stage. If significant parts of an item of 
property, plant and equipment have different useful 
lives, then they are accounted for as separate items 
(major components) of property, plant and equipment.
	
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised 
upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are 
expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. 
Any gain or loss on disposal of an item of property, plant 
and equipment is recognised in the statement of profit 
and loss.
2.5 	Goodwill and other intangibles assets
	
Goodwill is not amortised but it is tested for impairment 
annually or more frequently if events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired, 
and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment 
losses. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity 
include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the 
entity sold.
	
Other intangible assets are carried at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and impairment losses, if 
any. The cost of an intangible asset comprises of its 
purchase price, including any import duties and other 
taxes (other than those subsequently recoverable from 
the taxing authorities), and any directly attributable 
expenditure on making the asset ready for its intended 
use. Intangible assets arising on acquisition of business 
are measured at fair value as at date of acquisition. 
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only if it is 
probable that the future economic benefits associated 
with the expenditure will flow to the Company. 
The amortisation expense on intangible assets with 
finite life is recognised in the statement of profit and 
loss under the head ‘Depreciation and amortisation 
expenses’.	
	
Expenditure on development eligible for capitalisation are 
carried as intangible assets under development where 
such assets are not yet ready for their intended use.	
	
An intangible asset is derecognised upon disposal or 
when no future economic benefits are expected from 
its use. Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an 
intangible asset are measured as the difference between 
the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of 
the asset and are recognised in the statement of profit 
and loss when the asset is derecognised.
2.6	 Depreciation and amortisation
	
Based on internal assessment and independent 
technical evaluation carried out by external valuers 
the management believes that the useful lives as given 
below best represent the period over which management 
expects to use these assets. Hence in certain class of 
assets, the useful lives is different from the useful lives

The estimated useful lives of PPE and intangible assets 
as well as the depreciation and amortisation period 
are reviewed at the end of each financial year and the 
depreciation and amortisation method is revised to 
reflect the changed pattern, if any.
	
Leasehold improvements are amortised over the lease 
term or useful life of the asset, whichever is lower.
2.7	 Impairment
	
a)	 Impairment of non-financial assets
	
	
The carrying amounts of assets are reviewed at 
each balance sheet date if there is any indication 
of impairment based on internal/external factors. 
An impairment loss is recognised wherever the 
carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable 
amount in the statement of profit and loss. 
An impairment loss is reversed in the statement 
of profit and loss if there has been a change in the 
estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. 
The carrying amount of the asset is increased to 
its revised recoverable amount, provided that this 
amount does not exceed the carrying amount that 
would have been determined (net of any accumulated 
amortisation or depreciation) has no impairment 
loss been recognised for the asset in the prior years. 
An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an 
asset’s or cash generating unit’s (CGU) net selling 
price and its value in use.
	
	
The recoverable amount is determined for an 
individual asset, unless the asset does not generate 
cash inflows that are largely independent of those 
from other assets or groups of assets. Value in 
use is the present value of an asset calculated by 
estimating its net future value including the disposal 
value. In determining net selling price, recent market 
transactions are taken into account, if available. If no 
such transactions can be identified, an appropriate 
valuation model is used.
	
	
After impairment, depreciation is provided on 
the revised carrying amount of the asset over its 
remaining useful life.
	
b) 	 Impairment of financial asset
	
	
In accordance with Ind-AS 109, the Company applies 
Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model for measurement 
and recognition of impairment loss on the following 
financial assets and credit risk exposure:
	
	
i)	
Financial assets that are measured at amortised 
cost e.g., loans, deposits, and bank balances.
	
	
ii)	 Trade receivables.
	
	
	
The Company follows ‘simplified approach’ 
for recognition of impairment loss allowance 
on trade receivables which do not contain 
a significant financing component. The 
application of simplified approach does not require 
the Company to track changes in credit risk. 
Rather, it recognises impairment loss allowance 
based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date.
	
	
	
For all other financial assets, ECL is measured at 
an amount equal to the twelve month ECL unless 
there has been a significant increase in credit risk 
from the initial recognition in which case those 
are measured at lifetime ECL.
2.8	 Leases
	
The Company’s lease assets consists of office premises. 
The Company assesses whether a contract contains a 
lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or contains, 
a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use 
of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for 
consideration.	
	
To assess whether a contract conveys the right to 
control the use of an identified asset, the Company 
assesses whether:
	
(i) 	
the contract involves the use of an identified asset
	
(ii) 	 the Company has substantially all of the economic 
benefits from use of the asset through the period of 
the lease and

(iii) 	 the Company has the right to direct the use of 
the asset	
	
Where the Company is a lessee
	
The Company determines the lease term as the non-
cancellable period of a lease, together with periods 
covered by an option to extend the lease, where the 
Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option.
	
At the date of commencement of the lease, the Company 
recognises a right of use assets and a corresponding 
lease liability measured at the present value of lease 
payments to be made over the lease term for all lease 
arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases 
with a term of twelve months or less (short-term leases) 
and leases of low value assets. For these short-term and 
leases of low value assets, the Company recognises the 
lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-
line basis over the term of the lease.
	
The cost of the right of use assets measured at inception 
shall comprise of the amount of the initial measurement 
of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments 
made at or before the commencement date less any 
lease incentives received, plus any initial direct costs 
incurred and an estimate of costs to be incurred by 
the lessee in dismantling and removing the underlying 
asset or restoring the underlying asset or site on which 
it is located.	
	
The right of use assets is subsequently measured at 
cost less any accumulated depreciation, accumulated 
impairment losses, if any and adjusted for any 
remeasurement of the lease liability. The right of use 
assets is depreciated using the straight-line method 
from the commencement date over the shorter of lease 
term or useful life of right of use assets. The estimated 
useful lives of right of use assets are determined on the 
same basis as those of property, plant and equipment.
	
Right of use assets are tested for impairment whenever 
there is any indication that their carrying amounts may 
not be recoverable. Impairment loss, if any, is recognised 
in the statement of profit and loss.
	
The Company measures the lease liability at the present 
value of the lease payments that are not paid at the 
commencement date of the lease. The lease payments 
are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the 
lease, if that rate can be readily determined. If that 
rate cannot be readily determined, the Company uses 
incremental borrowing rate.
	
The lease payments shall include fixed payments, 
variable lease payments based on an index or rate, 
residual value guarantees, exercise price of a purchase 
option where the Company is reasonably certain to 
exercise that option and payments of penalties for 
terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the 
lessee exercising an option to terminate the lease.
	
The lease liability is subsequently remeasured by 
increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on 
the lease liability, reducing the carrying amount to 
reflect the lease payments made and remeasuring the 
carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or lease 
modifications or to reflect revised in-substance fixed 
lease payments.
	
Lease liability and right of use assets have been 
presented separately in the Balance Sheet and lease 
payments are classified as cash used in financing 
activities in the statement of cash flows.
2.9 	Share capital
	
Ordinary shares are classified as equity, incremental 
costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or 
options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, 
from proceeds.
2.10 	Fair value of financial instruments
	
In determining the fair value of the financial instruments 
the Company uses variety of methods and assumptions 
that are based on market conditions and risk existing 
at each reporting date. The method used to determine 
the fair value includes discounted cash flow analysis, 
available quoted market prices and dealer quotes. 
All method of accessing fair value results in general 
approximation of value and such value may never 
actually be realised. For all other financial instruments 
the carrying amounts approximates fair value due to 
short term maturity of those instruments.
2.11 Financial instruments
	
Initial recognition
	
The Company recognises financial assets and financial 
liabilities when it becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. All financial assets 
and liabilities are recognised at fair value on initial 
recognition, except for trade receivables which are 
initially measured at transaction price. Transaction costs 
that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue 
of financial assets and liabilities, which are not at fair 
value through profit or loss, are added to the fair value

on initial recognition. Regular way purchase and sale of 
financial assets are accounted for at trade date.
	
Subsequent measurement
	
a) 	 Non-derivative financial instruments
	
	
(i) 	 Financial assets carried at amortised cost
	
	
	
A financial asset is subsequently measured at 
amortised cost if it is held within a business 
model whose objective is to hold the asset in 
order to collect contractual cash flows and the 
contractual terms of the financial asset give 
rise on specified dates to cash flows that are 
solely payments of principal and interest on 
the principal amount outstanding. For financial 
assets maturing within one year from the balance 
sheet date, the carrying amounts approximate 
the fair value due to the short maturity of 
these instruments
	
	
(ii)	 Financial assets at fair value through other 
comprehensive income (FVTOCI)
	
	
	
A financial asset is subsequently measured 
at FVTOCI if it is held within a business model 
whose objective is achieved by both collecting 
contractual cash flows and selling financial 
assets and the contractual terms of the financial 
asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows 
that are solely payments of principal and interest 
on the principal amount outstanding.
	
	
	
If the Company decides to classify an equity 
instrument as at FVOCI, then all fair value 
changes on the instrument, excluding dividends, 
are recognised in the OCI. There is no recycling of 
the amounts from OCI to profit and loss, even on 
sale of investment. However, the Company may 
transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity.
	
	
(iii)	 Financial assets at fair value through profit or 
loss (FVTPL)
	
	
	
A financial asset which is not classified in any 
of the above categories are subsequently fair 
valued through profit or loss.
	
	
(iv)	 Financial liabilities
	
	
	
Financial liabilities are subsequently carried 
at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method, except for contingent consideration 
recognised in a business combination which is 
subsequently measured at FVTPL. For trade and 
other payables maturing within one year from 
the balance sheet date, the carrying amounts 
approximate the fair value due to the short 
maturity of these instruments.
	
b) 	 Derivative financial instruments
	
	
The Company uses derivative financial instruments 
i.e. foreign exchange forward and options contracts 
to manage its exposure to foreign exchange risks. 
Such derivative financial instruments are initially 
recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative 
contract is entered into and are subsequently re-
measured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as 
financial assets when the fair value is positive and 
as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative. 
The Company uses hedging instruments that are 
governed by the policies of the Company.
	
	
(i) 	 Cash flow hedges
	
	
	
Changes in the fair value of the derivative 
hedging instrument designated as a cash flow 
hedge are recognised in other comprehensive 
income and presented within equity in the 
cash flow hedging reserve to the extent that 
the hedge is effective. To the extent that the 
hedge is ineffective, changes in fair value are 
recognised in the statement of profit and loss. 
If the hedging instrument no longer meets the 
criteria for hedge accounting, expires or is sold, 
terminated or exercised, then hedge accounting 
is discontinued prospectively. The cumulative 
gain or loss previously recognised in the cash 
flow hedging reserve is transferred to the 
statement of profit and loss upon the occurrence 
of the related forecasted transaction.
	
	
(ii)	 Receivable hedge
	
	
	
Changes in fair value of foreign currency 
derivative instruments not designated as cash 
flow hedges and the ineffective portion of cash 
flow hedges are recognised in the statement 
of profit and loss and reported within foreign 
exchange gains/(losses).
	
	
Derecognition of financial instruments
	
	
The Company derecognises a financial asset when 
the contractual rights to the cash flows from the 
financial asset expire or it transfers the financial 
asset and the transfer qualifies for derecognition 
under Ind AS 109. The changes in fair value of equity 
investments designated at FVTOCI are accumulated 
within ‘Equity instruments at OCI’ reserve within

equity. The Company transfers amounts from 
this reserve to retained earnings if these equity 
instruments are derecognised. A financial liability 
(or a part of a financial liability) is derecognised from 
the Balance Sheet when the obligation specified in 
the contract is discharged or cancelled or expires.
2.12 	Provision, contingent liabilities and contingent 
assets:
	
A provision is recognised when the Company has a 
present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result 
of past event and it is probable that an outflow of 
resources will be required to settle the obligation, 
in respect of which reliable estimate can be made. 
If the effect of the time value of money is material, 
provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate 
that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the 
liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the 
provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a 
finance costs.
	
Contingent liabilities are disclosed for:
	
(i)	 possible obligations which will be confirmed only 
by future events not wholly within the control of the 
Company or 
	
(ii)	 present obligations arising from past events where 
it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be 
required to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate 
of the amount of the obligation cannot be made. 
	
	
Contingent assets are disclosed wherein an inflow of 
economic benefits is probable.
2.13 	Cash and cash equivalents
	
Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise 
cash at bank and in hand and short-term investments 
with an original maturity of three months or less.
2.14 	Revenue recognition
	
Income from operations
	
Income from operations comprises income from global 
research and risk solutions, customised research, special 
assignments and subscriptions to information products 
and services, independent equity research (IER) services, 
IPO grading services, infrastructure consulting and risk 
management services.
	•
Subscription to information products and services 
and revenue from IER are accounted on a time 
proportion basis and revenue is straight lined over 
the period of performance.
	•
Revenue from customised research and IPO grading 
are recognised in the period in which such assignments 
are carried out in a time proportion basis. 
	•
Global research and risk solutions revenue consists 
of time and material contracts which is recognised 
on output basis measured by number of hours/days/
weeks worked at the rates specified in the agreements.
	•
Revenue from infrastructure consulting, risk 
management services and customer projects 
and experience management program services 
are recognised in accordance with percentage 
completion method.
	•
Percentage of completion for infrastructure 
consulting is determined based on the project cost 
incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated 
project cost required to complete the project.	
	•
Revenue from risk management services comprise of 
revenue from sale of software and annual maintenance 
contracts. Revenue from sale of software licenses 
are recognised upon delivery of these licenses which 
constitute transfer of all risks and rewards. Revenue 
from consultancy services and sale of software which 
involves customisation are recognised over execution 
period. Revenue from annual maintenance contracts 
are recognised on a time proportion basis.
	
Provision for estimated losses, if any, on uncompleted 
contracts are recorded in the year in which such losses 
become certain based on the current estimates.
	
Revenue from group companies is recognised based on 
transaction price which is at arm’s length.
	
Unbilled receivables (only where act of invoicing is 
pending) when there is unconditional right to receive 
cash, and only passage of time is required, as per 
contractual terms is classified under ‘Trade Receivables’.
	
Accrued revenue where the right to consideration is 
conditional upon factors other than the passage of 
time are contract assets which are classified as non-
financial asset as the contractual right to consideration 
is dependent on completion of contractual milestones.
	
Unearned and deferred revenue (“contract liability”) is 
recognised when there are billings in excess of revenues.
Integrity

252
Annual Report 2023-
	
The billing schedules agreed with customers include 
periodic performance based payments and/or milestone 
based progress payments. Invoices are payable within 
contractually agreed credit period. Contracts are subject 
to modification to account for changes in contract 
specification and requirements. The Company reviews 
modification to contract in conjunction with the original 
contract, basis which the transaction price could be 
allocated to a new performance obligation or transaction 
price of an existing obligation could undergo a change. 
In the event transaction price is revised for existing 
obligation, a cumulative adjustment is accounted for.
2.15 	Other Income
	
Interest income
	
Interest income from a financial asset is recognised 
when it is probable that the economic benefits will 
flow to the Company and the amount of income can be 
measured reliably. Interest income is accrued on a time 
basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at 
the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate 
that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts 
through the expected life of the financial asset to that 
asset’s net carrying amount on initial recognition.
	
Dividend income
	
Dividend Income is recognised when the Company’s 
right to receive payment is established by the balance 
sheet date.
	
Profit /(loss) on sale of current investment
	
Profit /(loss) on sale of current investment is accounted 
when the sale is executed. On disposal of such 
investments, the difference between the carrying 
amount and the disposal proceeds, net of expenses, is 
recognised in the statement of profit and loss.
2.16 	Retirement and other employee benefits
	
Short term employee benefits
	
Short-term employee benefits are expensed as the 
related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the 
amount expected to be paid if the Company has a present 
legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a 
result of past service provided by the employee and the 
obligation can be estimated reliably
	
Defined benefit plans 
	
The Company’s net obligation in respect of defined 
benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan by 
estimating the amount of future benefit that employees 
have earned in the current and prior periods, discounting 
that amount and deducting the fair value of any 
plan assets.
	
The calculation of defined benefit obligations is 
performed annually by a qualified actuary using the 
projected unit credit method. When the calculation 
results in a potential asset for the Company, the 
recognised asset is limited to the present value 
of economic benefits available in the form of any 
future refunds from the plan or reductions in future 
contributions to the plan. To calculate the present value 
of economic benefits, consideration is given to any 
applicable minimum funding requirements.
	
Remeasurement of the net defined benefit liability, which 
comprise actuarial gains and losses and the return on 
plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the 
asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest), are recognised 
immediately in OCI. Net interest expense (income) on the 
net defined liability (assets) is computed by applying the 
discount rate, used to measure the net defined liability 
(asset). Net interest expense and other expenses related 
to defined benefit plans are recognised in the statement 
of profit and loss.
	
When the benefits of a plan are changed or when a 
plan is curtailed, the resulting change in benefit that 
relates to past service or the gain or loss on curtailment 
is recognised immediately in the statement of profit 
and loss. The Company recognises gains and losses 
on the settlement of a defined benefit plan when the 
settlement occurs.
	
Short term compensated absences are provided 
for based on estimates. Long term compensated 
absences are provided for based on actuarial valuation. 
The actuarial valuation is done as per projected unit 
credit method. The Company presents the leave as a 
current liability in the balance sheet, to the extent it does 
not have an unconditional right to defer its settlement for 
12 months after the reporting date. Where the Company 
has the unconditional legal and contractual right to 
defer the settlement for a period beyond 12 months, the 
same is presented as non-current liability.
	
Defined contribution plans
	
Retirement benefits in the form of provident fund is a 
defined contribution plan and is charge to the statement 
of profit and loss for each period of service rendered 
by the employees. Excess or short of contribution 
is recognised as an asset or liability in the financial 
statement. There are no other obligations other than the 
contribution payable to the respective authorities.

Employee stock compensation cost
	
The Company recognises expense relating to share based 
payment in net profit using fair value in accordance with 
Ind AS 102-Share Based Payment. 
	
The grant date fair value of options granted to 
employees is recognised as an employee expense, with 
a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that 
the employees become unconditionally entitled to the 
options. The expense is recorded for each separately 
vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in 
substance, multiple awards. The increase in equity 
recognised in connection with share based payment 
transaction is presented as a separate component in 
equity under “share-based payment reserve”. The amount 
recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the 
actual number of stock options that vest.
2.17	Foreign currency transactions
	
Foreign currency transactions are recorded at 
exchange rates prevailing on the date of transaction. 
Foreign currency denominated monetary assets and 
liabilities are restated into the functional currency using 
exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date. Gains and 
losses arising on settlement and restatement of foreign 
currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities 
are recognised in the statement of profit and loss. 
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured 
in terms of historical cost in foreign currencies are 
not translated.
2.18	Taxes on income
	
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. 
It is recognised in the statement of profit and loss except 
to the extent that it relates items recognised directly in 
equity or in OCI.
	
Current tax
	
Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or 
receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year 
and any adjustment to the tax payable or receivable 
in respect of previous years. It is measured using tax 
rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting 
date. Management periodically evaluates positions 
taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which 
applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretations 
and establishes provisions where appropriate.
	
Current tax assets and liabilities are offset only if, 
the Company:
	
a)	 has a legally enforceable right to set off the 
recognised amounts; and
	
b) 	 intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise 
the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
	
Deferred tax
	
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary 
differences between the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the 
amounts used for taxation purposes.
	
Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax 
losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary 
differences to the extent that it is probable that future 
taxable profits will be available against which they can be 
used. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting 
date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that the related tax benefit will be realised; 
such reductions are reversed when the probability of 
future taxable profits improves.
	
Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at 
each reporting date and recognised to the extent that it 
has become probable that future taxable profits will be 
available against which they can be used. Deferred tax is 
measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied 
to temporary differences when they reverse, using tax 
rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting 
date. The measurement of deferred tax reflects the 
tax consequences that would follow from the manner 
in which the Company expects, at the reporting date, 
to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets 
and liabilities.
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only if:
	
a) 	
The Company has a legally enforceable right to 
set off current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities; and
	
b) 	
The deferred tax assets and the deferred tax 
liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same 
taxation authority on the same taxable entity.

2.19	Earnings per share
	
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the 
net profit or loss for the period attributable to equity 
shareholders by the weighted average number of equity 
shares outstanding during the year. The weighted 
average number of equity shares outstanding during the 
period is adjusted for events such as buy back, Employee 
Stock Option Scheme (ESOS), etc. that have changed 
the number of equity shares outstanding, without a 
corresponding change in resources.
	
For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per 
share, the Company has adopted treasury stock method 
to compute the new shares that can possibly be created 
by un-exercised stock options. The net profit or loss for 
the period attributable to equity shareholders and the 
weighted average number of shares outstanding during 
the period are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive 
potential equity shares.
2.20	Dividend
	
The final dividend on shares is recorded as a liability on 
the date of approval by the shareholders. Interim dividend 
is recognised as a liability on the date of declaration by 
the Company’s Board of Directors.
2.21	Cash flow statement
	
Cash flows are reported using the indirect method, 
whereby profit before tax is adjusted for the effects of 
transactions of non-cash nature and any deferrals or 
accruals of past or future cash receipts or payments and 
item of income or expenses associated with investing or 
financing cash flows. Cash flow from operating, investing 
and financing activities are segregated.

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the CGU, which benefit 
from the synergies of the acquisition. The chief operating decision maker reviews the goodwill for any impairment at the 
CGU level.
	
The recoverable amount of a CGU is the higher of its fair value less cost to sell and its value-in-use, both of which are 
calculated by the Company using a discounted cash flow analysis. These calculations use pre tax cash flow projections 
over a period of three years, based on financial budgets approved by the management. For calculation of the recoverable 
amount, the Company has used the following rates:

Growth rate
5.00%
5.00%
Discount rate
19.40%
16.60%
	
The above discount rate is based on the weighted average cost of capital of the Company. These estimates are likely to 
differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows.
	
An analysis of sensitivity of the computation to a change in key parameters (operating margins and discount rate) based 
on reasonably probable assumptions, did not identify any probable scenario in which recoverable amount of the CGU 
would decrease below its carrying amount.
	
As at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the estimated recoverable amount of the CGU exceeded its carrying 
amount, hence impairment is not triggered.

34	 Financial risk management
	
The Company is exposed to various risks in relation to financial instruments. The Company’s financial assets and liabilities 
by category are summarised in note 35. The main types of risks are market risk (foreign currency exchange rate risk and 
price risk), business and credit risks and liquidity risk. The Company has in place a robust risk management policy with overall 
governance and oversight from the Audit Committee and Board of Directors. Risk assessment is conducted periodically 
and the Company has a mechanism to identify, assess, mitigate and monitor various risks to key business objectives.
	
The policies for managing specific risk are summarised below:
34.1	Market risk
	
Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flow of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes 
in market price. Such changes may result from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rate, price and other 
market changes. The Company’s exposure to market risk is mainly due to foreign exchange rates and price risk.
	
Foreign currency exchange rate risk
	
The Company’s exposure to market risk includes changes in foreign exchange rates. Most of the Company’s transactions 
are carried out in INR. Exposures to currency exchange rates arise from the Company’s overseas operations, which are 
primarily denominated in US dollars (USD), Pounds Sterling (GBP), EURO and Emirati Dirhams (AED). As of December 31, 
2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company has entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the effect of 
adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The details in respect of the outstanding foreign exchange forward 
contracts are given (refer to note 35.2).

For the year ended December 31, 2023, every 5% increase/decrease of the respective foreign currencies compared to 
functional currency of the Company would impact operating margins by C 1,557 lakh (+/- 4.58%). For the year ended 
December 31, 2022, operating margins would increase/decrease by C 1,449 lakh (+/-5.98 %). Exposure to foreign currency 
exchange rate vary during the year depending upon the volume of overseas transactions. Nonetheless, the analysis above 
is considered to be representative of the Company’s exposure to currency risk.
	
Price risk
	
The risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market 
prices, whether those changes are caused by factors specific to the individual financial instrument or its issuer, or factors 
affecting all similar financial instruments traded in the market. The Company has adopted disciplined practices including 
position sizing, diversification, valuation, loss prevention, due diligence, and exit strategies in order to mitigate losses.
	
The Company is exposed to price risk arising mainly from investments in mutual funds recognised at FVTPL. The details 
of such investment are given under note 8. If the prices had been higher/lower by 5% from the market prices existing as 
at the reporting date, profit would increase/decrease by C 2,821 lakh and C 1,646 lakh for the year ended December 31, 
2023 and for the year ended December 31, 2022 respectively.
	
The Company is also exposed to price risk arising mainly from investments in equity instruments recognised at FVTOCI. 
The details of such investment are given under note 8. If the equity prices had been higher/lower by 5% from the market 
prices existing as at the reporting date, OCI for the year ended December 31, 2023 would increase/decrease by C 1,248 
lakh and C 796 lakh for the year ended December 31, 2022.
34.2	Liquidity risk
	
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial 
liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. For the Company, liquidity risk arises from 
obligations on account of financial liabilities - trade payables and other financial liabilities.
	
Liquidity risk management
	
The Company continues to maintain adequate amount of liquidity/treasury to meet strategic and growth objectives. 
The Company has ensured a balance between earning adequate returns on liquidity/treasury assets and the need to 
cover financial and business risks. The Company’s treasury department is responsible for liquidity and funding as well as 
settlement management. In addition, processes and policies related to such risks are overseen by senior management. 
Management monitors the Company’s net liquidity position through rolling forecasts on the basis of expected 
cash flows.

34.3	Business and credit risks
	
To mitigate the risk arising from high dependence on any one business for revenues, the Company has adopted a strategy 
of diversifying in new products/services and into different business segments. To address the risk of dependence on a 
few large clients and a few sectors in the business segments, the Company has also actively sought to diversify its client 
base and industry segments.
	
Credit risk refers to risk that a counter party will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the 
Company. The Company is exposed to this risk for receivables from customers.
	
To manage credit risk, the Company periodically assesses the financial reliability of customers and other counterparties, 
taking into account the financial condition, current economic trends, analysis of historical bad debts and ageing of accounts 
receivable. Individual risk limits are set accordingly. The Company uses a provision matrix to compute the expected credit 
loss allowance for trade receivable. Trade receivables are monitored on periodic basis for any non-recoverability of the 
dues. Bank balances are held with only high rated banks. Refer note 13.4 for trade receivables ageing.

35.1	Fair value hierarchy
	
For financial reporting purpose, fair value measurements are categorised into Level 1, 2, or 3 based on the degree to which 
the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement 
in its entirety, which are described as follows:
	
Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
	
Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly 
(i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
	
Level 3 – Inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

the Company.

relatives, to the extent of their shareholding, if any, are in any

The Board recommends the Ordinary Resolution set out at 
item number 5 of the notice for approval by the members.
Item number 6
As per the provisions of Section 188 of the Companies Act, 
2013, transactions with related parties that are on an arm’s 
length basis and in the ordinary course of business are 
exempted from the obligation of obtaining prior approval of 
the members. However, as per the provisions of Regulation 
23 of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) 
Regulations, 2015 (“Listing Regulations”), transactions 
between the Company and a related party of the Company, 
if material, require the approval of members through a 
resolution, notwithstanding the fact that the same are on an 
arm’s length basis and in the ordinary course of business.
For this purpose, transactions with a related party will be 
considered ‘material’ if the transaction to be entered into 
individually or taken together with previous transactions 
during a financial year exceeds C 1,000 crore or 10% of the 
annual consolidated turnover of the Company as per the 
last audited financial statements of the Company, whichever 
is lower.
Under the Listing Regulations, in addition to the approval 
and reporting for transactions by the Company with its own 
related party(ies), the scope extends to transactions by the 
Company with related party(ies) of any subsidiary(ies) of the 
Company or transactions by subsidiary(ies) of the Company 
with its own related party(ies) or related party(ies) of the 
Company or related party(ies) of any of the subsidiary(ies) of 
the Company.
CRISIL has, since the year 2003, been a trusted partner of 
S&P Global Inc. (hereinafter referred to as “S&P”), which is the 
world’s foremost provider of credit ratings, benchmarks and 
analytics in the global capital and commodity markets. S&P is 
the ultimate holding company of CRISIL and CRISIL has been 
(even from the time prior to CRISIL becoming a subsidiary of 
S&P) providing analytical support services to entities related 
to S&P (hereinafter referred to as “S&P Group Entities”).
Pursuant to the enactment of the Companies Act, 2013, 
CRISIL had, on December 15, 2014, obtained approval of 
unrelated members, for entering into material Related Party 
Transactions for a maximum per annum amount of C 300 crore 
(Rupees three hundred crore only). This was in relation to 
provision of support for financial data and analysis services, 
in terms of a Master Service Agreement, being provided by 
CRISIL and/or its subsidiaries, through its Global Analytical 
Centre (GAC) division. GAC acts like a centralised research and 
analytics hub for S&P with teams spread across the US, EMEA 
and APAC regions.
Considering various factors, including growth in business 
and future outlook, it is possible that the transaction value 
of the services provided by GAC division of CRISIL and/or 
its subsidiaries, to S&P Group Entities under the MSA may 
exceed the current approved limit of C 300 crore per financial 
year, in the next fiscal year and the years thereafter.
Furthermore, the members may note that besides ratings, 
S&P Group Entities also offer environmental, social and 
governance (ESG) solutions, deep data, and insights on critical 
economic, market and business factors to its worldwide 
clientele. In recent times, CRISIL and its subsidiaries have 
expanded their scope of services to support S&P Group 
Entities in various non-financial analytical streams beyond 
credit ratings, such as ESG assessments and consulting, 
model validation, counter-party risk assessments, data 
operations and technology support, which are provided by 
other divisions of CRISIL and/or its subsidiaries (other than 
GAC division). It may be noted in this regard that while these 
transactions rendered by other divisions of CRISIL and/or 
its subsidiaries to various S&P Group Entities, are currently 
below the materiality threshold individually, these may also 
assume significant proportions in the forthcoming financial 
years. Further, no single entity of the S&P Group crosses the 
materiality thresholds for Related Party Transactions under 
the Listing Regulations.
In light of the aforesaid, it is proposed to expand the 
scope and coverage of the related party approval already 
obtained from the members as of December 15, 2014, to all 
transactions of support for financial and non-financial data, 
analysis and research, benchmarking, model validations, 
credit assessments, counter party risk assessments, ESG, 
operations, trainings and providing consulting, functional 
and technology support, which are to be provided by CRISIL 
and/or any of its subsidiaries through any of its divisions to 
S&P Group Entities (also referred to as “aforesaid Related 
Party Transactions” in the resolution). Further, considering 
the expanded scope of the services, growth of business over 
the period of last few years and future outlook, it is hereby 
proposed to expand the existing limit from C 300 crores 
(Rupees three hundred crore only), already approved by the

Tenure, value, material

CRISIL had entered into a Master Service Agreement (MSA) for provision of support 
for financial data and analysis services through its Global Analytical Centre (GAC) 
division to S&P Group Entities which are in the ordinary course of its business and on 
an arm’s length basis. During financial year 2023, the revenue generated under MSA 
aggregated to C 280.42 crore.
Considering various factors, including growth in business and future outlook, it is 
possible that the transaction value of the services provided by GAC division of CRISIL 
and/or its subsidiaries, to the S&P Group Entities under the MSA may exceed the 
current approved limit of C 300 crore per financial year, in the next fiscal year and the 
years thereafter.
Furthermore, in recent times, CRISIL and/or its subsidiaries have expanded their 
scope of services to support S&P Group Entities in various non-financial analytical 
streams beyond credit ratings, such as ESG assessments and consulting, model 
validation, counter-party risk assessments, data operations and technology support, 
which are provided by other divisions of CRISIL (other than GAC division). While these 
transactions rendered by other divisions of CRISIL and/or its subsidiaries to various 
S&P Group Entities, are currently below the materiality threshold individually, these 
may also assume significant proportions in the forthcoming financial years. Further, 
no single entity of the S&P Group crosses the materiality thresholds for Related 
Party Transactions under the Listing Regulations.
In light of the aforesaid, it is proposed to expand the scope and coverage of the 
related party approval already obtained from the members as of December 15, 2014, 
to all transactions of support for financial and non-financial data, analysis and 
research, benchmarking, model validations, credit assessments, counter party risk 
assessments, ESG, operations, trainings and providing consulting, functional and

through any of its divisions to S&P Group Entities. Further, considering the expanded

2014, to an amount of C 750 crore (Rupees seven hundred and fifty crore only) per 
annum, w.e.f. May 1, 2024, until April 30, 2029.
During this period, CRISIL will periodically evaluate contractual documentation to be 
executed for aforesaid Related Party Transactions to ensure business continuity and 
renewals from time to time.
The pricing mechanism followed for the aforesaid Related Party Transactions 
is and shall continue to be based on arm’s length principles applicable as per 
jurisdictional guidelines. Requisite valuation reports and confirmations are in place 
to the extent required and shall be obtained from time to time from reputed and 
independent consulting firms as may be required under the applicable laws, to 
establish compliance of arm’s length principles for all of the aforesaid Related Party 
Transactions.
It is clarified for the avoidance of doubt that the material Related Party Transactions 
placed for members’ approval under the terms hereof are specific in nature, approved

Preface
As a leading, agile and global 
analytics company, CRISIL helps 
businesses navigate risks in 
a dynamic and fast-evolving 
globalised environment. Further, 
we place sustainability at the very 
core of our business in terms of 
the analytical work we do for our 
clients and the way we conduct our 
own operations as a responsible 
global corporate citizen.
Ensuring a high degree of sustainability and 
business growth is imperative for businesses 
around the world. We recognised this trend 
early and worked meticulously towards 
creating environmental, social and governance 
(ESG) offerings, spanning research, data and 
insights, which enable our clients to make 
informed decisions.
The ‘ESG Compendium-ESG Gauge’ that was 
released in 2021, analysed 225 Indian listed 
companies as a part of CRISIL’s first offering in the 
ESG Research segment. Expanding the horizon of 
coverage, we analysed and scored 1000 companies 
across 63 sectors in 2023. Our Global Research & 
Risk Solutions (GR&RS) division enables the world’s 
leading banks, asset managers and financial 
institutions to address their sustainability needs 
and challenges by providing customised risk and 
data analytics, ESG and climate risk integration, 
and bespoke research services. The gamut of our 
services also covers strategy, gap assessment, 
policy framework and disclosures.
The commitment to sustainability is deeply 
ingrained in CRISIL’s policies and practices. We 
have a dedicated ESG policy, and a corporate 
social responsibility (CSR) policy, which 
underlines our commitment to improving 
our social impact across the communities 
we serve.
We have included environmental sustainability 
as one of the metrics for measuring business 
performance and implemented key initiatives in 
the areas of renewable energy usage, responsible 
waste disposal and resource utilisation, which are 
outlined later in this report.
Our employees are true change champions, 
as they volunteer for social causes such as 
environment conservation and mentoring of 
underprivileged students.
The talent and dedication of our employees 
provides us a winning edge in the marketplace. 
CRISIL has made concerted efforts to develop and 
nurture talent by adopting people-first policies. 
Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) is an essential 
thread that binds our organization and our value 
proposition is closely intertwined with innovation.
We engage with suppliers from diverse 
backgrounds, encourage them to evaluate their 
adherence to best-in-class policies and practices, 
and also train our supply chain partners on key 
ESG principles.
In line with CRISIL’s commitment to sustainability, 
we have formalised our ESG strategy and goals and 
continue to focus on emerging issues and trends. 
Finally, we reiterate that ESG will continue to guide 
our sustainability strategy and long-term value 
creation efforts.

Message from MD and CEO
Dear Stakeholders,
Over the past 37 years, CRISIL has become a 
trusted partner for decision-makers worldwide 
by offering valuable, timely analytics rooted in 
deep domain expertise.
We do business with integrity and steadfast focus on sustainability, 
which has helped us win the trust and goodwill of clients, policymakers, 
investors, employees and the community around us.
It is my privilege to 
present CRISIL’s third 
annual ESG report, which 
reflects our initiatives 
towards 
building 
a 
sustainable business. 
It underlines key ESG 
risks and opportunities 
material to our long-term 
value creation process.
Introduction
ESG Report 2023
06
'' 
Sustainability is foundational to everything we do. Our environmental, 
social and governance (ESG) research, data, insights, assessments and 
solutions empower markets and companies to make decisions with 
conviction and contribute to enduring progress globally.
It is my privilege to present CRISIL’s third annual ESG report, which 
reflects our initiatives towards building a sustainable culture and the 
outcomes thereof. It underlines key ESG risks and opportunities material 
to our long-term value creation process.
In 2023, we expanded our ESG coverage, improved disclosures 
and published our ESG policy that reiterated our commitment to 
responsible and sustainable business conduct. We initiated a materiality 
reassessment to improve our ESG quotient and to focus on areas needing 
urgent action.
We remain committed to making meaningful social impact.
In 2023, we moved to minimise our environmental footprint, by using 
renewable sources for more than half of our energy requirements, 
reducing Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions, recycling 90%+ waste and 
planting 54,000 trees.
We believe diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) help foster the innovation 
essential to our long-term sustainable growth. I am happy to inform that 
women represents 39% of our workforce and 39% of all hires in 2023.
Over 15 diversity-themed trainings were conducted for employees in 
2023. That, and the launch of Eskalera, an online learning platform 
designed to cultivate an inclusive work culture, were among the few ways 
in which we reaffirmed out commitment to DEI.
The above ensures employees get ample opportunities to learn, grow and 
most importantly, belong.
As a part of our community initiatives, CRISIL Foundation empowered 
more than 6 lakh rural women through financial literacy programmes in 
Assam and Rajasthan, making them self-reliant.
We remain relentless in our emphasis on corporate governance and 
doing business the right way.
Value creation and sustainable business practices are complementary, 
not disparate, goals. Our ESG journey is a testimony to that approach.
To our stakeholders, thank you for joining us in this quest.
Warm regards,
Amish Mehta
Managing Director and CEO

About the report
Our ESG reporting comprises an umbrella of publications pertaining to economic, social and environmental parameters. 
Together, they reflect our initiatives and outcomes towards building a sustainable organisation.
This is CRISIL’s third ESG Report in continuation to our 
inaugural ESG Report 2021. This report outlines CRISIL’s 
performance in all the three domains – E (Environment), 
S (Social) and G (Governance) during the calendar year 2023. 
All the metrics stated in this report pertain to calendar year 
2023 unless stated otherwise.
We are in the services business, specialising in research 
and analytics. Our solutions and services rely more on 
intellectual, rather than physical assets. We do not have any 
manufacturing facilities. Thus, among the ESG themes, the 
governance and social factors and their respective impacts 
are more relevant to us. Most of our operations are leased 
offices with limited opportunity to impact the energy footprint. 
However, we have taken efforts to switch to green energy at 
our owned offices and undertake tree plantation to contribute 
to environment sustainability.
The ESG report is prepared with reference to global frameworks 
namely the Global Reporting Initiative Standards (GRI) and 
Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the 
Indian Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting 
(BRSR) framework issued by SEBI. This Report in conjunction 
with our Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report 
and ESG Databook (also forms a part of CRISIL Annual Report 
2023) and the GRI and SASB indices, is a reflection of our 
initiatives and outcomes towards building a sustainable 
culture within our organization.
In 2023, our ESG processes were subject to an internal audit, 
followed by an external assurance process, making our ESG 
efforts more robust.
Refer to the Materiality Assessment section of this report.

ESG Governance @ CRISIL
CRISIL’s ESG Core Group Committee, a management-level 
steering committee, is chaired by Amish Mehta, MD & CEO. 
The committee’s objective is to identify and define the ESG 
strategy and goals and review performance and disclosure 
across ESG themes. In addition, the CRISIL Board annually 
reviews ESG goals and implementation action plans. The 
goals are then cascaded to CRISIL’s business leaders, and 
the progress is tracked and reviewed by the ESG Core Group.
Six ESG Core Group meetings were held in 2023. The Core 
Group actively reviewed and enhanced CRISIL’s current ESG 
practices to meet best-in-class international standards 
during the course of the year.
An ESG Policy was published in 2023 which outlines 
CRISIL’s commitment towards responsible and sustainable 
business conduct.
Read CRISIL’s ESG Policy
ESG governance at CRISIL is subject to internal audit. The 
CRISIL ESG Report 2023 is also externally assured.
Our employees are ambassadors of what CRISIL stands for and 
we believe that the best way to implement our ESG strategy is 
to involve them right at the beginning. It is imperative that they 
are updated about CRISIL’s progress and strategy on various 
aspects of ESG. Information encourages involvement and also 
enables employees to effectively communicate our strategy 
and achievements to external stakeholders.
We have rolled out exclusive training programmes on 
environmental and social dimensions for all our employees. In 
2023, we launched a special training on governance aspects, 
mandatory for all employees and contract staff. To enhance 
awareness on ESG and progressively embed sustainable 
principles into employees’ decision-making and thought 
process, we have also started publishing ESG newsletters and 
inviting experts to speak on pertinent ESG themes.

Materiality assessment and 
business strategy
In keeping with CRISIL’s commitment to enhance ESG performance, and pinpoint 
and refine the key focus areas that need action, we conducted a materiality 
re‑assessment in 2023.
Our approach
  STEP 1
Identification of material topics
STEP 5
Analyse implications
STEP 3
Engagement with stakeholders
STEP 2
Defining  stakeholder groups
STEP 4
Prioritising material topics
We began with revisiting our previously identified, 10 material 
topics, and added further dimensions for consideration, 
benchmarked through peer assessment, relevant industry 
standards, global standards such as GRI and SASB, and 
themes generated through existing internal processes around 
strategy, planning, risk assessment, voice of stakeholder 
surveys and policy governance.
Defining stakeholder groups was another important step of the 
materiality exercise. Based on our stakeholder engagement 
policy, we identified the stakeholder groups for consultation. 
Key internal stakeholders included the CRISIL leadership, 
Board and employees. Key external stakeholders included 
clients, supply chain partners, shareholders and beneficiaries 
of our community outreach programmes. This comprehensive 
consultation exercise involved a cross‑section of the aforesaid 
stakeholders belonging to various businesses, geographies 
and levels of criticality in terms of proximity, dependency and 
influence. A survey (conducted online) was then extended to 
those stakeholders, and facilitated by a third party.
The survey responses were sought on the dual criteria of 
relevance of the material topic to each stakeholder, as well as 
its importance to CRISIL. The responses were then analysed 
to prioritise topics as depicted in the materiality matrix below.
This update to our initial materiality analysis is one step 
ahead in dynamically building our ESG strategy. Facilitated 
by an external consultancy, this exercise identifies material 
topics that are critical to our  business success.
Based on the exercise, we identified 15 material topics that 
will drive our sustainability strategy going forward. The exercise 
also helped us identify risks and opportunities pertaining to 
each of these areas.
We recognise that materiality is a dynamic process, and 
we shall continue to monitor the evolution of global issues 
and needs, stakeholder expectations and changes within 
our company.

Remuneration Policy
The Nomination and Remuneration Policy of CRISIL 
lays down detailed guidelines for the remuneration of 
the Board, Managing Director, Senior Management and 
Employees, and covers fixed and variable components. 
Long-term incentives are envisaged for the Management 
and key talent to bind their performance to the company’s 
long‑term sustainability. These are in the form of Employee 
Stock Option Scheme (ESOS) with staggered vesting or 
performance-linked deferred cash with payouts in multiple 
tranches linked to the Company’s performance. The annual 
variable pay approach links to business, financial and non-
financial sustainability goals through the balance scorecard 
model by linking individual performance to the Company’s 
achievements, particularly with respect to environmental 
measures, inclusion and diversity matters, and overall human 
capital governance.
For more detailed disclosures on the remuneration of 
the Board and CEO compensation, please refer to the

CRISIL holds its employees accountable to the highest 
standards of ethical conduct and transparency in 
business practices.
CRISIL’s Code of Ethics outlines a set of expectations and 
standards in terms of ethical conduct, which we expect 
each of our employees to adhere to. These standards 
are comprehensive and cover areas such as conflict of 
interest, gift, favours, personal trading, equal opportunity, 
confidentiality, and information security.
Annual affirmation of the code, along with periodic training 
sessions on topical issues such as personal trading, 
confidentiality and privacy, reinforces expected employee 
behaviours. This is supplemented by regular communication 
on regulatory developments and business norms, and 
learnings from internal disciplinary actions. We conduct 
special drives throughout the year for raising awareness on 
compliance policies through mailers, online interactions, and 
Q&A sessions with employees.

Ensuring a conflict-free environment
We also treat maintaining confidentiality of client-specific information with utmost importance. A number of technical and 
policy measures are implemented to ensure confidentiality of data.
Data privacy
CRISIL has a robust privacy framework which includes 
personal data mapping, privacy impact assessment, privacy 
policy, training and awareness, data subject requests 
program and incident management. Privacy by design 
is central to CRISIL’s privacy framework. The risk-based 
framework enables CRISIL to comply with applicable data 
protection laws. The privacy program involves continuous 
monitoring and revalidation of existing framework for the 
new regulations, customer requirements and emerging 
technologies. CRISIL’s privacy policy articulates the principles 
followed with regard to collection, usage, disclosure, security 
and retention of personal data.
Read our Corporate privacy policy
Read our Confidentiality Policy
Directors and Senior Management are obligated to regularly 
disclose conflict of interest arising from ownership or 
directorship positions held in other entities.
Data protection and data security
Protection of data and ensuring security during data 
transmission are vital to CRISIL’s business.  Data 
protection involves implementation of measures such as 
use of encryption, role-based access control and data 
backup to safeguard the data from unauthorised access, 
alteration and destruction. It involves deployment of 
technical and administrative control measures to protect 
against vulnerabilities and threats such as malware or 
data theft.
At CRISIL, information security is an independent function, 
separate from IT. The Information Security Officer leads 
planning and development of information security 
architecture and policies. The policies are subject to regular 
audits (internal, ISO 27001, client audits) to assess our 
security posture and compliance against our obligations 
on an ongoing basis. Further, the information security team 
regularly updates the Risk Committee on information security 
and status of remediation plans implemented to mitigate 
risks, if any.

With the release of new ISO 27001 version 2022, CRISIL is now 
aligning its security policies to comply with the new standard. 
The IT and cyber risk framework have considerably progressed 
into an objective scoreboard, reviewed by the management 
on a monthly basis. The cyberthreat landscape is evolving 
with emerging trends and techniques used by attackers and 
CRISIL therefore is constantly working towards making all 
CRISILites ‘Cyber SMART’.
Personal trading policy
CRISIL has a robust personal trading framework in place 
in compliance with the SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) 
Regulations, 2015 and covers client requirements. The 
personal trading policy and procedures are annually reviewed. 
Trades are monitored using a dedicated IT tool. Several 
enhancements were made in the tool during the year to further 
strengthen our controls, such as automating the restricted 
list of securities, modules for submission of transaction 
statements, automated reconciliation of transaction 
feeds etc. 
The focus on rigorous messaging continues through several 
education sessions and compliance drives conducted during 
2023, as below:
	•
Orientation sessions for new joiners on a regular basis   
	•
19 refresher sessions during the year (both in person/
online), including business-specific and location-
specific sessions  
	•
Compliance slots in business Townhalls to drive the culture
SOC 2 Type 2 certification is a widely recognised standard 
that demonstrates an organisation’s commitment to ensuring 
the security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, 
and privacy of customer data. CRISIL’s flagship products and 
two business units are SOC 2 certified.
2023 saw considerable efforts in reducing the CRISIL attack 
surface area by closing known issues and vulnerabilities, 
thereby improving the security posture of our applications, 
systems and platform. We encourage employees to report any 
digital misbehaviours and issues.
To improve business efficiency and scale, CRISIL availed cloud 
services for various applications. As compared to on‑premise 
servers, cloud service providers have mature and secure 
infrastructure management capability which is an added 
benefit. At the same time, service and device protection 
becomes a shared responsibility with the cloud service 
provider. CRISIL has a robust cloud security governance 
including automated cloud security policies, vulnerability 
assessment scanning framework and tools for remediating 
cloud-related vulnerabilities.
In 2023, CRISIL successfully 
completed its Information Security 
certification - ISO 27001:2013.

The BCP outlines critical processes, downtime tolerance, 
and planned recovery methodologies, and ensures requisite 
alternative strategies are defined in the recovery plan. At the 
same time, it ensures safety of teams during emergencies. 
Crisis communications is embedded in the BCP. The 
technology department remains abreast of the changes and 
suitably undertakes projects for technology upgrades to keep 
the infrastructure current and state of the art.
Our employees regularly undergo BCP security & safety 
trainings.

Related party transactions
The Related party transaction policy was adopted by CRISIL 
to outline the processes for identifying and approving 
transactions involving related parties. 
Transactions with related parties are disclosed in our Annual 
Report. They are disclosed to the stock exchanges on a 
half‑yearly basis, and the information is also available on 
our website, at https://www.crisil.com/en/home/investors/

support provided by CRISIL’s Global Analytical Centre was 
sought through in December 2014. This contract was approved 
by the minority shareholders, without participation of S&P. 
Services provided by CRISIL are at arm’s length pricing and in

Reduced GHG emissions
CRISIL offices play a pivotal role in managing our environmental 
footprint. We strive to design, build and operate our facilities 
in a manner that minimises resource consumption, reduces 
GHG emissions, and improves indoor environmental quality 
for the well-being of our employees. To support these efforts, 
we follow sustainability best practices, including operating 
from premises certified by the Indian Green Building 
Council’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design 
(LEED) certification programme. CRISIL’s Gurugram office 
In recent years, climate change has emerged as one of the most pressing issues. Although CRISIL’s business does not contribute 
significantly to GHG emissions, we acknowledge that our actions play a significant role in establishing industry standards 
and exemplifying best practices. To support our environmental goals, we are tracking our emissions and implementing best 
practices in our management.
CRISIL’s commitment to emission-related goals
Being a subsidiary of S&P Global Inc, CRISIL is covered under 
S&P Global Inc’s SBTi commitment.
Refer to SBTi website for S&P’s validated SBTi commitment
As a part of this commitment, CRISIL is on a journey to reduce 
absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 25.2% by 2025 
from a 2019 base year.
CRISIL achieved a major milestone in this journey in 2023, by 
transitioning its largest energy-consuming premise, CRISIL 
House, Mumbai, to 100% renewable energy sourcing. This 
contributed to a significant 64% reduction in our Scope 1 & 2 
carbon emission over 2019.
While we burn a small amount of fuel on-site, mostly diesel 
generators are used only as back-up power, on account of 
which, our Scope 1 emissions are low.

renewed its LEED Gold certification in 2023. Currently, 19% 
of our office premises in India in sq. ft. terms, have Green

CRISIL allows comprehensive accounting for indirect 
emissions by incorporating business travel, work-
from‑home, capital purchases and other purchased 
goods into Scope 3. Our Scope 3 emissions accounts 
for 85% of total emissions. CRISIL continued collecting 
actual emissions data from its supply chain to enhance 
the accounting for GHG emissions. Sensitisation and 
encouragement of supply chain to begin monitoring and 
disclosing the carbon impact of their operations, remains 
the main goal.
Furthermore, there was increased attention on tracking 
our carbon footprint through business travel which 
contributes to 30% of our overall Scope 3 emissions. During 
2023, we introduced a tracker of travel-related emissions 
by business, in our effort to keep such emissions at 
acceptable level.

CRISIL RE, of CRISIL the flagship environment conservation 
programme, works on urban afforestation in line with two 
UN SDGs namely, ‘Climate Action’ and ‘Life on Land’. The 
programme engages CRISIL employees and their families, 
friends, and relatives in conservation and other socially 
responsible activities. So far, this has led to planting of more 
than 208,000 native trees across cities in India.
Under the aegis of the CRISIL CSR Policy, CRISIL RE, CRISIL’s 
environmental conservation programme focusses on 
urban afforestation by planting native trees in the vicinity 
of CRISIL offices. The programme also strives to actively 
engage employees and their families, friends and relatives in 
environmental conservation. This involves preserving oceans 
and forests, and addressing climate change and its impact 
– thereby positively impacting two UN SDGs ‘Climate Action’ 
and ‘Life on Land’.
Through CRISIL RE, CRISIL Foundation has delivered 
meaningful impact towards environment conservation, taking 
the cumulative number of trees planted to over 208,000 (2015 
to 2023) across 42 plantation sites. This year, focus was on 
creating mangrove forests at the Sundarbans (West Bengal), 
by planting 54,000 saplings.

Shaping the larger social consciousness quotient 
Focussed and meaningful engagement, both physical and 
virtual, has played a key role in driving responsible social 
consciousness among CRISILites.
Tree plantation and maintenance drives, under the 
campaign ‘Your #DateWithNature’, in Mumbai, Pune and 
the Sundarbans brought CRISILites and their families 
together, actively participating in tree plantation, 
post‑plantation and maintenance drives. This played a crucial 
role in protecting, restoring and rebuilding our planet.
In 2023, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of World 
Environment Day (June 5), over 400 CRISILites across six 
locations (Mumbai, Gurugram, Hyderabad, Chennai, Pune and 
Ahmedabad) came together to create solar lamps. This was 
part of the ‘Light A Lamp’ initiative, an in-office volunteering 
initiative supported by S&P Global. Under this programme, 
1,000 lamps were created and distributed to rural households 
in Assam and Rajasthan (where CRISIL Foundation’s financial 
capability building programmes are being implemented). 
This initiative integrated community impact and employee 
responsibility, making a positive impact on both fronts.
As part of our annual Daan Utsav, CRISILites contributed 
books, ration, clothes, and footwear by partnering with 
NGOs such as Robinhood Army, Goonj and Greensole for 
donating these essentials to underprivileged members of 
the society.

Water conservation
Dwindling freshwater resources and erratic changes in 
weather patterns have highlighted the need for water 
conservation. Recognising the importance of water 
conservation, CRISIL has made efforts to recycle water 
and leverage technology to improve water efficiency, 
wherever possible.  
Conservation of water resources for rural communities 
is a new area of intervention undertaken as part of the 
Company’s CSR programme. Water conservation structures 
have been created to improve access to drinking water in 
two tribal villages of Udaipur (Rajasthan), through: 
	•
repair/restoration of open wells
	•
construction of water storage tanks and 
	•
installation and improvement of water distribution 
systems
CRISIL recycles 8.3% of water consumed*
CRISIL House Mumbai, has a sewage treatment 
plant for recycling of water which is routed to 
sanitary use and for watering 17,000 sq. ft. of green 
area in the premises
Several water efficiency measures have been 
implemented, including low-flow fixtures, aerators, 
sensor-based taps and regular calibration checks 
have been ensured
*Water data is available only for Mumbai, Pune and Gurugram offices, 
which are exclusively managed and controlled by CRISIL. During 2023, 
2 India offices namely Ahmedabad and Kolkata started reporting water data. 
Other locations are managed offices for which data is not currently available.

How CRISIL and the local communities united to make 
Jambrung water accessible
In the vibrant village of Jambrung, nestled in Raigad 
district just 90 km away from the bustling metropolis of 
Mumbai, a tale of resilience unfolds. With a population 
of 1,500, they face a daunting water shortage from 
January to June. Despite the beautiful Ulhas river 
flowing nearby, it runs dry, leaving the villagers longing 
for relief. Even the bountiful rains of the Konkan region 
from June to September slip away, untapped and 
wasted. This forces the villagers to rely on expensive 
water tankers, burdening their pockets.
Moreover, their agricultural endeavours, from 
cultivating water-intensive paddy crops in the Kharif 
season to nurturing Lima beans in other seasons, 
further amplify their demand for water.
Recognising the gravity of the situation, the local 
government authorities embarked on a mission to 
address the water crisis plaguing these households, 
some of whom have resided in the village for centuries. 
Last year, in an inspiring collaboration, CRISIL 
Foundation and its NGO partner erected a check 
dam to impede the escape of precious rainwater. 
The result? A lifeline for the village, ensuring access 
to water even in the dry month of April. This dam 
not only replenished the groundwater, revitalising 
the village’s weary borewells, but also provided 
a vital buffer, extending the water supply for an 
additional two months until the long-awaited 
rains arrived.
Recently, a dynamic group of CRISILites, accompanied 
by enthusiastic villagers, descended upon the check 
dam site to prepare the dam for the impending 
rainy season, meticulously cleaning and fortifying 
it with stones. This collaborative effort between the 
CRISILites and the villagers epitomised unwavering 
determination and teamwork, achieving remarkable 
progress in a short span of time.
Let us not overlook the remarkable hospitality 
bestowed upon our team by the villagers. Their warmth 
and generosity added an extra layer of fulfilment to 
this memorable experience. As we forge ahead, we 
remain committed to transforming communities, one 
village at a time.

Waste management
In 2023, we continued our efforts to monitor both wet and dry 
waste through the standard operating procedures rolled out 
in 2022. While dry waste was handed over to scrap vendors 
for recycling, wet waste was directed to certified vendors for 
processing at suitable locations.
Continuing our commitment to responsible paper 
consumption, we transitioned five offices to eco-friendly 
printing paper in 2023. We are continuously monitoring 
opportunities to replace printing activities with eco-friendly 
paper alternatives. CRISIL’s Annual Report is printed on 
recyclable paper every year.

The spirit of DE&I has been the bedrock of CRISIL’s growth 
story. It shapes the value proposition for our employees as 
we actively embrace a culture that values diversity and equity 
with meritocracy. In 2023, we used the recommendations of 
the DE&I taskforce set up in 2022 to further enhance inclusion 
at CRISIL. One such key initiative was commencing the 
Eskalera journey for CRISIL employees. Eskalera is an online 
learning platform designed to cultivate a more productive and 
inclusive work culture through upskilling, human connection 
and actionable data.
In 2023, we continued to focus on leadership development of

external programmes to bring in an outside-in perspective, 
particularly in the context of building a leadership pipeline, 
understanding global best practices and providing best-in-
class development opportunities to our people. Initiatives 
such as speed mentoring, workshops on enhancing 
intercultural competency and celebration of events related 
to various dimensions of diversity were planned with a wider 
footprint. All this created a gently encouraging and supportive 
environment, which probably also gave confidence to a couple 
of our employees to come out of the closet last year.
DE&I is also a key parameter in the balanced scorecard for 
CRISIL businesses.

Promoting women in leadership 
At CRISIL, our constant endeavour has been to empower 
and encourage women to have thriving careers. We adopt 
a conscious approach to increase their representation at 
managerial and above levels. Considerable efforts made 
for the growth and development of women leaders – hiring 
efforts across levels (from campus hires to leadership with 
differential referral incentives), internal pool of mentors 
for mid-career women employees, coaching opportunities 
and competency-based development – have yielded 
substantial impact.
Going forward, our focus will be on strengthening the fabric 
of our inclusive culture with regard to the intersectionality of 
women with various other dimensions of diversity – gender 
identity, sexual orientation, multigenerational workforce, 
intercultural groups, differently abled and neuro-diverse, to 
name a few.

Women leadership success story
“It is amazing that my line manager nominated me 
for the 1,000 Women Leaders Programme by Jombay 
when my tenure at CRISIL had only been a few months, 
I will always remember that. For me, the design and 
construct of the programme stood out – there was 
never a dull moment; you had to be wired in from day 
go. I think the outside-in approach really worked for 
me. The programme carefully stitched together a set 
of frameworks and approaches and had an interesting 
mix of competency-based modules interspersed 
with industry leaders walking us through their shared 
experiences to make it real and interactive. The digital 
learning platform and its treasure trove of nuggets 
made sure we were referencing what we were learning 
constantly. It definitely delivered on the ‘immersive’ 
experience for me – it was a fully connected programme.”

i.	 Hiring related initiatives
	
CRISIL ensures adequate representation of women 
in the candidate slate for all open positions. Multiple 
channels, such as job fairs, campuses and lateral 
candidates from the job market, are leveraged for the 
same. Early career women talent is leveraged from 
multiple campuses. 
Gender diversity, as a metric, is a reference while taking 
hiring decisions at the entry level to ensure proportional 
representation. We deploy governance checks at key 
milestones in the hiring process to alleviate any potential 
bias in selection or offer fitment. The internal mobility of 
employees is encouraged before external candidates are 
evaluated for any given position.
ii.	
Creating a safe, secure and sensitive work environment
	
CRISIL has taken multiple steps to create a safe, secure and sensitive work environment in the hybrid working model:
Put in place a mechanism to 
ensure all employees are aware 
of the company’s POSH policy and 
its contents
Created a safe space for 
employees to voice their concerns 
through surveys, and regular 
check-ins
Provided external legal expertise 
from which to seek help, if 
required
Set up an anonymous portal-
chat box, and/or complaint 
box for reporting inappropriate 
behaviour
Made employees aware of 
the implications of evolving 
regulations on safety and 
security
Set up an active forum, Buddy 
Mother Networks, that connects 
expectant and new mothers with 
other women employees
Provided a nudge to employees 
on the etiquette they need to 
follow while working from home
Established special measures for 
the safety and security of women 
colleagues during commute
Enabled special measures 
for women employees post 
maternity, including rating 
protection, counselling, reduced 
working hour programme, creche 
facilities, etc.

iii.	 Career development programmes for women
	
All development programmes at CRISIL are consciously 
designed to ensure equitable gender representation 
and leadership enablement. Leadership Excellence 
and Accelerated Development (LEAD), Leadership 
Excellence Program (LEP) and the 1,000 Women Leaders 
Programme in association with Jombay are some key 
initiatives towards building a strong pipeline of women 
leaders at CRISIL. Moreover, mentoring initiatives are 
open throughout the year for women employees. We 
have brought in external facilitators to help create an 
internal pool of mentors. 
	
CRISIL uses occasions such as International Women’s 
Day to partner with women-led businesses in the 
context of employee engagement.
We interviewed Ms. Shyamala Gopinath, Independent 
Director, CRISIL Limited and Ms. Vinita Bali, former 
Independent Director, CRISIL Limited during the 
February 2023 Board meeting.
They discussed their experiences and learnings, along 
with the importance of gender diversity at the workplace. 
The conversation was recorded and shared with all CRISIL 
employees on the internal communication engine.
With 3,000+ views, it certainly inspired many employees 
to micro-action on leadership aspirations as well 
as allyship.
Leadership interview
CRISIL’s Board members make time to interact with women 
employees. In the past year, women leaders were invited to 
interact with Ms Holly Kulka, Board Member, CRISIL Ratings.
The interactions typically involve the Board member sharing

LGBTQIA+ initiatives  
(supporting the rainbow community) 
Globally, some landmark events have transpired in recent 
years around broader acceptance of sexual orientations and 
gender identity.
CRISIL whole-heartedly supports inclusive policies for 
the LGBTQIA+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/
questioning, intersex and asexual/aromantic/agender 
plus) spectrum.
CRISIL covers same-sex partners in the medical insurance 
policy, and it covers gender affirmative surgery.
We understand that LGBTQIA+ is complex; hence, enabling 
psychological safety for all is one of the most important 
factors towards greater inclusion. The Eskalera platform 
has been leveraged to understand concepts of identity, 
vulnerability, inclusion, exclusion and psychological safety. 
This platform has helped us set the tone for discussion on 
various sensitive issues around LGBTQIA+ inclusion. Events 
around the Pride Month (June) set an adequate premise for

The various initiatives planned through the year ensure that employees have avenues to upskill themselves on an ongoing 
basis. To cater to different needs, various interventions across target groups, were launched through the year.
At the leadership level 
A marquee programme LEAD 
was launched in 2021, to develop 
identified successors and build P&L 
leaders for the future.
The first batch concluded this year. 
The second batch was launched in 
October this year.  This is a 6-month 
journey with a mix of learning 
methodologies that include learning 
labs, simulations, immersions, 
assessments, and action learning 
projects.
In addition to the above, journey-based programmes, digital 
learning platforms were made available to employees on a 
demand basis, for self-paced learning. This enabled them 
to have access to world‑class content across behavioural, 
technical, and creative areas.
Specific learning programmes were curated and delivered 
basis business requirements. We launched the CRISIL 
Essential Tech chapter this year, as well as self-paced 
courses of Essential Tech. Some cutting‑edge technology 
offerings have been made available to employees.
At the middle managerial level 
A 
3-4 
month 
journey-based 
programme was launched. 
The objective was to equip participants 
with leadership skills - self-awareness, 
strategic thinking, developing teams 
and driving productivity.
The programme included day‑long 
sessions on each of these themes, 
along with opportunities to connect 
with the facilitator and co‑participants 
for peer learning and sharing. 
At the first time or tenured 
managerial level (Manager)
A similar programme like the other 
two were launched, with the same 
themes. However, these learning 
interventions were more light touch, 
to introduce the themes stated and 
provided tips/best practices and tools 
for implementation. 
Equal opportunities 
and treatment
CRISIL has adopted a Policy on Equal 
Opportunities at the Workplace. Our 
commitment to maintaining a discrimination-
free work environment extends to all 
persons involved in operations and prohibits 
discrimination or unlawful harassment. All 
employees are responsible for treating others 
with dignity and respect.

Over the past 12 months, we have had the opportunity to 
bring in industry leaders and scientists to talk about their 
leadership journeys, challenges along the path and the impact 
created in the larger ecosystem. Such conversations have 
sparked interest amongst employees to bring forth their best. 
Many leaders across business units have penned blogposts 
on internal forums on how their teams and mentors enable, 
support and equip them for success at work and beyond.
Additionally, we looked at mandatory courses (annual 
refreshers) with a new approach. Some were introduced 
with an assessment-based approach. Moreover, a 
majority of the courses were launched early in the year 
to allow sufficient time for employees to complete 
them. All the above initiatives enable learning and 
development to enhance operational efficiencies and 
future-readiness.

Promoting health and wellness 
Being in the financial services sector, our workplace and 
processes are inherently non-hazardous and safe. However, 
we acknowledge the importance of providing working 
conditions that support safety, well-being and health.
Standard operating norms have been issued to ensure 
that all offices in India comply with working conditions and 
health and safety measures. In 2023, all offices in India and 
the larger ones in London and New York were assessed on 
comprehensive parameters, including but not limited to, 
health and safety, child labour, forced labour and prevention 
of sexual harassment.
CRISIL also has a Health and Safety Policy in place, which 
covers the impact the nature of work has on health, including 
ergonomic health impact, fire safety, communicable diseases 
and commute/business travel safety. The policy is aimed 
at including employee participation to eliminate hazards 
and reducing occupational health and safety risks. Further, 
CRISIL provides health and safety training to all its employees 
to create awareness and promote health and safety within 
the organisation. As part of our efforts to enhance employee 
safety, CRISIL launched a mobile application to alert 
employees about emergencies and crisis situations.
Risk assessment is a key dimension of our health and 
safety programme. Developments in the external and 
internal environment such as socio-political disturbances, 
natural disasters, climate change impacts, resource 
disruptions and health issues are monitored globally and 
evaluated regularly to strengthen the existing programme. 
Office infrastructure has periodic maintenance of 
electric and electronic devices, and cafeteria services 
ensure healthy food – all to ensure employee safety 
and well-being.

Driving social change amongst local communities
CRISIL’s commitment to sustainability is woven into its 
policies and practices. We have a dedicated CSR policy 
that underlines our commitment to improve our social impact 
across the communities we serve. Our efforts are directed 
towards supporting, building, and growing these crucial 
societal facets.
Mein Pragati, the flagship CSR programme, is currently 
being implemented in over 5,000 villages of Assam and 
Rajasthan. This is facilitated through a well-trained, 
all‑women community cadre of Sakhis. This cadre has 
helped address the last-mile constraints in awareness and 
access to financial services. As on date, these sakhis have 
supported over 2 million rural community members, mostly 
women, by facilitating access to banking, and other financial, 
and social security schemes.
CRISIL Foundation’s efforts through Mein Pragati have led to 
a larger partnership – the MoneyWise Centre for Financial 
Literacy (CFL) project being implemented in India with support 
from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), 11 public sector banks 
and NABARD. This scales-up CRISIL Foundation’s financial 
awareness and inclusion efforts through 615 CFLs across 
50,000 villages spread across 14 states and four union 
territories. By building these into timely, relevant, and trusted 
centres of knowledge, CRISIL has taken a firm step towards 
enabling ‘last-mile financial inclusion’, critical to the country’s 
long-term development.
For its CSR efforts during the year, CRISIL Foundation 
was awarded the ‘CSR Foundation of the Year’ (in the 
small companies’ category) at the 9th CSR Impact 
Awards 2023, organised by CSRBOX and Dalmia Bharat 
– for its financial capability building and environment 
conservation initiatives.
Respect for human rights 
CRISIL supports the protection of human rights across its 
value chain. The recruitment, remuneration, and promotion 
of employees is based purely on merit, irrespective of their 
race, religion, gender, and nationality. We do not encourage 
any kind of involuntary employment, and towards this 
end, have undertaken several initiatives, including the 
adoption of an Anti-Slavery Policy, which extends to CRISIL’s 
subsidiaries as well. The policy interdicts forced and child 
labour and slavery in operations.
Our Supplier Code of Conduct requires suppliers and 
vendors to uphold our objective of protecting human rights 
by fraud prevention and prohibiting child and forced labour, 
promoting health and safety, and being environmentally 
compliant and sustainable.
CRISIL prioritises the safety of its employees. Further, to 
reinforce appropriate conduct respecting human rights, a 
social sensitivity training on the themes of modern slavery, 
child and forced labour, equal opportunity, and DE&I is made 
mandatory for all employees.

Mein Pragati (in Assam and Rajasthan) 
Launched in Assam in 2015 and replicated in Rajasthan in 
2016, Mein Pragati (meaning ‘I Am Progress’ in Hindi) aims to 
empower rural women through financial capability building.
Phase I of the programme empowered over 1.65 lakh women 
through multi-touchpoint financial literacy workshops. Phase 
II aimed to consolidate the programme to achieve deeper and 
more meaningful intervention with participants of Phase I by 
creating a cadre of community workers called the ‘Sakhi’ to 
support the community in building their financial awareness 
and access. In 2022, Mein Pragati expanded into new 
geographies as part of Phase III.
As on date, the programme has been scaled to cover over 
5,000 villages across 24 districts of Assam and 6 districts 
of Rajasthan.
The cadre is leveraged to create awareness and facilitate 
access to banking services and government schemes; and 
strengthening institutional infrastructure to drive positive 
financial behaviour. Over the years, CRISIL has made 
significant investments to build the Sakhis’ capabilities 
through a ‘phygital’ model of using a mix of technology and 
human interface.
Sakhi cadre continue to drive last-mile impact
Through regular capacity building and handholding, the 
Sakhi cadre is trained to drive long-term behavioural 
change among rural women by easing their access to 
government schemes/programmes and addressing 
last‑mile constraints in accessing financial services. The 
cadre proactively drives linkages and earns an income 
through a service fee model and guided rate card for various 
banking and financial services, referred to as the Basket of 
Services (BoS).
The programme has completed two phases and is now in 
its phase III

Seamless expansion of Sakhi cadre
Between 2018 and 2023, the Sakhis have gained 
confidence and experience, with a majority of them 
expanding their coverage area to adjacent villages. 
Of the 5,200+ Sakhi cadre, over 4,100 
Sakhis are being actively supported 
by CRISIL Foundation through its NGO 
partners. The remaining 1,091 Sakhis 
are currently working independently 
without any handholding support.

revenue on monthly basis.

Our first Sakhi-turned-Sarpanch in Rajasthan
“I am the first Sakhi from Rajasthan who 
contested and won the local Panchayat 
elections, way back in 2019. My views 
are being sought by the Sarpanch (village 
head) – especially while accessing banking 
and welfare entitlements for the village. 
But that was not all. I have now learned how 
to facilitate digital payments. Now, I can 
recharge my phone, send small amounts 
of fund transfers, pay LIC instalments, and 
even book online as and recharge my DTH. 
I have also helped the community to use 
these facilities.
Being a Sakhi has transformed my life, and I 
am grateful to Mein Pragati for having built 
my confidence and stature in my village.”
GramShakti Certification Programme
Having proved the efficacy and relevance of Sakhi cadre in 
Assam and Rajasthan, CRISIL Foundation devised an online 
learning and certification programme called GramShakti 
incorporating all the best practices involved in training and 
development of Sakhis. Accessed through a tech-based 
learning application, customised in regional languages 
with interactive and engaging content, the programme 
comprises theory and practical assignments.
Launched in late 2018, GramShakti is CRISIL Foundation’s 
attempt to provide a scalable model for creating a pan‑India 
cadre of trained community leaders who can effectively 
address the issue of financial exclusion and empower women.
During the year, the programme expanded to over 1,260+ 
end users across CRISIL Foundation’s intervention areas 
and replicated in non-intervention locations through 
partnerships - taking the total end users count to 4,860+. 
There are currently 1,840 Sakhis/community cadre who 
have been formally certified through a convocation programme 
and provide support to their communities through last-mile 
awareness and handholding.

Empowered Entrepreneurship: Archana Rabha’s inspiring journey
Hailing from the farthest village of Hathibandha, a village 
along the Assam-Meghalaya border, Archana joined the CRISIL 
handloom initiative in 2022 and attended various training 
workshops (technical, design, business & social media).
At the time of joining the programme, she used to earn about 
C 10,000 annually from the weaving by selling traditional Rabha 
clothing such as Pazar, Rufan, Khemlet etc.
Prior to receiving new frame loom and jacquard machine from 
CRISIL, she used to own a traditional bamboo post loom with 
restricted productivity. Upgradation has made her life easy as 
she can now weave better products in best quality.
Her traditional product range has diversified to more 
contemporary market-ready products such as stoles, 
dupattas, yardages, table linens (runners & placemats), 
sarees, and home linens.
She has been catering to multiple national buyers like Sanskritik 
(New Delhi), and local buyers from Assam in B2B segment. Post 
loom and jacquard upgradation, her revenue from handloom 
weaving has shot up to C 90,000 as of November 2023.
Archana is now an Artisan Entrepreneur, managing and 
supporting 18 associate artisans in her village.

Livelihoods in Rajasthan
During 2023, a pilot project was started in Didwana, a Mein 
Pragati village, to support 35 unskilled rural women towards 
rug making and market linkage to improve their monthly 
incomes. Over the course of 6 months, the weavers were 
trained and developed rugs, thereby generating income for 
their households. This pilot has been expanded to cover an 
additional 71 women weavers across two villages – Didwana 
and Ramgarh Pachwara (both Mein Pragati project locations). 
MoneyWise Centres for Financial Literacy
The quality of work Mein Pragati programme showcased, led 
the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to appoint CRISIL Foundation 
for its prestigious MoneyWise Centres for Financial Literacy 
(CFL) pilot project in 2017, starting with 25 centres in 
Maharashtra, Haryana, and Rajasthan. Strong performance 
track record established during this pilot phase, resulted 
in RBI awarding a very large/ambitious mandate to CRISIL 
Foundation in its expansion phase of the project. As a result, 
CRISIL has scaled up its coverage through 615 CFLs to cover 
over 50,000 villages across 1,700 blocks in 338 districts of 14 
states and four union territories of India – with support from 
the RBI, 11 PSU banks and NABARD.
These centres work towards raising financial awareness, 
promoting good financial practices, and driving sustainable 
change in behaviour among people in their catchments. By 
building these into timely, relevant, and trusted centres of 
knowledge, CRISIL has taken a firm step towards enabling 
‘last-mile financial inclusion’, which is critical to the country’s 
long-term development.
Handloom and loom upgradation
Upskilling and sustaining the weaver 
entrepreneurs through loom upgradation, 
linkage with the State Rural Livelihood 
Mission and NABARD’s livelihood and 
enterprise development programme.
Women beneficiaries of Mein Pragati who 
had been trained on upgraded looms, 
initiated production and have been 
receiving orders for an expanded range 
of products. This has also increased 
production capacity and brought down 
weaving time.

Stakeholder engagement
Interacting with stakeholders is essential to the organisation’s 
success because it allows for the integration of their 
requirements into its objectives. CRISIL believes it is critical 
to interact with people and comprehend their requirements, 
wants and concerns. These kinds of interactions also 
guarantee efficient and long-lasting cooperation. For each of 
our stakeholders, we institutionalised structured feedback 
mechanisms which provide us with good insights on their 
expectations from their relationship with CRISIL.
Every quarter, the Board’s Stakeholder Relationship 
Committee examines grievances from all stakeholders 
including clients, employees, shareholders, suppliers and 
business partners. Over the course of the year, the Committee 
reviewed the results of stakeholder surveys and the entire 
engagement process, going beyond the purview of grievance 
handling. This is reflective of the importance attributed to 
stakeholder needs at the topmost level at CRISIL.

Sustainable supply chain
CRISIL’s aim is to make sustainability foundational in 
everything we do. For CRISIL, it is essential to engage with 
partners who are environment conscious, diverse and 
operate ethically.
About our supply chain
CRISIL works with a supply chain which has 1,290+ service 
providers, predominantly in the areas of IT services and 
support; IT software; IT equipment providers; facility 
management; administration and security; and consultancy 
and professional service providers. Our supply chain is 
predominantly based in India. The annual spend through 
our supplier chain is C 592.06 crore. A significant part of our 
supply chain comprises business in the small and medium 
scale sector.
90%
of our supplies are procured 
from local suppliers
Governance around the supply chain
CRISIL’s Supplier Code of Conduct serves as a guideline for 
environmentally friendly, socially acceptable, and ethically 
righteous supply chain. CRISIL looks at suppliers as strategic 
partners and thus endeavours to engage with partners having 
similar vision towards ESG. ESG is about making a difference - 
for your business and our world. Creating sustained outcomes 
that drive value and fuel growth, whilst strengthening our 
environment and societies is the mindset that drives our 
supply chain interventions.
CRISIL provides fair and equal opportunity to all suppliers. 
Partnering with diverse suppliers is a significant component 
of CRISIL’s overall commitment to seeking a diverse and 
inclusive workplace. CRISIL’s Central Procurement Team is 
based in India and manages global procurement. However, 
for local needs for each geography, we engage with 
local suppliers.
The key initiatives on governance around our supply chain are:
Improving employee 
training and awareness 
on ESG 
Improving supplier 
diversity
Driving driving sustainability 
related practices in supply 
chain by increasing social 
assessments, training, and 
coverage for emissions data
Setting highest standards of 
corporate governance
Supply chain sustainability assessment
CRISIL is committed to maintaining the greatest ethical 
standards. We anticipate that our supply chain will uphold 
the same standards and make sure that all relevant laws, 
rules, and regulations including those pertaining to human 
rights are followed.
CRISIL strives to establish an ethical, diverse, and 
environmentally responsible supply chain. CRISIL encourages 
its supply chain partners to embrace the values outlined 
in the CRISIL Supplier Code of Conduct to lead them on 
this path. Our Supplier Code of Conduct describes the 
minimal standards of behaviour to which CRISIL expects its 
suppliers to comply within the areas of child labour, health 
and safety, environmental stewardship, fraud prevention, 
non-discrimination, and business ethics. A distinct 
provision under the terms and conditions of the Purchase 
Orders (PO) sent to vendors emphasises the importance of 
adherence to the Supplier Code of Conduct.

We encourage our suppliers to evaluate their adherence 
to best-in-class policies and practices. These practices 
encompass protection of human rights, provision of safe 
workplaces, and environmental responsibility. Through 
self‑assessments, CRISIL ensures that our suppliers adhere 
to minimum social norms such as OFAC compliance, minimum 
wage standards, child labour prevention, and anti-bribery 
measures. The assessments are conducted periodically, and 
any unfavourable responses on the above minimum social 
regulations from our suppliers are reviewed by business and 
corporate teams, leading to necessary actions, ensuring no 
material gaps remain un-addressed. Minimum adherence 
to social norms enlisted above forms part of the onboarding 
criteria for new vendors from 2023.
Supply chain diversity
CRISIL is committed to partnering with all suppliers with 
integrity in an ethical manner, as well as supporting and 
encouraging the aspirations of diverse groups. 
CRISIL is conscious of the need for inclusive procurement, 
to deliver broader societal benefits by generating economic 
opportunity for disadvantaged communities. The CRISIL 
Supplier Diversity Framework welcomes marginalised 
sections of suppliers classified as Micro, Small and Medium 
Enterprises (MSMEs) and businesses owned by women, 
veterans, people with disabilities, and from the LGBTQIA+

Supply chain capacity building
CRISIL launched a new supply chain training in 2021 to 
reinforce our efforts to encourage our suppliers to adhere 
to our Supplier Code of Conduct. The training focusses 
on CRISIL’s key policy framework that governs the supply 
chain, the CRISIL Supply Chain Code of Conduct and CRISIL’s 
Supplier Diversity Framework. 
CRISIL provides training to its suppliers with an aim to build 
supplier capacity and focus on ESG. The training series 
cover topics in areas such as social and environmental 
sustainability, business conduct and compliance. The training 
also emphasises the supply chain’s need to adopt responsible 
standards for managing energy use, GHG emissions 
and waste.

Creating environment-conscious supply chain
At CRISIL, we measure our carbon footprint by considering 
emissions not only from our own operations, but also from 
upstream activities, such as the procurement of capital goods 
and other purchases. Our supply chain has emerged as a 
significant contributor to our carbon footprint, surpassing 
emissions from our own facilities. CRISIL is focussed on 
sensitising, raising awareness and fostering behavioural 
changes within its supply chain. CRISIL requires its suppliers 
to report GHG emissions stemming from the lifecycle of 
their products and services. This information is crucial 
for various reporting requirements, including BRSR. We 
actively encourage and support our supply chain partners 
in measuring and disclosing the carbon footprint of their 
operations. Towards this end, CRISIL decided to request 
emission value from suppliers where aggregate purchase 
order value exceed C 10 Lakhs, excluding small and medium 
enterprises and other similar categories where there was 
a challenge in availability of accurate emissions data. The 
response received primarily refined our approach towards 
data collection in relation to indirect emissions through 
supply chain.
Vendor engagement process
Engaging with stakeholders is pivotal for the success of the 
organisation, as effective engagement with stakeholders 
helps shape their needs into organisational goals. Therefore, 
CRISIL believes that it is important to engage with them 
and understand their expectations, needs and concerns. 
Such engagements also ensure seamless and enduring 
collaboration.
Suppliers are encouraged to report any unethical practice or 
grave misconduct observed while providing services to CRISIL, 
on: whistleblower@crisil.com.

CRISIL 
An S&P Global Company 
Our ESG products and services 
CRISIL is committed and well-poised to support the 
sustainability demand of its clientele. Our ESG analysis, 
information and insights, evaluations and solutions empower 
clients and other stakeholders to make decisions with 
conviction and contribute to sustainable progress globally.
Global ESG investors are focussing on the sustainability 
credentials of their investments, while regulators are 
simultaneously enhancing fund labelling and disclosure 
rules to mitigate greenwashing. Demand for ESG integration 
is expanding across asset classes including fixed income 
and alternatives led by institutional investors. Global 
sustainability reporting regulations are becoming unified 
and complex, requiring corporations to evaluate and report 
on a wide range of sustainability topics. As these practices 
mature, stakeholders are calling for broader and credible 
non-financial information from both public and private 
corporations. 
CRISIL Global Research and Risk Solutions’ (GR&RS) 
supports sell‑side houses, asset managers and other financial 
institutions to address their ESG challenges by augmenting 
their ESG research capabilities, enhancing quality of credit 
risk assessment by incorporating ESG factors and addressing 
issues related to availability bias and data deluge that impact 
ESG evaluation.
CRISIL’s bespoke research solutions are used by investment 
research firms to enhance and augment their ESG 
research capabilities.
In India, CRISIL Ratings explicitly highlights the impact of ESG 
parameters in rating rationales, especially for entities with 
access to capital markets (equity and debt) and those reliant 
on foreign investors for funding. 
As a first offering in the CRISIL ESG Research segment 
in India, ‘ESG Compendium-ESG Gauge’ was released in 
2021, wherein we analysed and scored top 225 listed Indian 
companies. Expanding the horizon of our coverage, during 
2022, we analysed and scored 586 companies across 53 
sectors in the CRISIL Sustainability Yearbook, 2022 and 
during 2023, we analysed and scored 1,000 companies 
across 63 sectors. The scores have enabled the corporates to 
measure and monitor inherent ESG risk across their financial 
exposures, both equity and debt.
Also, in line with the Securities and Exchange Board of 
India’s (SEBI) recent regulatory framework for ESG rating 
providers (ERPs), CRISIL Ratings Limited has established a 
wholly‑owned subsidiary, CRISIL ESG Ratings and Analytics 
Limited (CRISIL ESG), to engage in the ERP business. CRISIL 
ESG has applied for ESG Rating Rating provider license. 
Post receipt of approval, the current ESG scoring business 
of CRISIL Limited will be transferred to CRISIL ESG. This 
proactive approach underscores CRISIL’s commitment to 
compliance with evolving regulations and its aspiration to be 
a leader in ESG ratings.

also influence policy and outcomes. In order to ensure that 
our engagement on public policy matters is responsible,

Engagement. It demonstrates what guides us while engaging 
on public policy matters, the manner of engagement, and sets 
out the responsible behaviour expected of employees while 
engaging with regulators, industry or other forums.
Thought leadership on ESG  
As part of our thought leadership and outreach initiative, we 
authored several opinion pieces and articles on important 
industry and regulatory developments in daily premier and 
online platforms. We also contributed as knowledge partners, 
speakers or panellists at various summits organised by 
industry associations. During the year, we reached out to 
more than 26,000 stakeholders, including government

GHG computational method
Organizational boundaries
Reported greenhouse gas emissions are an outcome of activity data 
collected from 11 locations in India as well as other international 
offices in Argentina, China, UK, Poland and the USA that are under 
the operational control of CRISIL Limited. The reporting period of this 
inventory is calendar year 2023.
The emission calculation includes Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions from 
all relevant Kyoto Protocol gases. The below sources of emission have 
been included in the scope of this inventory.
Scope 1 emissions: these are direct emissions resulting within an 
organization’s boundary and arise from sources that the organization 
owns or controls. In the case of this inventory, the scope 1 sources 
include natural gas combustion, fuel combustion, fugitive emissions 
of refrigerants, combustion of fuels in backup generators.
Scope 2 emissions: these are indirect emissions from the electricity 
that is used by the organization and is outside the organization’s 
boundary.
Scope 3 emissions: this includes all other indirect emissions that 
occur outside the organization but are a result of the activities related 
to the organization. In the case of this inventory, the scope 3 sources 
include business travel (via road, rail, and air), hotel stay, paper and 
work from home provision for employees.
Data computational methods
An independent GHG inventory has been developed for all the 
locations under CRISIL Limited. A detailed discussion conducted with 
representatives from CRISIL to understand the operational boundary 
and identification of sources of GHG emissions. After the discussion, 
the data for these identified activities resulting in scope 1, 2, and 3 
captured for calculation.
Provided below is the general process of activity data collection and 
source of respective emission factors that have been used for the 
calculation:
Stationary combustion: The total annual quantity of high-speed 
diesel (fuel) used by diesel generators (Diesel used is owned DG set 
which is part of scope 1 and shared DG sets which are part of scope 3) 
was captured and used for the emissions calculation. The emissions 
factor for the calculation were derived from the IPCC 5th Assessment 
Report for CO2, CH4, and N2O. Similarly, The Global Warming Potentials 
(GWP) were sourced from the IPCC 5th Assessment Report for CO2, 
CH4, and N2O. In certain cases where the total amount spent on the 
purchase of HSD is available, instead of the quantity consumed, the 
annual average price of HSD is per liter for 2023 has been taken from 
the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas, Government of India (ppac.
gov.in) to obtain the total quantity of HSD consumed. 
∑Total Diesel Consumption (in liters) x Liter to kg conversion x 
Net Calorific Value x Emission factor (CO2, CH4 and N2O) = Total 
Emissions from DG sets owned in buildings
Mobile emissions: The total annual quantity of fuel consumed in 
company-owned vehicles accounting for scope 1 as well as fuel used 
for employee commute and business travel via road accounting to 
scope 3, were captured and used for the emission calculation. The 
emissions factor for diesel was sourced from the IPCC 5th Assessment 
Report for CO2, CH4, and N2O. Similarly, The Global Warming Potentials 
(GWP) were sourced from the IPCC 5th Assessment Report for CO2, 
CH4, and N2O. In certain cases where the total amount spent on the 
purchase of HSD, petrol and CNG available, instead of the quantity 
consumed, the annual average price of HSD or petrol per liter and 
CNG per kilogram for 2023 was taken from the Ministry of Petroleum 
& Natural Gas, Government of India (ppac.gov.in) to obtain the total 
quantity of respective fuel consumption. The emission factors for 
petrol and CNG have been sourced from DEFRA 2023.
If fuel consumption from mobile sources is given in amount spent
∑ Total Amount Spent on Diesel Consumption (in INR) x Average 
INR of Diesel in 2023 x Liter to kg conversion x Net calorific value x 
Emission factor – IPCC (CO2, CH4 and N2O) = Total mobile emissions
∑ Total Amount Spent on CNG Consumption (in INR) x Average INR 
of CNG in 2023 x Emission factor (DEFRA) = Total mobile emissions
∑ Total Amount Spent on Petrol Consumption (in INR) x Average INR 
of Petrol in 2023 x Emission factor (DEFRA) = Total mobile emissions
∑ Emissions for 1 km = Power *Emission factor (CEA Grid)
Where, Power = Battery of Electric vehicles (in MWh) / Mileage (in Kms)
If fuel consumption from mobile sources is given in liters/kgs of fuel
∑Total Diesel, Petrol, or CNG consumption (in liters) x Emission 
factor (DEFRA/IPCC) = Total mobile emissions
Fugitive emissions: The quantity of refrigerants based on the monthly 
top-up on air conditioning equipment. The emissions factors were 
sourced from the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural 
Affairs, 2023 (DEFRA-2023).
∑Total refrigerants top – up in buildings (in kg) x Net calorific value 
x Emission factor (CO2, CH4 and N2O) = Total fugitive emissions
Gaseous fuels LPG emissions: The quantity of LPG used in office 
locations was captured and used for the calculation of emissions. 
The emissions factors were sourced from the UK Department for 
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, 2023 (DEFRA-2023).
If fuel consumption from provided in Kgs
∑Total LPG consumption (in kg) x Net calorific value x Emission 
factor (CO2, CH4 and N2O) = Total LPG emissionss
If fuel consumption provided in amount spent
∑Total LPG consumption (in INR) x Average INR to kg conversion 
based on commercial LPG prices in 2021 x Net calorific value x 
Emission factor (CO2, CH4 and N2O) = Total LPG emissions
Emissions from electricity consumed: The total electricity consumed 
in kWh was collected for each of the buildings in the target locations. 
The corresponding location wise grid emission factors were sourced 
from the websites and publications of base countries (India: CEA 
grid emission factor report, UK: 2023 Government Greenhouse Gas 
Conversion Factors for Company Reporting, USA: EPA database, 
Argentina: IGES database, China: IGES database)

sourced from the IPCC 5th Assessment Report for CO2, CH4, and N2O. 
Similarly, The Global Warming Potentials (GWP) were be sourced from 
the IPCC 5th Assessment Report for CO2, CH4, and N2O. The annual 
average price of HSD or petrol per liter for 2023 was taken from 
individual country level prices from government databases.
∑Total Diesel or Petrol amount claimed (in INR) x Avg. INR to Liter 
of Diesel or Petrol in 2021 x Liter to kg conversion x Net calorific 
value x Emission factor (CO2, CH4 and N2O) = Total emissions
Hotels stay: The number of nights stayed in the hotel for the year 
were captured and used to calculate the emissions due to stay in 
the hotel. The emission factor used for respective travel modes was 
sourced from the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural 
Affairs, 2023 (DEFRA-2023).
∑Total number of nights stayed (in days) x Emission factor (CO2e) 
= Total emission
Work from Home emissions: To properly account for home working 
emissions, energy use and natural gas consumption, which would 
not have occurred in an office-working scenario has been accounted 
for. We have used a no survey approach based on the white paper 
by Anthesis Group  which uses two parameters:  number of remote 
workers and recommended regional energy intensities (i.e., energy 
consumed per person per day) for estimating the amount of electricity 
and natural gas consumed. Further to this, the energy consumption is 
then multiplied by appropriate emission factors to calculate the GHG 
footprint of remote workers. 
To obtain the energy intensity (i.e., energy consumed per person per 
day), we have used two relevant data categories, 
•	
Baseline Energy Intensity: which refers to the energy consumption 
measured in a household before the pandemic period when some 
household members might have been home during the day while 
others were working outside of the home. These are derived by 
dividing the energy consumption data from International Energy 
Agency (IEA) by the corresponding country’s population data.
•	
Incremental Energy Intensity: which refers to the incremental 
energy consumption measured in a household, in which some 
household members have transitioned to working from home, 
causing an increase in residential energy use. The incremental 
energy intensities are an average of select countries covered by 
the various studies on remote work.
The value for these two categories has been taken from the estimates 
provided in the discussed white paper. These values are region 
specific, hence the values specific to region under our consideration 
are obtained. These regions are North, Central and South America 
(AMER), Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), and Asia pacific 
(APAC). The energy intensity is then calculated as provided in below 
equation which is then multiplied with the emission factor to obtain 
the work from home emission. 
Energy use per day (kWh/person/day)
Baseline energy intensity (kWh) x  Ratio of incremental to baseline
Where, Ratio of incremental to baseline is the ratio of incremental 
energy intensity and baseline energy intensity. 
Emissions from Work from home (tCO2e) = Number of employees 
working from home × Energy Intensity × Emission factor
Waste disposal emissions: The total waste depending on the type 
was captured under different categories. Depending on whether wet 
waste (kitchen waste) was being utilized for making compost, OR the 
waste was disposed off to recycling agencies, the emissions were 
calculated under Scope 2 and Scope 3 respectively. The emission 
factors used for waste type and the processing done were obtained 
from the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, 
2023 (DEFRA – 2023).
Emission from waste (tCO2e) = Quantity of waste (in kg or tonnes) 
× Emission factor (CO2e)
Purchased goods and services emissions: The actual emission 
numbers from suppliers/vendors has been collected. The same has 
been used to calculate the total emissions from purchased goods. 
However, in cases where the emission numbers were not available 
the following methodology has been used: 
The total amount spent on purchased goods has been collected. 
Trucost’s environmentally extended input-output (EEIO) method 
has been used to calculate the total emission. The emission factor 
combines industry-specific environmental impact data with 
quantitative macroeconomic data on the flow of goods and services 
between different sectors in the economy. The scope of calculation 
covers the annual spent on Advertising and related services, Business 
support services, Employment services, Facilities support services, 
Insurance carriers, Management, scientific, and technical consulting 
services, other computer related services, including facilities 
management, Software publishers, Telecom and Printing.
Capital goods emissions: The actual emission numbers from 
suppliers/vendors has been collected. The same has been used 
to calculate the total emissions from capital goods. However, in 
cases where the emission numbers were not available the following 
methodology has been used: 
The total amount spend on capital goods have been collected. 
Trucost’s environmentally extended input-output (EEIO) has been 
used to calculate the total emission. The scope of capital goods 
emissions covers office equipment and other hardware.

wage standards, child labor prevention, and anti-bribery measures. We believe learnings from this assessment will bring more rigour 
to our supplier assessment process and raise the bar on ESG practices across CRISIL’s supply chain over time. The assessments are 
conducted periodically, and any unfavourable responses on the above minimum social regulations from our suppliers are reviewed by 
business and corporate teams, leading to necessary actions, ensuring no material gaps remains un-addressed.

Leadership Indicators
1)	 Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and social topics or if 
consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.
	
We believe proactive and continuous engagement with key stakeholders is crucial to the success of a business enterprise. At CRISIL, 
feedback gathered in the course of engagement with stakeholders is taken into account and, after due evaluation, is incorporated to 
improve business processes. Significant learnings may also help shape our strategic initiatives and growth levers. Stakeholders are 
encouraged to put forth any concerns relating to their engagement with us and reach out to our senior management, if necessary. The 
engagement scores, complaints and other feedback from stakeholders are monitored at various levels of the management. They also 
receive the highest attention from the Board/Board committee in its reporting processes.
2) Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, and social topics (Yes 
/ No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these topics were incorporated into 
policies and activities of the entity.
	
Yes.
	
At CRISIL, consultation with the stakeholders is important for management of the ESG attributes in the areas such as governance 
oversight, employee enablement and well being, diversity & inclusion, stakeholder engagement and ESG offerings. Our top material 
issues were identified and prioritized based on their impact on our stakeholders and our business. Such feedback is an important input 
while devising goals and plans in these areas. Please Refer to Table 8 of the ESG Databook on the process for determining material ESG 
issues. Please refer to Materiality Assessment on page no 19 of ESG Report.
3) Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/ marginalized 
stakeholder groups. 
	
CRISIL has adopted a Policy on Equal Opportunities at Workplace whereby it commits to ensuring equal opportunity across the 
organization in all matters of employment and a workplace free from discrimination. We have a very diverse set of employees across 
the world, by gender, age and nationality. We are committed to ensuring an inclusive environment for all employees, where they can look 
forward to bringing their true, whole self to work each day.
	
Consultation with stakeholders is important for management of the ESG attributes in areas of diversity and inclusion, stakeholder 
engagement and ESG offerings. Such feedback is an important input while devising goals and plans in these areas. 
 
Promoting women leaders
	
It has been our constant endeavor at CRISIL to enable and encourage women to have thriving careers. There is a conscious approach to 
increase representation of women at managerial and above levels. Considerable efforts on growth and development of women leaders 
have yielded substantial impact – hiring efforts across levels (from campus hires to leadership levels with differential referral incentives), 
internal pool of mentors for women employees in mid-career levels, coaching opportunities and competency-based development 
journey. 39% of our workforce and 22% of our leadership include women.
 
Hiring and retention related initiatives for women talent
	
CRISIL ensures adequate representation of women in the candidate slate for all open positions. Multiple channels – job fairs, campuses, 
lateral candidates from job market - are leveraged for the same. Early career women talent is leveraged from multiple campuses. Gender 
diversity, as a metric, is a reference while taking hiring decisions at entry level to ensure proportional representation at ground level. 
Governance checks are deployed at key milestones in the hiring process to alleviate any bias on selection or offer fitment. Internal 
mobility of employees is encouraged before external candidates are evaluated for any given position. Leadership Excellence and 
Accelerated Development (LEAD), Leadership Excellence Program (LEP) and the 1,000 Women Leaders Program in association with 
Jombay are some key initiatives towards building a strong pipeline of women leaders at CRISIL.
 
LGBTQIA+ initiatives (Supporting the rainbow community)
	
We made structured efforts to attract and hire candidates from the LGBTIQA+ community. Our inclusion practices cover:
	
•	
A highly successful campaign: #BeAnAlly in June 2023 to celebrate PRIDE Month
	
•	
CRISIL covers same-sex partners in the medical insurance policy, and it covers gender affirmative surgery.
	
•	
The Eskalera platform has been leveraged to understand concepts of identity, vulnerability, inclusion, exclusion and psychological 
safety.
	
•	
“Leadership Chronicles” was conducted with several external leaders from various geographies and was very well received.

contributing towards significant reduction of our carbon footprint. This contributed to a significant 64% reduction in our Scope 1 & 2 
carbon emission over 2019. Proportion of energy consumption from renewable sources enhanced from 5% last year to 58% in 2023.
	
CRISIL adheres to a comprehensive accounting for indirect emissions by incorporating business travel, work-from-home, capital 
purchases and other purchased goods into Scope 3. Our Scope 3 thus encompasses 85% of total emissions. CRISIL continued collecting 
actual emission data from its supply chain to enhance the accounting for GHG emissions. Sensitization and encouragement of supply 
chain to begin monitoring and disclosing the carbon impact of their operations remains the main goal.
	
Furthermore, there was increased attention on tracking our carbon footprint through business travel which contributes to 30% of our 
overall Scope 3 emissions. During 2023, we introduced a tracker of travel related emissions by business, in our effort to keep such

crucial for various reporting requirements, including BRSR. We actively encourage and support our supply chain partners in measuring 
and disclosing the carbon footprint of their operations. Towards this end CRISIL decided to request emission value from suppliers where 
aggregate purchase order value exceeds C 10 Lacs, excluding small and medium enterprises and other similar categories where there 
was a challenge in availability of accurate emissions data. The response received primarily refined our approach towards data collection 
in relation to indirect emissions through supply chain.

Financial well-being & independence, and livelihoods opportunities go together and hence, CRISIL Foundation, in 2018 initiated a few livelihood 
pilots (on a small scale) in Assam. Starting with 75 households in 2018, they gained steady momentum through enhanced household coverage, 
and improved income generation for over 1,500 households by 2021. During 2023 a pilot project was started in Didwana, a Mein Pragati village, 
to support 35 unskilled rural women towards rug making and market linkage to improve their monthly incomes.
	
CRISIL Foundation’s efforts through Mein Pragati have led to a larger partnership – the MoneyWise Centre for Financial Literacy (CFL) 
project being implemented in India with support from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), 11 public sector banks and NABARD. This scales-
up CRISIL Foundation’s financial awareness and inclusion efforts through 615 CFLs across over 50,000 villages spread across 14 states 
and four union territories. By building these into timely, relevant, and trusted centres of knowledge, CRISIL has taken a firm step towards 
enabling ‘last-mile financial inclusion’, critical to the country’s long-term development.
	
For its’ CSR efforts, during the year, CRISIL Foundation was awarded the 'CSR Foundation of the Year' (in the small companies’ category)

Independent Assurance Statement 
Introduction 
DNV represented by DNV Business Assurance India Private Limited ('DNV') was engaged by CRISIL Limited ('CRISIL' or 
"Company", Corporate Identity Number: L67120MH1987PLC042363) to undertake an independent assurance of the 
Company's sustainability/non-financial performance disclosures in its ESG Report 2023 ('the Report'). The report has been 
prepared based on material topics identified by CRISIL in reference to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability 
Reporting Standards 2021 ('GRI Standards') and other sustainability information reporting framework such as SASB. 
Company's ESG report also covers the BRSR disclosures prepared based on the requirements of SEBI Circular no. 
SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD-PoD-1/P/CIR/2023/123 dated July13,2023, prescribing format of the BRSR, the guidance notes and 
the nine principles of the National Guidelines on Responsible Business Conduct, 2019 ('NGRBC') of the Ministry of Affairs, 
Government of India. 
The intended user of this assurance statement is the Management of CRISIL ('the Management'). 
Our assurance 
engagement was planned and carried out during November 2023 - February 2024. 
DNV planned and performed the work using AccountAbility's AAl000 Assurance Standard (AAl000AS v3) and additional 
principles of DNV's assurance methodology VeriSustain™1. DNV's VeriSustain Protocol has been developed in accordance 
with the most widely accepted reporting and assurance standards. We performed the activities applying Type-2 -
Moderate Level of Assurance. 
The agreed scope of work included Type-2 -
Moderate level of assurance of Company's non-financial/sustainability 
performance disclosures reported for the period from 01 January 2023 to 31 December 2023. The reported topic 
boundaries of non-financial performance is based on the internal and external materiality assessment covering CRISIL's 
operations as brought out in Corporate the report. The assurance engagement considers an uncertainty of ±5% based on 
materiality threshold for estimation/measurement errors and omissions. 
Responsibilities of the Management of CRISIL and of the Assurance Provider 
The Management of the Company has the sole responsibility for the preparation of the Report and are responsible for all 
information disclosed in the Report as well as the processes for collecting, analysing and reporting the information 
presented in the Report. CRISIL is also responsible for ensuring the maintenance and integrity of its website and any 
referenced disclosures on sustainability performance. In performing this assurance work, DNV's responsibility is to the 
Management of the Company; however, this statement represents our independent opinion and is intended to inform the 
outcome of the assurance to the stakeholders of CRISIL. 
DNV provides a range of other services to CRISIL, none of which in our opinion, constitute a conflict of interest with this 
assurance work. Our assurance engagements are based on the assumption that the information provided by the client to 
us as part of our review have been provided in good faith and is complete, sufficient, authentic and free from 
misstatement. We expressly disclaim any liability or co-responsibility for any decision a person or an entity may make 
based on this Assurance Statement. 
We did not come across limitations to the scope of the agreed assurance engagement during our assurance process. We 
understand that the reported data on economic performance, including expenses towards Corporate Social Responsibility 
(CSR) incurred by the business and contributions to towards CSR expenses, are based on disclosures and data from 
CRISIL's audited financial statements presented in its Annual Report 2023, which is subjected to a separate independent 
statutory audit process, and is not included in our scope of work. 
Basis of our Opinion 
A multi-disciplinary team of sustainability and assurance specialists performed assurance work of CRISIL 
considering a Type-2 - moderate level of assurance based on DNV's VeriSustain We adopted a risk-based 
approach, that is, we concentrated our verification efforts on the issues of high material relevance to Company's 
1 The VeriSustain protocol is based on the principles of various assurance standards including International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (ISAE 3000) 
Revised (Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information) and the GRI Prindples for Defining Report Content and Quality, 
international best practices in verification and our professional experience; and is available on request from www.dnv.com.

businesses related to operations and maintenance, projects which are within the boundary of the Report and its 
key stakeholders. We undertook the following activities: 
• 
Review of CRISIL's approach to identification of material topics and the processes of stakeholder engagement, 
and CRISIL's responses as brought out In this Report. We did not have any direct engagement with external 
stakeholders. 
• Interviewed personnel (Internal stakeholders) responsible for the management of sustainability topics and 
reviewed selected evidence to validate the disclosures presented in the Report. 
• Examined and reviewed sustainability performance documents and other information made available by the 
Company related to the non-financial disclosures and consolidating the sustainability performance information 
related to the identified GRI Topic-specific Standards. 
• Visited CRISIL's Corporate Office located in Mumbai in Maharashtra, India to review sustainability performance at 
corporate level covering implementation of overall sustainability strategy. 
• As part of the exercise, we assessed the site-level (sampled sites) sustainability performance through a remote 
and Onsite verification at sample site Offices covering Gurgaon, Pune, Mumbai Office including review of the 
processes and systems for preparing and consolidating site-level sustainability data in line with the principles of 
reliability, accuracy and completeness. We were free to choose sites for conducting our assessment. 
Opinion and Observation 
On the basis of our assurance work undertaken, nothing came to our attention that suggests that the disclosures In the 
Report are not fairly stated and have not been prepared, in all material aspects, in reference to reporting criteria i.e. GRI 
Standard 2021 and BRSR requirements, as well as criteria for reporting for the identified material topics. Without affecting 
our assurance opinion, we also provide the following observations: In addition, Annexure - I to be referred which covers

Statement
This statement is published by CRISIL Ltd about and to 
enable its subsidiaries that are subject to the Act, including 
in particular CRISIL Irevna UK Ltd and Coalition UK Ltd 
(subsidiaries). CRISIL and its subsidiaries are together 
referred to as CRISIL entities.
Forced, bonded or compulsory labour, human trafficking and 
other kinds of slavery signify some of the severest forms 
of human rights abuse. We are committed to improving our 
practices to combat slavery and human trafficking.
Organisational structure
CRISIL Ltd provides ratings, research, and risk and policy 
advisory services in the knowledge process and business 
process outsourcing sector. S&P Global Inc is the parent 
Company. CRISIL has its registered office in Mumbai, India. 
We operate in India, China, Singapore, England, Poland, 
Argentina, Australia, and the United States of America, and 
have about 4,000 employees worldwide. Our global annual 
turnover is in excess of £36 million.
Our supply chains
Our supply chains include consultants, advisors, IT (hardware 
and software), and other office equipment suppliers, 
professional services from our lawyers, accountants and 
other advisers, security, catering, office cleaning and other 
office facilities services, staffing companies, etc. We require 
all of our suppliers to conduct business in a lawful and ethical 
manner as part of our supplier on-boarding process, and 
accept our trading terms and conditions.
Our policies on slavery and human trafficking
We are committed to ensuring that there is no modern slavery 
or human trafficking in our supply chains or in any part of 
our business. Our Modern Slavery Act, 2015, policy reflects 
our commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in all 
our business relationships, and implementing and enforcing 
effective systems and controls, to ensure no slavery and 
human trafficking takes place in our supply chains.
Due-diligence processes for slavery and human 
trafficking
As part of our initiative to identify and mitigate risk, we have 
in place systems to:
• 	 Identify and assess potential risk areas in our supply 
chains
• 	 Mitigate the risk of slavery and human trafficking in our 
supply chains
• 	 Monitor potential risk areas in our supply chains
• 	 Protect whistleblowers
• 	 Where possible, build long-standing relationships with 
local suppliers and make clear our expectations of 
business behaviour
Supplier adherence to our values
We have zero tolerance to slavery and human trafficking. We 
ensure all those in our supply chain and contractors comply 
with our values and ethics.
Training
We provide training to our staff to ensure a high level of 
understanding of the risks of modern slavery and human 
trafficking in our supply chains and our business.
Our effectiveness in combating slavery and 
human trafficking
The Act is relatively new and very few companies, including 
CRISIL entities, have experience of seeking out, let alone 
detecting, slavery or trafficking among their own staff
or among their suppliers. To date, CRISIL entities are yet to 
detect or suspect that any CRISIL entities or suppliers employ 
persons who may be enslaved or trafficked.
Therefore, key performance indicators can be set only in 
respect of reasonable due diligence efforts once experience 
of the initial outputs of such exercises are collated and 
analysed. This statement is made pursuant to Section 54(1) 
of the Modern Slavery Act, 2015, and constitutes our slavery 
and human trafficking statement.
