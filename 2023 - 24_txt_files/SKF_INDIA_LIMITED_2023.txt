Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details.
	
We are committed to achieving Net Zero emissions for our manufacturing sites by 2030. To reach this ambitious goal, 
we have implemented several initiatives aimed at transitioning from thermal energy sources to renewable energy. Key 
among these initiatives is our adoption of Power Purchase Agreements (PPA), which enable us to purchase renewable 
energy from off-site sources. We are also working on several energy efficiency projects like compressors, heat treatment, 
central utility systems & grinding operations efficiency improvement. These strategic measures are critical in reducing 
our carbon footprint and supporting global sustainability efforts.

10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted 
by your Company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the 
practices adopted to manage such wastes.
 	
a.	
We are deeply committed to waste management and sustainability, beginning with rigorous waste segregation 
at the source to maximize diversion from landfills. For non-hazardous waste, we ensure 100% recycling through 
partnerships with authorized recyclers, guaranteeing that these materials are reprocessed and reintroduced into the 
supply chain. In the case of hazardous waste, we strictly adhere to all government regulations and guidelines. Our 
approach prioritizes diverting as much of this waste as possible from landfills by either recycling or repurposing it 
through waste-to-energy initiatives. These efforts demonstrate our dedication to minimizing environmental impact 
and promoting a circular economy.
	
b.	
Our commitment to sustainability extends beyond managing waste generated within our campus to actively 
recovering waste from the broader environment that results from our business activities. Last year, we successfully 
collected and recycled over 450 metric tons of plastic waste associated with our product packaging. This significant 
effort underscores our dedication to environmental stewardship and our proactive approach to addressing plastic 
pollution. By recovering and recycling post-consumer plastic waste, we not only mitigate the environmental impact 
of our products but also contribute to a cleaner and more sustainable planet.
