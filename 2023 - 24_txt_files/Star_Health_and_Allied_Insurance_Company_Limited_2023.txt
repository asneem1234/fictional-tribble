Data Privacy, 
Information &
Cyber Security
Risk
• 
In an era where data is a critical asset, the risk associated 
with data privacy, information, and cyber security is 
paramount for Star Health.
• 
With the increasing reliance on digital platforms for 
customer engagement and data storage, the company 
is exposed to potential cyber threats and breaches that 
can compromise sensitive customer information.
• 
The evolving regulatory landscape, including the 
Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA) and other 
regulatory interventions, further increase the importance 
of robust data protection measures to ensure 
compliance and safeguard against legal and reputational 
risks.
• 
Star Health is committed to adopting a comprehensive 
approach to mitigate risks associated with data privacy, 
information, and cyber security.
• 
This includes implementing advanced security technologies, 
regular security assessments, and penetration testing to 
identify and address vulnerabilities.

Ethics & Compliance are critical assets for Star Health to 
maintain its brand & reputation in market. They are built 
over time through consistent delivery of quality services

• 
However, in the dynamic healthcare insurance industry, 
any negative event or perception, such as customer 
dissatisfaction, regulatory non-compliance, or ethical

Health Safety
Risk
• 
Occupational health and safety are critical areas of focus 
for Star Health Insurance Company Limited. The well-

penalties. In the insurance industry, where employees 
are the backbone of customer service and satisfaction, 
ensuring their health and safety is paramount.

safety, Star Health has implemented comprehensive policies 
and procedures. These include regular safety audits, employee 
training programs on health and safety protocols, and the 
provision of appropriate protective equipment. We also 
have a dedicated health and safety team that continuously 
monitors and reviews our practices, ensuring compliance 
with regulatory standards and industry best practices.

• 
Employee well-being refers to the overall state of 
workers’ physical, mental, emotional and economic 
health, which can often be influenced by various 
workplace dynamics (e.g., workload, connections with 
co-workers and available resources). Although employee 
well-being is typically considered an HR-related matter, 
it’s also an enterprise risk that directly correlates with a 
wide range of key business objectives
• 
The company supports employees' physical health and 
mental well-being by providing Mediclaim and other 
insurance covers. The Star Wellness App enhances employees' 
access to healthcare facilities.
Negative
5
Human Rights
Risk
• 
Ensuring fair social practices, respecting human rights, 
and complying with applicable laws are fundamental 
ethical considerations and critical for maintaining a 
motivated and productive workforce. Noncompliance 
can lead to legal, reputational, and operational risks.
• 
The Company prioritizes the protection of human rights

to the Company’s Code of Conduct. To ensure compliance, 
the Company provides comprehensive training programs to 
employees specifically covering human rights topics.

Such risks can impact employee retention, productivity, 
and overall morale, which are crucial for sustaining 
business operations and growth.
•

that promote diversity, inclusion, and equal opportunities.

logistics can lead to productivity and revenue losses.
• 
Moreover, market uncertainties, political instability, and 
natural disasters further underscore the importance of 
robust supply chain strategies.
• 
High dependency on a limited number of suppliers 
or vendors increases procurement risks, potentially 
impacting business continuity and profitability.
•

with multiple suppliers/vendors. Continuous discussions and 
communication are maintained with these suppliers/vendors

line with industry-leading practices. They conduct Business Impact Analysis (BIA) to evaluate the processes and assess the impact of 
disruptions on customers, financial and non-financial aspects, and regulatory compliance. Based on this analysis, they identify Recovery 
Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO) for critical services, defining the time within which services need to be 
restored and the maximum period for data recovery, respectively. The team devises recovery strategies for stress scenarios such as 
technology unavailability, people unavailability, and site unavailability to minimize potential business loss. They also draft resumption 
plans for critical business functions to ensure the resumption of services at minimum operating levels in case of a disaster. Periodic drills 
are conducted to ensure the effectiveness of recovery strategies, with a focus on continually improving resumption techniques based 
on the learnings from these drills. The BCM plans are tested semi-annually or annually, depending on the criticality of the function.
