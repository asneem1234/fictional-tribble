Innovation 
and Digitalisation
Risk
Risks associated with increased scale 
of operations.
The Company aspires to scale up its 
production to 4 million units by FY 2030-31. 
This is nearly twice the scale from 2 million 
units production achieved in FY 2023-24. 
While the Company has taken nearly 40 
years to increase its scale to 2 million units 
per annum, the scaling up to next 2 million 
units would be done in just 7-8 years. This is 
nearly 4 times faster
To realise this growth plan, while the 
resource requirement such as human 
capital, financial capital and the know-
how would increase steeply, the time 
required for making decisions would need 
to come down.
Besides, the stakeholder partners such as 
Suppliers, Dealers, Transporters, would 
also need to scale up in line with the 
Company’s plan.
•	 The Company is 
collaborating with its 
stakeholder partners to 
pre-empt the challenges 
associated with rapid 
scaling up and managing 
the increased scale 
of operations.
•	 The Company has put 
in place a separate 
organisation to work 
towards the measures 
required to achieve the 
goals for FY 2030-31. 
•	 For managing increased 
scale of operations, 
a faster decision 
making would be 
required. Towards 
this, the Company is 
leveraging digitalisation 
to enhance data-based 
decision making.

Risk
Ensuring Continuity in Component  
Supplies
The Company has over 400 tier 1 
suppliers and nearly 1500 tier 2 suppliers 
spread across geographies. Therefore, 
one of the largest sources of business 
continuity risk is the risk of disruption 
of component supplies. The disruption 
may be due to natural and man-
made disasters.
•	 Maintaining close 
communication 
with suppliers
•	 Optimising the use of 
critical components such 
as semiconductors in 
electronic components
•	 Use of alternate 
semiconductors in 
electronic components
•	 Alternate suppliers
•	 Enhanced focus 
on localisation
•	 Temporary increase 
in the inventory 
of components
•	 Use of advanced 
technologies for 
prevention and quick 
suppression of fire

Risk
Safeguarding Consumer and 
Personal data
By the virtue of its business operations 
ranging from manufacturing to sales 
to service, a lot of personal data gets 
generated. The loss or theft of such large 
quantum of personal data may impact the 
Company’s brand reputation
•	 Policies, governance 
structure and 
technological solutions 
are strengthened to 
safeguard the consumer 
and personal data

Cyber security
Risk
Cybersecurity
With increased digitalisation, the 
dependence on IT systems has increased 
drastically. Any disruption due to gaps 
in cyber security either at MSIL’s end or 
at suppliers’ end may affect business 
continuity and may lead to risk of leak of 
confidential information
•	 Establishment of 
Security Operations 
Centre (SOC) to detect IT 
security incidents
•	 Implementation of 
sandboxing technology 
to ensure proactive 
malware detection 
and containment
•	 Periodic vulnerability 
assessment and 
penetration testing
•	 Use of data 
leak prevention 
and information 
rights management
•	 Regular user awareness 
programmes to 
sensitise users on 
phishing attacks
Negative

People Development
Risk
Strengthening the Capacity 
and Capability for Future 
Product Development
Globally the automobile industry is at a 
cusp of major technological transition 
driven by increasing stringency in 
product regulations, changing customer 
preferences and increasing competitive 
intensity. To meet these evolving 
conditions, strengthening the capacity 
and capability for future product 
development is critical.
•	 Skilling the employees 
on new and 
advanced technologies
•	 Measures to motivate 
and retain talent
•	 Separate organisation 
to work towards the 
measures required to 
achieve the goals for 
FY 2030-31.

Product and process 
emissions reduction
Opportunity
The average carbon emissions of the 
Company’s fleet are one of the lowest 
in the country. By placing emphasis on 
multiple powertrain technologies ranging 
from Hybrids to CNG technology to 
highly fuel-efficient ICEs, the Company’s 
fleet emit lower carbon emissions. 
Going ahead, to further support the 
journey towards decarbonisation, 
in addition to Introducing Electric 
vehicles, the Company is also working 
on use of Biofuels such as ethanol, 
compressed biogas. The emphasis 
on multiple technologies towards 
decarbonisation will help towards societal 
development by benefitting farmers and 
agrarian economy.
On reducing process emissions in 
manufacturing and vehicle dispatches, 
the Company will continue to increase its 
reliance on renewable energy and use of 
railways for vehicle dispatches.
Positive
7
Effective and 
efficient use of 
natural resources
Opportunity
One of the enablers of the Company’s 
value creation is maximising the overall 
resource efficiency, thus leading to 
responsible consumption of finite 
materials. The Company actively practices 
aspects related to the circular economy 
such as eliminating
waste, deploying the 3Rs (Reduce, Reuse, 
and Recycle) principle and maximising the 
use of renewable energy

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, 
targets, and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
	
I am pleased to present MSIL’s performance on the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) practices as detailed in 
the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report for FY 2023-24.
	
MISL looks forward to working along with its stakeholders in its growth journey towards achieving 4 million production 
capacity milestone by the year 2030-31. In this journey, the Company is aware of its responsibilities towards the environment 
and society.
	
As a responsible Corporate, Maruti Suzuki is formulating its strategies to align with Government of India’s road map of Net 
Zero besides strengthening social performance and governance structure.
	
Maruti Suzuki is exploring multiple options to minimise carbon emissions emanating from its business operations, value chain 
and use of products.
	
The Company believes that collaboration and cooperation among various stakeholders is needed to find implementable and 
financially viable alternatives to existing sources of emissions.
	
The Company is undertaking projects to replace hydrocarbon-based process fuels. At Manesar plant, a food waste and 
Napier grass-based biogas plant has been set up with a capacity of 0.2 tons of biogas daily.
	
At the manufacturing locations and R&D Centre, the Company has set up captive solar plants to increase share of renewable 
energy in the overall energy consumption besides continued focus on energy efficiency initiatives. These initiatives will help 
reduce the Company’s Scope 1 & 2 emissions.
	
In automobile manufacturing, over 90% of emissions are generated outside the OEM plant boundaries, mainly during value 
chain operations and use of products. The Company is undertaking projects to promote material circularity in partnership with 
suppliers. Expansion of ELV scrapping facilities and material circularity will be the focus areas for the Company going forward.
	
On the products front, the Company is offering multiple fuel options and technologies including petrol, CNG, and hybrid (mild 
and strong) besides preparing for the launch of its first electric vehicle.
	
The Company is undertaking concerted efforts to promote gender diversity, safety, human rights and grievance redressal at 
the workplace. The CSR initiatives in the areas of skill development, road safety and village development are being expanded 
to benefit larger sections of society.

Competition 
Commission of India 
(CCI)
Case related to after-market sale of spare parts: An investigation was 
initiated by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) in 2011 against a 
few car manufacturing companies wherein it was contended that these 
companies were not making genuine spare parts of automobiles freely 
available in the open market. CCI later expanded the scope of investigation 
to the Company and other car manufacturing companies. In the final order 
passed by the CCI on 25th August 2014, certain directions were laid down 
against the automobile companies and penalties were imposed. A penalty 
of I 4,711.4 million was imposed on the Company. The Company contested 
this matter before the Delhi High Court primarily on the ground that it was 
not a named party in the investigation and that the investigation ought not to 
have been conducted against the Company. On the contrary, the Company 
was named in the information given by the informant as a Company that 
made spare parts easily accessible in the open market. The Delhi High

Assurance process
As part of the assurance process, a multi-disciplinary team of assurance specialists performed assurance work for the selected 
sites of MSIL. We adopted a risk-based approach, that is, we concentrated our assurance efforts on the issues of high material 
relevance to the Company’s business and its key stakeholders. We carried out the following activities:

Reviewed the disclosures across BRSR Core, encompassing the 
framework for assurance consisting of a set of Key Performance 
Indicators (KPIs) under 9 ESG attributes. The format of BRSR Core 
used as basis of reasonable level of assurance
Reviewed the disclosures under BRSR reporting guidelines. Our 
focus included general disclosures, management processes, 
principle wise performance (essential indicators, and leadership 
indicators) and any other key metrics specified under the reporting 
framework. The BRSR reporting format used as basis of limited 
level of assurance.
Evaluation of the design and implementation of key systems, 
processes and controls for collecting, managing and reporting the 
BRSR Core indicators
Understanding the key systems, processes and controls for 
collecting, managing and reporting the non-financial disclosures in 
BRSR report.
Assessment of operational control and reporting boundaries
Walk-through of key data sets. Understand and test, on a sample 
basis, the processes used to adhere to and evaluate adherence to 
the reporting principles.
Seek extensive evidence across all relevant areas, ensuring a 
detailed examination of BRSR Core indicators. Engaged directly 
with stakeholders to gather insights and corroborative evidence for 
each disclosed indicator.
Collect and evaluate documentary evidence and management 
representations supporting adherence to the reporting principles.

management of disclosures and review of selected evidence to 
support environmental KPIs and metrics disclosed the Report. 
We were free to choose interviewees and interviewed those with 
overall responsibility of monitoring, data collation and reporting the 
selected indicators.

DNV audit team conducted on-site audits for data testing and also, 
to assess the uniformity in reporting processes and also, quality 
checks at different locations of the Company. Sites for data testing 
and reporting system checks were selected based on the %age 
contribution each site makes to the reported indicator, complexity 
of operations at each location (high/low/medium) and reporting 
system within the organization. Sites selected for audits are listed 
in Annex-II.
DNV audit team conducted on-site audits for corporate offices and 
sites. Sample based assessment of site-specific data disclosures 
was carried out. We were free to choose sites for conducting 
our assessment.
Conduct a comprehensive examination of key material aspects 
within the BRSR Core framework supporting adherence to the 
assurance based on applicable principles plus specified data 
and information.
Reviewed 
the 
process 
of 
reporting 
as 
defined 
in 
the 
assessment criteria.
In both the cases, DNV teams conducted the:
•	 Verification of the data consolidation of reported performance disclosures in context to the Principle of Completeness.
•	 Verification of the consolidated reported performance disclosures in context to the Principle of Completeness as per 
VeriSustainTM for both reasonable level and limited level verification for the disclosures.
Conclusion
Reasonable level of Assurance- BRSR Core indicators
Based on our review and procedures followed for reasonable level of assurance, DNV is of the opinion that, in all material aspects, 
the BRSR indicators across 9 core attributes (as listed in Annex I of this statement) for FY 2023-24 are reported in accordance 
with reporting requirements outlined in BRSR Core (Annexure I of SEBI Circular dated 12th July 2023).
Limited Level of Assurance- other disclosures in BRSR
On the basis of the assessment undertaken, nothing has come to our attention to suggest that the disclosures do not properly 
adhere to the reporting requirements as per BRSR reporting guidelines (Annexure II of SEBI Circular).
Statement of Competence and Independence
DNV applies its own management standards and compliance policies for quality control, which are based on the principles enclosed 
within ISO IEC 17029:2019 – Conformity assessment – General principles are requirements for validation and verification bodies, 
and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding 
compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards, and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
We have complied with the DNV Code of Conduct during the assurance engagement and maintain independence wherever required 
by relevant ethical requirements. This engagement work was carried out by an independent team of sustainability assurance 
professionals. During the reporting period i.e. FY 2023-24, DNV, to the best of its knowledge, was not involved in any non-audit/
non-assurance work with the Company and its Group entities which could lead to any Conflict of Interest. DNV was not involved in 
the preparation of any statements or data included in the Report except for this Assurance Statement for internal use of MSIL. DNV 
maintains complete impartiality toward stakeholders interviewed during the assurance process. We did not provide any services 
to MSIL in the scope of assurance for the reporting period that could compromise the independence or impartiality of our work.
