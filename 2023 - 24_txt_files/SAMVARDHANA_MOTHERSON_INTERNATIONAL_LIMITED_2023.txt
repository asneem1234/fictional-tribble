exist for all types of waste, and use of recycled materials and packaging is adopted wherever possible. For locations where such 
facilities do not exist then all waste is disposed of in compliance with regulatory requirements.

Motherson has implemented a range of mechanisms to receive and address grievances across the organization. Employees have 
multiple pathways to submit suggestions, including online portals, physical suggestion boxes, and Key Performance Indicators 
(KPIs) that encourage employee feedback. In cases of employee disciplinary matters, there are appeal processes outlined in 
policies, procedures, collective agreements, industry awards, and union processes.
Motherson has established various working groups, such as employee consultative committees, unionmanagement committees, 
health and safety committees, canteen committees, and welfare committees, to address employee matters.
To facilitate confidential submissions, mechanisms for anonymous or private submissions include designated email addresses 
and/or telephone numbers. Trade unions play a visible role in resolving grievances where they are present. Motherson follows an 
open-door policy, granting all employees access to senior management, regardless of their role or position within the organization.
Additionally, Motherson has a formal Whistle-Blower Policy, providing a confidential platform for reporting grievances, which 
are subsequently investigated. The Company also has a comprehensive policy on the prevention, prohibition, and redressal of 
sexual harassment in the workplace. Many of Motherson’s Indian units have Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs) in compliance 
with the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition, and Redressal) Act, 2013. The ICC members are 
responsible for conducting inquiries related to such complaints.

Health and safety management system:
a. 
Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity?
Yes. ISO45001/ISO18001 certified health and safety management systems are in place across the majority of Motherson’s 
operations. Alternative ISO-compliant health and safety management systems are in place in situations where these particular 
certifications have not been obtained. Motherson follows the exacting standards established by FM Global, a renowned 
international insurer, in addition to the ISO guidelines. FM Global is renowned for its proficiency in the development of safety 
standards and work practices, as well as operational risk management, which includes fire management systems.
Motherson places a high priority on the health, safety, and well-being of its workers and seeks to establish a secure working 
environment throughout all of its operations by abiding by these globally recognized standards and practices.
b. 
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by the 
entity? 
At Motherson, we identify and evaluate risks and hazards in a proactive manner. We use a range of techniques to guarantee 
a thorough assessment of potential risks and related hazards.
1. 
Carrying out safety inspection walks, in which authorised workers examine the workplace to find any potential or 
current hazards. In order to systematically evaluate risks across a range of activities and processes, we also schedule 
risk assessments. Inspections are conducted on a regular basis to track continued adherence to safety procedures and 
spot any new risks.
2. 
We carry out monthly and quarterly audits, which entail a detailed examination of hazard identification and risk 
assessment inputs, in order to uphold a high standard of safety. This makes it possible for us to keep enhancing our 
safety procedures and guarantee that any hazards are dealt with right away.
3. 
We give regular and planned preventative maintenance top priority when it comes to our plants and equipment. This 
lessens the possibility of hazards brought on by equipment failures or malfunctions.
c. 
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work related hazards and to remove themselves from such risks. 
Yes, a system has been put in place for all employees to report hazards and get them resolved quickly. People can report 
any possible hazards they come across at work thanks to this system. Our goal is to establish a culture of proactive risk 
identification and mitigation of safety issues by actively promoting hazard reporting.

d. 
Do the employees/ worker of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services?
Yes We have partnerships with panel hospitals to guarantee that workers can easily access healthcare facilities for their 
requirements.
In certain locations, we also have medical professionals on-site who can offer immediate medical attention and support within our 
premises. These professionals may include doctors, nurses, and/or physiotherapists. Our employees are guaranteed timely and 
effective healthcare services thanks to our on-site presence.

Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy work place.
A safe and healthy workplace is ensured by the existing health and safety management systems. This method emphasizes the 
value of teamwork in preserving safety and entails active engagement from shop floor employees up to management. Numerous 
initiatives are put into place to deal with risk assessment and hazard identification. These programs are implemented through pre-
activity and scheduled evaluations in addition to on-demand work. In order to put in place the proper control measures, the goal 
is to methodically identify potential hazards and evaluate the risks connected with them. Worker, employee, and management 
representation is essential in health and safety committees. These committees serve as forums for talking about risk and hazard 
management, health and wellness programs, emergency response plans, and local law compliance. Together with the general 
management systems, the committees guarantee a thorough approach to health and safety.

Provide details of any corrective action taken or underway to address safety-related incidents (if any) and on significant risks / 
concerns arising from assessments of health & safety practices and working conditions.
At Motherson, a number of safety-related upgrades have been made. One way to prevent access to areas where there is a risk of 
equipment movement is by installing safety devices and systems in equipment, such as automatic and semi-automatic presses. 
By cutting off power in dangerous situations, safety measures like interlocks, presence curtains, security guards, and equipment 
programming help guarantee the safety of workers. Procedures for authorization have been designed for high-risk tasks like 
electrical installations, height work, and hot work. Additional measures include adhering to relevant legal requirements, offering 
workers induction courses on safety, health, and the environment, supplying the proper personal protective equipment for each 
activity, carrying out safety audits while in operation, and keeping nurses and doctors on hand to offer emergency care.
The purpose of the monthly safety committee meetings is to review and discuss any incidents involving safety that happened 
during the previous month and the steps taken to avoid similar incidents in the future. The availability and discussion of safety-
related key performance indicators (KPIs) at monthly performance review meetings facilitates the tracking and enhancement of 
safety performance. Every unit has dedicated incident investigation teams that are in charge of looking into any incidents and 
coming up with corrective measures to stop them from happening again.

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases.
Motherson has a Prevention of Harassment Policy https://www.motherson.com/storage/Group-Policies/Prevention-of-
Harassment-Policy.pdf that strictly prohibits retaliation or victimization of individuals who seek redressal against all acts of 
harassment. The policy ensures that if a complaint is found to be true by the Reporting Authority, appropriate remedial action will 
be taken as prescribed in paragraph 7 of the policy.
The identity of the Reporting Person is kept confidential, and retaliation is strictly prohibited in accordance with the Code of Conduct 
for Employees and Whistleblower Policies. Motherson maintains a ‘zero tolerance’ approach towards any form of harassment in the 
workplace, and every individual is responsible for ensuring their actions and behaviors are free from harassment.
The Motherson Prevention of Harassment Policy serves as the foundation for preventing harassment within the organization. 
Each entity within Motherson is required to establish a complaints committee that is responsible for receiving, investigating, and 
submitting findings for each case, while maintaining strict confidentiality to the fullest extent possible. Any form of retaliation or 
victimization against the aggrieved person is strictly prohibited.
In addition to the group policy and procedure, Motherson also complies with local regulatory requirements concerning retaliation 
and victimization, further reinforcing its commitment to preventing harassment and fostering a safe and respectful work 
environment.

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your company 
to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such 
wastes.
Waste is genertaed from production processes and inbound packaging, as well as general operational activity including 
maintenance.
At every site, production waste is monitored and reported on a monthly basis with the objective to minimise and reduce whereever 
possible. Any production waste produced is kept clearly segregated from general waste and is recycled wherever possible. The 
level of recycling infrastructure varies in different countries around the world.
General waste is always segregated between hazardous and non-hazardous materials, and is always disposed off in accordance 
with local legislation. What materials may be recycled using locally available facilities is appropriately done so
