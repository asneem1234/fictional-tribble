The Olectra electric buses has successfully completed more than 20 crores kms on Indian roads which is 
equivalent to saving around 5.33 crore liters of diesel i.e. a direct saving of fuel cost by Rs. 506.35 crores. 
With such operations of electric buses, approximately 1,42,844 tons of carbon emissions in the public 
transport segment in India has been avoided, which is equivalent to planting around 8.55 Lakh trees.
 	
As on 31st March 2024; Olectra has delivered 1,695 buses to 16 various State Transport Undertakings 
and Corporations. The operations of these electric buses not only reduced the carbon footprints but it has 
also been a sustainable ecosystem in public mobility. The cost-effectiveness in comparison to the regular 
151

diesel buses has promoted adoption of electric buses amongst various government and non-government 
agencies. The design of the electric buses is in tune with international standards. The buses reduce the use 
of fossil fuels leading to a reduction of CO2 emissions and offering a cost-effective mobility to the public.

10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the 
strategy adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your 
products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
	
Olectra adopts the 5R principles (Reduce, Reuse, Re-cycle, Redesign & Regulate) in waste detection. Under 
the said principal, Olectra undertakes the following efforts:
 
l	
Reduce: Optimizes the usage of material using resources more efficiently, and avoiding unnecessary 
consumption.
 
l	
Reuse: Promotes reuse of items instead of disposing of them after a single use helps to conserve 
resources and reduce waste. This can involve using items multiple times for the same or different 
purposes. Eg: AC frames & Battery frames
 
l	
Recycle: Send back certain items to our suppliers to recycle (materials like paper, plastics, metals etc.) 
which they reuse in the product packages etc. Eg: Racks, Stands, Worktables & internal visual boards 
 
l	
Redesign: Redesign products and systems to minimize waste and environmental impact. This involves 
using eco-friendly materials, designing products which are more durable and easier to repair, 
creating systems that generate less waste throughout their lifecycle. Designing for sustainability aims 
to integrate environmental considerations into product development and manufacturing processes. 
Eg: FRP Material
 
l	
Regulate: Comply with the regulatory standards, provide incentives for environmentally friendly 
practices, and ensure compliance with environmental laws. Eg: we control the open paint activities, 
spillage of coolant & provide provision in bins and metal pallets.
At the shop floor the waste is segregate into hazardous & non-hazardous category and then transported 
to designated collection areas.
	
a)	
Hazardous waste (Sealant foils, mixed paint & paint accessories, Expired sealant, paint filters, broken 
glass) is disposed off to an authorized vendor (Resistibility limited) - This vendor is authorized by 
TSPCB. 
	
b)	
Non-Hazardous is directly collected & transferred to the authorized vendors.
