RISK
The Company’s only limited activities poses
risks to the local environment and surrounding
communities, including biodiversity impacts,
emissions into the air, water discharges,
natural resource consumption, and waste
generation. Managing and accessing these
environmental risks are crucial to avoid
potential legal and reputational issues.
OPPORTUNITY
There are opportunities for the Company to
address these risks and enhance its
reputation by implementing sustainable
construction 
practices, 
conducting
comprehensive environmental impact
assessments, engaging stakeholders, and
investing in innovation and research. By
embracing these opportunities, the Company
can minimize negative environmental
impacts, comply with regulations, and position
itself as a responsible and sustainable leader
in the industry.
The identification of energy management as
an opportunity for the Company stems from
the potential benefits of enhancing overall
energy efficiency, diversifying energy sources,
and accessing alternative and renewable
energy. By implementing energy-efficient
technologies and systems, the Company can
reduce costs, improve operational efficiency,
and mitigate the risks associated with energy
price fluctuations. Furthermore, the
installation of a rooftop solar power plant
demonstrates the Company’s commitment to
renewable energy, which not only reduces
dependence on conventional sources but also
aligns with sustainability goals. Embracing
energy management as an opportunity can
enhance competitiveness, contribute to a
greener future, and strengthen the Company’s
environmental stewardship.
The Company is actively mitigating
the risk associated with footprints of
operations by:
•
Implementing 
robust
environmental management
systems;
•
Conducting 
regular
assessments; and
•
Adopting sustainable practices
through responsible resource
consumption, waste reduction
initiatives, and stakeholder
engagement.
-
NEGATIVE
The financial implications of the identified risk
include potential negative impacts such as
increased costs for addressing environmental
issues, potential fines or penalties for non-
compliance with regulations, and potential legal
expenses. These financial implications can lead
to a decrease in profitability and cash flow if
adequate measures are not taken to manage and
mitigate environmental risks.
POSITIVE
Implementing sustainable construction practices
and effectively managing environmental risks can
enhance the Company’s reputation and
attractiveness to environmentally conscious
clients and partners. This can lead to increased
business opportunities, a competitive edge in
obtaining new projects, and potentially higher
project value. Additionally, proactive engagement
with stakeholders and investment in research and
innovation can drive efficiency, cost savings, and
long-term financial sustainability.
POSITIVE
By enhancing overall energy efficiency, the
Company can reduce energy consumption and
associated costs, leading to potential cost savings
and improved profitability. Diversifying energy
sources and accessing alternative and renewable
energy can also contribute to long-term financial
sustainability by mitigating the risks of energy
price fluctuations and reducing reliance on
conventional energy sources. Additionally,
investing in renewable energy initiatives, such as
the rooftop solar power plant, may provide
opportunities for incentives, subsidies, and long-
term cost savings through reduced energy bills.
Overall, effective energy management can
positively impact the Company’s financial
performance and enhance its competitive position
in the market.

Risk &
Development
Opportunity
The Company has categorized waste
management as an opportunity by
implementing 
responsible 
waste
management practices, such as minimizing
waste 
generation 
and 
ensuring
environmentally responsible disposal.
Through meticulous waste segregation, reuse
of materials within its operations, and
responsible disposal through approved
vendors, the Company aims to minimize its
environmental footprint, conserve resources,
and comply with regulatory requirements. This
commitment 
to 
sustainable 
waste
management not only reduces potential
negative impacts but also presents
opportunities for cost savings, resource
efficiency, and enhanced environmental
stewardship.
The 
categorization 
of 
Community
Development (Human Rights & Community
Relations) as both a risk and an opportunity
stem from the potential impacts of the
Company’s long-term construction activities
on local communities. Risks include
community dissatisfaction and potential legal
issues arising from environmental and social
impacts.
On the other hand, the opportunity lies in
engaging with stakeholders and prioritizing
community interests to foster positive
relationships, obtain a social license to
operate, enhance the Company’s reputation,
and drive long-term business sustainability.
-
The Company is committed to
mitigating the risk associated with
Community Development by:
•
Promoting 
community
development;
•
Respecting human rights; and
•
Fostering strong community
relations.
POSITIVE
By minimizing waste generation and promoting
resource efficiency, the Company can reduce
waste disposal costs, optimize material usage,
and potentially generate revenue through the sale
of reusable materials. Furthermore, complying
with regulatory requirements mitigates the risk of
fines and legal liabilities, while demonstrating a
commitment to sustainable practices can enhance
the Company’s reputation, attract environmentally
conscious clients, and contribute to long-term
financial sustainability.
NEGATIVE
Negative impacts such as community
dissatisfaction, legal issues, and reputational
damage can result in increased costs, potential
litigation expenses, and a loss of business
opportunities. 
Additionally, 
addressing
environmental and social impacts may require
additional investments in mitigation measures,
potentially impacting profitability and cash flow in
the short term.
POSITIVE
By prioritizing community engagement, respecting
human rights, and obtaining a social license to
operate, the Company can benefit from enhanced
reputation and community support. This can lead
to increased customer loyalty, attracting socially
conscious investors, and opening doors to
potential 
partnerships 
and 
business
collaborations. The positive financial implications
may include improved long-term profitability,
access to new markets, and cost savings through
streamlined operations and reduced conflicts with
local communities.

Materials
Opportunity
Sourcing
The categorization of Workforce Health and
Safety as a risk is based on the high fatality
and injury rates in the EPC industry compared
to other sectors, as well as the increased
vulnerability of temporary workers due to lack
of training and experience. Failing to
effectively manage these risks can result in
human suffering, legal liabilities, and financial
costs.
The categorization of Materials Sourcing as
an opportunity is based on the potential to
reduce direct and indirect greenhouse gas
emissions and integrate value chain partner
considerations effectively into the Company’s
business strategy. By strategically selecting
suppliers with lower carbon footprints,
promoting sustainable practices, and
incorporating responsible supply chain
management, the Company can enhance its
environmental 
reputation, 
attract
environmentally conscious customers, and
meet the growing demand for sustainable
products and services. This opportunity aligns
with environmental sustainability goals,
enhances operational efficiency, and
positively impacts the Company’s long-term
financial performance.
The Company prioritizes workforce
health and safety by:
•
Implementing comprehensive
safety protocols;
•
Providing regular training
programs, and fostering a
strong safety culture;
•
Conducting risk assessments,
ensuring compliance with
occupational health and safety
regulations; and
•
Continuously monitoring and
improving safety practices.
-
NEGATIVE
Workplace accidents and injuries can result in
increased costs, including medical expenses,
compensation claims, potential legal liabilities,
and regulatory fines. Additionally, such incidents
can lead to project delays, increased insurance
premiums, and reputational damage, impacting
the Company’s profitability and hindering its ability
to secure future projects
POSITIVE
By strategically selecting suppliers with lower
carbon footprints and incorporating sustainable
practices, the Company can potentially reduce
costs associated with energy consumption, waste
management, and compliance with environmental
regulations. Furthermore, meeting the growing
demand for sustainable products and services can
open new market opportunities, attract
environmentally conscious customers, and
strengthen the Company’s competitive position.
Additionally, a positive environmental reputation
can enhance brand value and customer loyalty,
leading to increased sales and long-term financial
sustainability.

Processes in place to reclaim products for reuse, recycle and safe disposal of products at the end of life:
Cable Business:
The Company ensures that the cables supplied to customers possess a minimum lifespan of 25-
30 years. To ensure transparency and proper handling of end-of-life treatment, customers are
provided with a comprehensive Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) that contains detailed
information on the appropriate procedures for disposal or treatment.
Given that the cables are predominantly utilized by industrial entities, the responsibility for the
effective management of end-of-life treatment lies with the customers themselves. This entails
adhering to the guidelines specified in the MSDS and complying with the relevant laws and
regulations in force during that period.
Regarding waste generated within the Company, stringent measures are implemented to ensure
compliance with environmental laws and consent conditions. Specific waste categories are handled
as follows:
•
Plastic Waste: The Company responsibly sells plastic waste to authorized recyclers, thereby
promoting sustainable waste management practices.
•
E-Waste: In line with regulatory requirements, the Company sells electronic waste exclusively
to authorized recyclers, ensuring proper recycling and disposal.
•
Acid Batteries: The Company follows a buy-back policy with Original Equipment Manufacturers
(OEMs) to ensure the safe and environmentally sound disposal of acid batteries.
•
Hazardous Waste: All hazardous waste generated is meticulously disposed of through
authorized recyclers, adhering to strict guidelines and safety protocols.
•
Other Non-Hazardous Waste: The Company adopts a responsible approach by selling non-
hazardous waste to trusted vendors who can appropriately handle and utilize the materials.
