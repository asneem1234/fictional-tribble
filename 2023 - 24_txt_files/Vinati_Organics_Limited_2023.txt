1.
Climate Change 
Management
Risk
Considering the negative 
impacts of chemical 
manufacturing processes 
on the environment and 
ecosystem, it becomes 
imperative to take steps 
towards making overall 
business operations, 
climate-resilient. 
Additionally, the risk of 
sustaining a company’s 
reputation in the global 
market demands 
attention.
As a leading company, 
we recognize the 
urgent need to align our 
business practices and 
operations with the global 
commitments to address 
climate change. Our 
unwavering dedication to 
sustainability is reflected 
in the certifications and 
accreditations we have 
obtained, including the ISO 
14001 (EMS), ISO 45001 
(OHSAS) and Responsible 
Care certifications, as 
well as our Gold Rating 
in EcoVadis. These 
achievements demonstrate 
our commitment to 
maintaining safe, 
sustainable, and pollution-
free operations.
Negative financial 
implications from 
investment for 
implementing climate 
actions as identified by the 
organizations.
Positive impact in the long 
run due to climate change 
management and lower 
operational expenditure.
2.
Energy 
Management
Risk/
Opportunity
Energy generation 
through non-renewable 
resources results in 
the release of harmful 
emissions into the 
atmosphere and is 
a direct contributor 
to greenhouse gas 
emissions. The major 
energy demand of the 
Company processes 
is met through coal, 
resulting in a high risk 
of managing the energy 
demand.
To further our efforts in 
reducing our climate 
impact, we have embarked 
on a journey to ensure 
the efficient use of 
natural resources and the 
reduced consumption of 
fossil fuels. This includes 
the implementation of a 
co-generation system for 
energy production, which 
provides both steam and 
power, as well as the 
commissioning of solar 
plants with a combined 
capacity of 26 MW. 
Currently, 44% of our total 
electricity consumption is 
met through renewable 
energy sources, and we 
are committed to increasing 
this percentage through 
the commissioning of an 
additional 6 MW solar plant 
during the fiscal year 2024-
25.
Negative financial 
implication due to required 
investment in renewable 
energy sources.
Positive impact in the long 
run due to energy security 
and lower operational 
expenditure.

3.
Materials
Risk
The Company uses 
Toluene, Propylene, 
Methyl Tert Butyl Ether, 
Acrylonitrile, water, 
and coal, as major raw 
materials/resources. 
Hence, these have a 
direct impact and result 
in natural resource 
depletion. Risks arising 
due to climate change 
can affect the Company’s 
supply chain and 
business.
Recognizing the importance 
of sustainable procurement, 
we have adopted a policy 
that emphasizes the 
purchase of goods and 
services with minimum 
strain on natural resources. 
Furthermore, we are 
actively exploring circularity 
measures by increasing the 
efficiency of our processes 
and optimizing the inputs 
used through continuous 
innovation efforts, thereby 
achieving material 
efficiency.
Positive financial 
implication through the 
use of optimum, efficient, 
and recycled input 
materials.
4.
Waste 
Management
Risk
Regulatory compliance, 
increased health risks 
of the community, and 
moral obligation to 
protect the environment 
make it essential for 
safe and sound waste 
management. This is 
essential to eliminate 
waste stream interference 
with ecosystems and 
damage caused.
To manage our waste 
streams effectively, we 
have installed a Zero Liquid 
Discharge system in one of 
our plant and other 2 plants 
have minimal discharge. 
We have Effluent Treatment 
Plants (ETPs) at all our 
facilities. Hazardous waste 
is responsibly managed 
by authorized Treatment, 
Storage, and Disposal 
Facilities (TSDF), while fly 
ash bricks are sent for co-
processing to be used in 
the production of bricks by 
the local community.
Negative financial 
implications from the 
operation of Treatment 
infrastructure and 
association with waste 
management facilities.
Positive impact as risk 
mitigation will lead to 
productivity enhancement 
due to increased yields.
5.
Water 
Stewardship
Risk
Water consumption for 
industrial operations 
leads to a reduction 
in the overall volume 
of the water available. 
Water source depletion 
has a wider impact 
on the quality of life 
of communities and 
surrounding ecosystems.
Conscious of the need 
to manage natural 
water resources, we 
have installed rainwater 
harvesting systems to 
replenish the water table 
and reverse osmosis (RO) 
systems to ensure the 
efficient utilization of water. 
Our constant efforts to 
reduce water withdrawal, 
consumption, and wastage 
have helped us maintain a 
sustainable balance.
Negative financial 
implications for creating 
water harvesting 
infrastructure and installing 
water-efficient systems.

6.
Customer 
Relationship
Risk
Exporting a major quantity 
of products overseas 
makes timely delivery 
very crucial for the 
Company. Maintaining 
the Quality of products 
with their affordability 
is a fundamental need 
for improving customer 
relationships.
Alongside our 
environmental initiatives, 
we prioritize customer 
satisfaction and have 
deployed account 
managers to address 
queries from each 
customer account. We 
have also implemented a 
comprehensive feedback 
collection system and 
review mechanism to 
continuously improve the 
customer experience.
The positive financial 
implication of market 
growth.
7.
Human Capital 
Management 
- Equal 
Opportunity, 
Diversity & 
Inclusion, 
Retention 
Strategy & 
Training
Risk
Right talent and capacity 
building on best practices 
in chemical manufacturing 
is important to 
understanding equipment 
& machinery function 
knowledge and adopting 
safety and care in 
handling & transporting 
chemicals.
Internally, we have 
adopted a policy of 
zero discrimination 
and equal opportunity 
for our employees 
regarding recruitment and 
compensation, based on 
industry standards. We 
place great importance 
on employee health 
and safety, providing 
regular EHS training and 
behavioural sessions at our 
manufacturing facilities.
Negative financial 
implications from 
investments in training, 
skill development, and 
implementation of HR 
policies
Positive impact due to 
higher productivity.
8.
Human Rights
Risk
Human Rights are 
an important aspect 
for companies in the 
chemical sector. Activities 
included in the value 
chain like extraction of 
raw materials, loading 
& transportation as 
well as manufacturing 
of the chemicals may 
result in exposure to 
harmful radiation as 
well as exploitation of 
human rights in terms of 
employment conditions 
and low wages. This 
may result in a loss 
of reputation for the 
Company as well as a 
harmful impact on the 
workforce.
We have a zero-tolerance 
policy against child 
labour, forced labour, or 
involuntary labour, and we 
have implemented policies 
addressing issues such 
as sexual harassment, 
vendor and contractor 
engagement, and 
stakeholder engagement. 
No grievances were raised 
for human rights violations 
during the reporting period.
Negative implications 
are observed as the 
risk mitigation requires 
effort and capital to 
follow compliance with 
fundamental human rights.

Local Community 
Engagement
Opportunity/
Risk
Risk: Chemical 
manufacturing involves 
producing harmful 
effluents & gases as 
byproducts which may 
negatively impact the 
local surroundings. It may 
lead to long-term health 
and ecological impacts if 
not managed properly.
Opportunity: Engagement 
with local communities 
helps in earning goodwill 
and trust building. Hiring 
from local areas can 
promote employment and 
provide cheap labour.
Recognizing our 
responsibility to the local 
communities in which 
we operate, we regularly 
engage with them to 
understand their needs 
and expectations, ensuring 
that our operations are 
in harmony with the 
surrounding environment. 
We have undertaken 
various initiatives in the 
fields of rural development, 
drinking water projects, 
solar street water pumps, 
and women’s education, 
among others, while also 
utilizing the services of local 
contractors and service 
providers to the best 
possible extent.
Positive impact due to 
goodwill, reputation, and 
inclusive growth.
10.
Occupational 
Health and Safety
Risk
Occupational Health & 
Safety is an aspect that 
is very crucial since the 
nature of business deals 
in the manufacturing of 
hazardous chemicals. 
These conditions 
predispose employees 
toward safety hazards.
Workplace health 
and safety is a crucial 
component of our Human 
Rights and Labor Policy, 
and we are proud to be 
Responsible Care company 
and ISO 45001:2018 
certified, ensuring a 
robust environment 
management system. We 
provide comprehensive 
EHS training to our 
manufacturing plant 
employees to protect them 
from potential hazards.
Negative impact due to 
increased operational 
cost incurred on safety 
training, protective gears, 
and increased capital 
expenditure on ensuring 
asset integrity.
11.
Stakeholder 
Engagement
Opportunity
The involvement 
and agreement of 
stakeholders eliminate 
the chances of conflicts 
and increase productivity.
To maintain transparency 
and accountability, 
we collaborate with 
institutions and regulators 
periodically, and we have 
a whistleblower policy 
in place to keep our 
management activities in 
check. We communicate 
with our stakeholders 
through our annual report, 
newspaper publications, 
and our website.
Positive impact due to 
reputation, goodwill, and 
increased productivity of 
employees.

Business 
Continuity 
Planning
Risk
Owing to uncertain 
situations, increased 
physical risk apparently 
due to climate change, 
hazards associated with 
chemical manufacturing, 
and man-made disasters, 
it is crucial for an 
organization to have 
robust business continuity 
planning.
To ensure digital 
continuity in the face of 
any physical risks related 
to climate change, we 
have implemented robust 
backup IT systems on 
the cloud, providing a 
reliable safeguard for our 
operations.
Negative Financial 
implications from IT 
infrastructure setup
13.
Compliance 
(Environment & 
Regulatory)
Risk
The external regulatory 
environment is dynamic. 
Compliance with relevant 
environmental and 
financial laws is most 
critical for business 
continuity and to avoid 
any fine/penalty that 
directly impacts the 
organization’s reputation.
Our steadfast commitment 
to sustainable 
business practices and 
environmental and social 
responsibility is evident 
in the comprehensive 
measures we have 
implemented across our 
operations. By aligning 
our practices with 
global climate change 
commitments, we are 
setting a benchmark for 
responsible corporate 
citizenship and paving the 
way for a more sustainable 
future.
Negative financial 
implications from 
compliance team 
deployment and 
implementing prescribed 
requirements.
14.
Data Privacy & 
Cyber Security
Risk
Data privacy and cyber 
security have emerged 
as a major threat to 
business operations. Data 
breach of the Company’s 
Information Technology 
systems leads to business 
damage and reputational 
risk, causing damage at 
both financial and non-
financial ends.
In today’s digital landscape, 
safeguarding sensitive 
data and ensuring robust 
cyber security measures 
have become paramount 
for organizations across 
industries. The Company, 
with its diversified 
specialty chemicals 
manufacturing operations, 
has recognized the critical 
importance of implementing 
comprehensive data 
privacy and cyber security 
protocols.
Negative implication due 
to cost incurred on the 
purchase of hardware 
and software needed for 
data security management 
system.

underscore the Company’s 
financial strength, with a 
long-term rating of AA for 
its bank facilities and a 
short-term rating of A1+ for 
its short-term bank facilities.
Positive impact due to 
growing global market and 
exports
16.
Ethical Business 
Conduct
Risk
Adherence to ethics and 
transparency in their 
day-to-day business 
operations at all levels is 
crucial for the Company. 
They have to abide by 
local, national & global 
norms of business. Failing 
to adhere to fair business 
practices can lead to 
penalties, sanctions, and 
revenue loss.
The Company has 
implemented robust 
control measures to 
ensure ethical conduct 
and prevent undesirable 
practices. The Whistle 
Blower Policy and a Code 
of Conduct underscores the 
organization’s commitment 
to upholding high standards 
of business integrity. All 
Directors, KMP’s, and 
employees undergo 
comprehensive training 
to ensure their adherence 
to ethical business 
practices. Furthermore, 
the Company has 
established comprehensive 
systems and processes 
to ensure the ethical and 
equitable execution of its 
operations. Additionally, 
the organization requires 
annual independence 
declarations from its 
directors and KMP to 
mitigate any potential 
conflicts of interest.
Negative implication 
due to cost incurred on 
systems and processes to 
ensure strict compliance 
with applicable/emerging 
regulations
Positive implication due to 
good customer reputation.

Risk Management
Risk/
Opportunity
Risk management helps 
in identifying & mitigating 
various factors that can 
be an inherent risk and 
can lead to financial loss 
and non-compliance. 
It also helps to identify 
potential opportunities 
which may help a 
company to diversify 
its business and avoid 
certain risks.
The Risk Management 
Committee, comprising 
members from the Board 
of Directors, is entrusted 
with the authority to 
oversee all aspects of 
risk management. This 
committee is responsible 
for identifying and 
mitigating the various 
risks that may potentially 
impede the Company’s 
ability to accomplish 
its strategic objectives, 
goals, and desired 
outcomes. It ensures 
that the organization is 
adequately prepared to 
navigate the complexities 
of the business landscape 
and maintain a robust risk 
management framework.
Positive implications are 
there due to benefits 
obtained by identifying 
certain risks and tapping 
on potential opportunities.
