 1.	 Business Ethics and Governance 
	
Risk: Failure to comply with rapidly changing regulatory requirements can result in adverse impact for the 
Company and erode stakeholders’ trust. Evolving environmental and social regulations present a risk of potential 
non-compliance which, if not met, can result in fines, penalties and adverse impact on brand reputation.
	
Rationale/ Mitigation Measures:
	
To mitigate this risk, we implement strict Code of Conduct, anti-bribery and corruption policies and procedures, 
including training for our employees on ethical business practices. Regular audits and reviews of our financial 
transactions also help identify any potential red flags and ensure compliance with laws and regulations. By taking 
these steps, we protect the Company from the negative consequences of unethical business conduct
2.	
Physical Impacts of Climate Change
	
Risk: Adapting to climate change and its associated risks is imperative for business continuity. Managing our GHG 
footprint and making focused efforts for reduced emissions reduction is critical for us to remain a sustainable 
business. Ineffective management of our GHG footprint may expose us to physical and transition risk thereby 
adversely impacting business resilience and growth.
	
Rationale/ Mitigation Measures: 1. Implement a robust data monitoring framework for external reporting 2. 
Implement interventions to bridge gaps in climate change mitigation measures, compliance gaps. 
3.	
Health and Safety
	
Risk: For real estate companies, it is essential to inherent risks associated with property management, 
construction, and maintenance activities. Providing a safe work environment and preventing accidents are 
paramount to protecting employees, contractors, and tenants from potential hazards.
	
Compliance with safety regulations is not only a legal obligation but also a critical factor in mitigating financial 
risks related to workplace injuries, liability claims, and potential fines

Rationale/ Mitigation Measures: 1. Our H&S Management system is aligned with industrial norms, conducting 
thorough audits and risk assessments. 2. Comprehensive training programs ensure staff are versed in safety 
protocols. Robust incident reporting and transparent communication foster a safety culture, while regular 
monitoring and reviews enhance effectiveness.
 4.	 Waste Management
	
Risk: Waste management poses a significant risk to real estate sectors due to the significant waste generated 
by development, operation, and demolition of properties. As environmental regulations become stricter and 
stakeholders demand more sustainable practices, effective waste management is crucial to ensure compliance, 
reduce landfill use, and lower environmental impact.
	
Rationale/ Mitigation Measures: 1. We have implemented comprehensive strategies focused on waste diversion, 
recycling, and reuse. By prioritizing the minimization of construction and operational waste sent to landfills, 
we actively reduce our environmental impact. 2. Our initiatives include robust recycling programs and onsite 
material reuse practice. 
5.	
Energy Efficiency
	
Opportunity/ Rationale: Effectively managing our energy consumption is imperative to our operational impact 
on the environment. It also enables business resilience against extreme weather events and other risks from 
climate change. Further, it also supports customer satisfaction, regulatory compliance, and financial savings.
