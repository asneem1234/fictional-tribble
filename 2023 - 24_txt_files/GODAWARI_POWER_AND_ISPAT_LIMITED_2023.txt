environment. Our H7S covers a wide range of aspects related to health and safety, including 
but not limited to: 
 
 Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment:-We regularly conduct hazard identification and 
risk assessments across all areas of our operations to identify potential risks to health and 
safety. This proactive approach allows us to implement measures to eliminate or mitigate these 
risks effectively. 
 
 Legal and Regulatory Compliance: - Our H&S ensures compliance with relevant laws, 
regulations, and industry standards related to occupational health and safety. We continuously 
monitor changes in legislation and update our practices accordingly to maintain compliance. 
 
 Safety Training and Education: - We provide comprehensive safety training and education 
programs to all employees to ensure they are equipped with the knowledge and skills 
necessary to perform their work safely. Training covers topics such as hazard recognition, 
emergency procedures, and the proper use of personal protective equipment. 
 
 Incident Reporting and Investigation: - Our H&S includes protocols for reporting and 
investigating incidents, near misses, and hazards promptly. This allows us to identify root 
causes and implement corrective actions to prevent recurrence. 
 
 Emergency Preparedness and Response: - We have established emergency preparedness and 
response plans to address various scenarios, including fires, medical emergencies, and natural 
disasters. Employees are trained on these plans and participate in drills to ensure they are 
prepared to respond effectively in case of an emergency.

potential hazards in their work areas. This includes hazards related to equipment, machinery,

communication with supervisors. 
 
 Routine Inspections: - We conduct regular inspections of our work areas to systematically 
identify and assess potential hazards. Trained personnel, often from our safety committees or 
dedicated safety teams, perform these inspections using checklists or other assessment tools 
designed to capture a wide range of hazards. These routine inspections are scheduled at 
regular intervals, ensuring that potential risks are identified and addressed promptly. 
 
 Incident Reporting and Investigation: - Our organization maintains a robust incident reporting 
system that encourages employees to report near misses, incidents, and accidents promptly. 
Each reported incident triggers a thorough investigation to determine root causes and 
contributing factors. Through these investigations, we identify any underlying hazards or 
systemic issues that may need to be addressed to prevent recurrence. 
 
 Training and Awareness: - We provide regular training and awareness programs to ensure 
that employees understand how to identify hazards and assess risks effectively. This includes 
training on hazard recognition, risk assessment methodologies, and the importance of 
proactive safety measures. By empowering employees with the knowledge and skills to 
identify and address risks, we create a culture of safety throughout our organization.

In response to safety-related incidents or concerns, our organization takes prompt and decisive 
corrective actions to address the root cause and prevent recurrence. Here are details of our approach to 
addressing such situations: 
 
 Immediate Response: - Whenever a safety-related incident occurs, our first priority is to ensure 
the well-being of those involved and to mitigate any immediate risks. This may involve providing 
medical attention, securing the area, and conducting initial investigations to understand the 
circumstances leading to the incident. 
 
 Root Cause Analysis: - Following any safety incident, we conduct thorough root cause analysis to 
identify the underlying factors contributing to the event. This analysis involves examining human 
factors, equipment failure, procedural lapses, or environmental conditions that may have played a 
role. 
 
 Corrective Actions: - Based on the findings of the root cause analysis, we develop and implement 
corrective actions to address the identified issues effectively. These actions may include revising 
procedures, enhancing training programs, repairing or replacing equipment, or making physical 
modifications to the work environment. 
 
 Communication and Training: - We ensure that all employees are informed about the incident and 
any corrective actions taken to prevent similar occurrences in the future. Additionally, targeted 
training programs may be conducted to reinforce safety protocols and best practices relevant to 
the incident.
