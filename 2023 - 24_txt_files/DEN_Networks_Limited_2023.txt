Energy 
Management
Opportunity
It is crucial for all industries 
to 
consider 
responsible 
energy management as an 
opportunity 
to 
enhance 
sustainable value creation and 
holistic performance.
DEN 
has 
implemented 
various 
measures to ensure effective energy 
management. These include practices 
such as turning off electrical appliances 
and equipment when not in use, as 
well as replacing traditional bulbs with 
energy-efficient LED bulbs in all our 
offices. Additionally, we have setup 
an alternative to DG sets by installing 
electric inverters at some of our 
locations.

Waste 
Management & 
Circular Economy
Risk and 
Opportunity
India's 
Environment 
Protection Act 1986  outlines 
guidelines for effective waste 
management 
procedures. 
Failure to adhere to these 
rules can result in penalties 
and negatively affect the 
Company's 
reputation. 
By 
adopting a circular Company's 
economy approach to waste 
management, we can reduce 
our reliance on new resources, 
leading to responsible cost 
savings.
DEN 
has 
established 
protocols 
for the safe disposal of end-of-life 
waste as well as malfunctioning and 
unusable products through certified 
e-waste recyclers, complying with 
all government regulations for safe 
e-waste disposal. Additionally, we 
promote recycling by salvaging and 
refurbishing Set Top Boxes (STBs) for 
future use.

Employee well-
being, health and 
safety
Risk
Employees play a crucial role 
in a company’s success and 
advancement. If their physical 
and mental well-being is 
not ensured, it can lead to 
a decrease in productivity, 
which can directly impact 
business 
operations 
and 
customer satisfaction.
The health and wellness of our 
employees are paramount, and we are 
dedicated to fostering an environment 
where they can thrive both personally 
and professionally. We acknowledge 
the importance of mental health in the 
overall well-being scope, and advocate 
for it in the workplace.
Additionally, 
we 
provide 
training 
on health and safety measures and 
ensure first aid and safety kits are easily 
accessible for emergencies at all our 
office premises.

Human Rights
Risk
Human rights are fundamental 
rights that apply to everyone, 
from the highest to the lowest 
levels of our organisation and 
throughout our value chain. 
Neglecting concerns or issues 
related to human rights can 
lead to operational setbacks 
and damage our reputation. 
Moreover, it could potentially 
result in regulatory action.
DEN adheres to all laws and regulations 
aimed at safeguarding human rights. 
We strongly oppose all forms of child 
and forced labour and uphold principles 
of non-discrimination in the workplace. 
Additionally, we ensure that all of our 
workforce receives minimum wages and 
can exercise other fundamental rights. 
Our Human Resources department is 
responsible for managing any matters 
related to violations of human rights 
and diligently addressing and resolving 
any issues raised by employees.
Negative

Responsible 
Supply Chain
Risk and 
Opportunity
With 
increasing 
customer, 
investor, 
and 
regulatory 
demands, 
there 
is 
a 
growing need to integrate 
sustainability principles across 
the entire value chain to foster 
a more streamlined working 
environment. This approach 
aims to minimise ESG risks and 
promote responsible growth. 
A responsible supply chain 
can help mitigate operational 
risks associated with non-
compliance 
with 
statutory 
requirements and also reduce 
our carbon footprint.
DEN sees the integration of ESG risk 
considerations into the supply chain as 
an opportunity for overall risk reduction 
and mitigation. The Company plans 
to undertake assessments covering 
environmental, social, and governance 
parameters of the supply chain.
Negative and 
Positive

Data Privacy and 
Security
Risk
As a digital-first business, 
protecting data privacy and 
strengthening 
cybersecurity 
is crucial to protect our 
operations, 
customers, 
infrastructure, and internal 
users from security risks.
DEN has implemented a slew of 
measures to enhance the resilience 
of our systems and procedures to 
prevent data breaches or cyber security 
issues. We have DEN has implemented 
a risk management protocol that 
involves identifying potential threats, 
creating plans to mitigate these risks, 
and monitoring the progress of the 
implementation of mitigation actions. 
Additionally, 
we 
conduct 
regular 
data privacy and security sessions 
for our employees to raise awareness 
about data breach prevention and 
cybersecurity.

Governance and 
Accountability
Risk
The 
efficiency 
of 
the 
Company 
is 
directly 
influenced 
by 
governance 
and 
accountability. 
Any 
shortcomings 
in 
the 
governance 
structure 
or 
practices can undermine the 
trust and confidence that 
stakeholders 
have 
in 
the 
Company.
DEN 
has 
a

governance 
structure in place, with clear roles and 
responsibilities assigned to leadership

issues by leveraging insights from external stakeholders. These insights will inform the formulation of our sustainability strategy for

internal mechanisms, employees also have the option to approach the Chairman of the Audit Committee to address any grievances 
related to human rights violations or any other violations within the Company. This provides an additional avenue for employees to 
seek a resolution and ensures that there is a higher level of accountability for addressing such issues.

promptly and effectively, with a thorough investigative process ensuring fairness and impartiality. All parties involved are provided 
with the opportunity to present relevant evidence and facts, ensuring transparency and due process. DEN also maintains an active HR 
department for a quick redressal of any Human Rights violations. We strive to continually improve human rights protection by setting 
targets, adopting industry best practices and reviewing our performance regularly.
