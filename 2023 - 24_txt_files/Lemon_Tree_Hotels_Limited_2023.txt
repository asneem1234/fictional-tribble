reducing emissions of pollutants such as CO2 and SO2 
•	 Retrofit Emission Control Devices (RECD) have been 
installed at three properties to reduce emissions from 
existing DG sets, helping us meet stricter pollution 
control norms
•	 39 EV charging stations were installed in 3 cities i.e. 
Mumbai, Pune, Gurugram
•	 CII/IGBC Green Building certification for 12 hotels (upto 
31st March 2024). Our target is to certify all 41 owned/
leased hotels by FY26 
•	 PNG supply in kitchens (switchover from LPG) to align 
with a cleaner fuel option
•	 Installation of heat pumps that allows for energy efficient 
heating and cooling

Accessibility of workplaces
 
Are the premises/offices of the entity accessible to differently abled employees and workers, as 
per the requirements of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016? If not, whether any 
steps are being taken by the entity in this regard.
We take pride in designing all our hotels with universal access in mind. Our goal is to create barrier-
free environments that cater to guests of all abilities, mobility levels and ages. By providing accessible 
public bathrooms and restaurants, we ensure that guests with disabilities feel welcome and included in our 
local community.
For our specially-abled guests, we offer well-designed rooms equipped with various features for their 
comfort and convenience. Starting from the entrance ramp that provides easy access to the lobby, our 
hotels are designed to be hassle-free for physically challenged guests. The lobby area seamlessly connects 
to elevators, specially designed public toilets and the coffee shop.
Our specially-abled rooms are thoughtfully equipped with features such as user-friendly elevators, close 
proximity to elevators (often on the first floor), wider main doors (1,000 mm) for wheelchair passage, a lower 
“‘magic eye”” on the main door, lower luggage rack/table (below 450 mm), writing table at least 750 mm in 
height, bed height at 500 mm, no mini bar adjacent to the bed, key card fixture at a lower height, cordless 
phone, lower-fixed mirrors, audio-visual fire alarms, and direct emergency call bells at the Front Desk.
In the bathrooms, we ensure wash basins with adjustable heights, WC at 475 mm, shower seats at 475 mm 
width, knob-type shower mixer handles, hand showers without buckets or spouts, and stainless steel support 
railings for ease of movement. Additionally, we provide convex mirrors at lower levels and handicapped 
toilets in public areas with similar facilities.”

Does the entity have an equal opportunity policy as per the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 
Act, 2016? If so, provide a web-link to the policy.

Further Details:
We are deeply committed to promoting diversity and gender equality within our organisation, recognising the 
value it brings in tapping into often overlooked talent pools. As an equal-opportunity employer, we prioritise 
building a diverse, safe, and inclusive work environment. Embracing individual differences and empowering 
every employee to reach their full potential is central to fostering innovation, employee satisfaction, and 
unique ideas.
Our efforts towards inclusivity are focused on creating a workplace where everyone, regardless of their 
background, can work collaboratively towards shared goals. We understand that equitable employment 
generation is essential for driving sustainable socio-economic development in our nation. To promote 
diversity and inclusion, we actively hire Opportunity Deprived Individuals (ODIs), encompassing Employees 
with Disability (EwD) and those from Economically and Socially Marginalised backgrounds (EcoSoc).
	
Employees with Disability (EwD)
We began our journey of hiring employees with special needs in 2007. Over the years, we have been strongly 
committed towards hiring individuals with special needs and creating an accessible and growth-oriented 
work environment for them. This includes individuals with:
1.	
Physical disabilities: Speech and Hearing Impaired (SHI), Orthopedically Handicapped (OH), Acid 
Survivors, Low Vision
2.	
Intellectual and Developmental Disability (IDD): Down Syndrome, Slow Learner, Mild MR, IDD and Autism
Across all our hotels, we have a significant presence of SHIs, followed by OH. Through our strategic 
partnerships with NGOs that focus on training of individuals with Intellectual and Developmental needs, we 
plan to continuously enhance and expand our traineeship model.
	
Economically and Socially Marginalised segment (EcoSoc)
We have focused on hiring people who belong to socially and economically weaker sections of society since 
2016. This includes individuals who fall below the poverty line, widowed or destitute women, orphans/
abandoned girls, transgender persons and those from select states that rank low on education and 
employment opportunities. By generating employment for these people, we effectively contribute towards 
poverty alleviation and social justice.

Prevention of Corrupt Practices and a comprehensive Code of Conduct. Upholding 
the utmost priority, we maintain anonymity for individuals raising complaints, 
ensuring their protection and confidentiality throughout the process.
We have an open door policy where employees can discuss issues with any unit 
or corporate function head. We also conduct regular "Engagement Chat" at hotels 
so that employees can share their feedback, issues and grievances and ideas for 
improvement with their General Managers.

*1 Note: Skill Upgradation - the %age is more than 100% because an employee undergoes multiple training programs for his/
her role (Room Boy, Public Area Attendant, Associate-F&B (Service), etc.). These can be at the basic level or at a higher and 
more complex (within the person’s function) or behavioral skill upgradation.
 
Note: All training data above is the sum of employees trained in different programmes and in different months. It includes 
duplication of people and is not a unique data set. Eg. If Rajat attends the induction, ESG, Front Office 101 and Security in the 
same year, he is counted four times.

Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity.
	
Engaging with our stakeholders is vital as it enables us to comprehend and align with their expectations, 
ultimately leading to better satisfaction. Their diverse needs serve as valuable inputs that shape our goals 
and strategic decisions. We have identified twelve (12) distinct stakeholder groups, and we maintain clear 
commitments to each of them, ensuring we address their specific requirements effectively.
Stakeholder 
Category
Why we need to engage
How we engage
Employees
Our employees create guest experiences and 
ensure that their expectations are met and even 
exceeded. We rely on the service delivery of our 
employees to enhance our brand image through 
exceptional service.
We regularly engage with our employees through 
internal town halls and other mechanisms. 
Frequent team-building exercises foster harmony 
and bring synergy to our team. We also rely on 
forums including new employee “fresh-eyes” 
discussions and weekly engagement chats 
between hotel managers and employees on a 
one-on-one basis to assess their needs.
Customers
Our customers are key stakeholders who 
experience our service delivery. Our revenues are 
directly linked with the trust and relationships that 
we nurture with our customers. Their feedback 
is critical to our financial success. Our brand 
standards too evolve based on this ongoing 
feedback.
We invite direct feedback from our customers 
prior to departure from our hotels. We also track 
their comments on our services after they have 
left our premises i.e. through Online Relationship 
Management (ORM) platforms. We monitor our 
social media engagement to understand the 
live feedback of our customers. We update our 
customers about hotel launches, new services, 
and/or periodic offers, through our loyalty 
program (Lemon Tree Smiles) via emailers, 
newsletters, etc.

Stakeholder 
Category
Why we need to engage
How we engage
Regulatory 
Bodies and 
Government
Ongoing engagement with regulatory bodies and 
the federal/state/local governments. We seek their 
support in complying with applicable laws and 
regulations.
They issue operating licenses and permits, which 
are critical for us to conduct our business. 
Investors and 
Shareholders
Our investors and shareholders are interested in 
the success and sustainability of our business. They 
have provided the foundation, by providing capital, 
for our business to grow. The motivation to meet/
exceed the expectations of our investors inspires us 
to continuously improve and, in that process, also 
deliver better value to other stakeholders.
Our quarterly presentations and annual meetings 
serve as an opportunity to engage with investors 
and shareholders regarding our performance and 
get their feedback. We also invite their feedback 
on our annual disclosures.
Owners and 
Partners
Owners/partners who own managed hotels (run 
by Lemon Tree Hotels) are also responsible for 
maintaining our brand standards. This asset-light 
growth model is critical to our business success as 
it ensures quick geographic spread and penetration, 
and offers our customers a wide choice across the 
country.
Our business development team and marketing 
team engages with owners and partners to ensure 
they have the necessary tools and support to 
uphold and enhance our brand’s reputation. We 
also have regular discussions through bilateral 
meetings with owners and partners.
Suppliers and 
Vendors
Engaging regularly with our suppliers and vendors 
is critical for our business, to ensure that the 
products and services they deliver to us meet our 
brand standards.
We engage with them frequently through informal 
interactions and periodical reviews. We discuss 
product quality, product specifications, timely 
supply, pricing and payment terms along with 
ethical and responsible sourcing.
Contractors
We are also supported by an outsourced workforce 
in providing quality services to our customers. 
This makes it critical for us to engage with our 
contractors who ensure the availability of trained 
staff who can deliver on our standards.
We engage with them frequently through informal 
interactions, meetings and periodical reviews to 
discuss matters pertaining to the well-being and 
engagement levels of our outsourced workforce.
Online Travel 
Agencies/
Portals
Online Travel Agencies support us in customer 
acquisition along with providing us insights into 
customer behavior and decision-making criteria. 
Reviewing customer feedback on their platforms is 
an important aspect of our business. 
We maintain an open dialogue and conduct 
frequent meetings to stay connected with them.
NGOs
NGOs help us deliver on our commitment to being 
an equal opportunity employer by supporting us in 
selecting and training candidates with disability and 
candidates from economically/socially marginalised 
backgrounds (together called Opportunity Deprived 
Individuals (ODIs)). Moving forward, they will 
play a pivotal role in supporting the design and 
implementation of our CSR initiatives.
Our annual reports help our NGO partners assess 
our priorities and we engage with them regarding 
further opportunities for collaboration through 
regular meetings and specific engagement events. 
Local 
Communities
We engage with local communities to understand 
their needs which helps us deliver greater impact 
through curated social welfare programs.
We engage with them through our NGO partners 
and/or local hotel teams.
Industry 
Associations
Industry associations serve as a platform for us to 
understand business trends and opportunities and 
collaborate with our peers in the travel and tourism 
industry.
We engage in multilateral meetings and events 
through industry associations and utilise these 
platforms to communicate our initiatives and learn 
about the initiatives of others.
Media
We leverage our relationship with media for brand 
building, engagement with local communities on 
different initiatives as well as release press notes 
on hotel launches, special promotions and offers.
We engage with media agencies and personnel 
regularly through press releases, press notes and 
briefings. The intent is to publicise our new hotel 
openings and initiatives. We curate news briefs 
exclusively for our media partners to keep them 
apprised of relevant updates about our operations.

Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, 
environmental, and social topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such 
consultations provided to the Board.
We have set up various committees on economic and ESG governance and performance monitoring. 
These committees are Nomination and Remuneration Committee, Share Allotment Committee, Audit 
Committee, Stakeholders Relationship Committee, Corporate Social Responsibility Committee and Risk 
Management Committee.
The Nomination and Remuneration Committee, Finance Committee, Share Allotment Committee, Audit 
Committee, Stakeholders Relationship Committee, Sustainability Committee, Corporate Social Responsibility 
Committee, General Management Committee and Risk Management Committee are constituted by the Board 
and are respectively chaired by an Independent Director. As per their respective terms of reference, the various 
Committees (statutory as well as internal) meet periodically to review the performance of the Company across 
various areas. A quarterly performance update and review is conducted by each committee (on the respecitve 
area) and consolidated reports/follow throughs are presented to the Board in the quarterly meeting. Also, the 
Company conducts the stakeholder engagement exercise on ESG topics, from time to time.

Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of 
environmental, and social topics (Yes/No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the 
inputs received from stakeholders on these topics were incorporated into policies and activities 
of the entity.
Yes
The outcomes of the materiality assessment/stakeholder engagement exercise help the company identify 
material topics in the area of sustainability/ESG. Based on key material topics, the company’s policy 
setting and strategic approach are developed and implemented. Where required, goals are defined along 
with monitoring mechanisms and responsibility (for results) is assigned to members of the leadership 
team. As illustrations:
•	 Energy management: We endeavour to monitor and reduce our energy consumption on an ongoing 
basis. We have implemented several initiatives including the use of renewable energy (RE) as well as 
adopting energy efficient systems across operations
•	 Water Management: We acknowledge the need to ensure the most efficient use of water. We have 
implemented several initiatives to reduce our overall water consumption as well as adopt systems to 
effectively manage our water footprint
•	 Customer Satisfaction: Our customer-centric approach enables us to provide curated and customised 
experiences to our guests and cater to their requirements. We regularly conduct satisfaction surveys to 
obtain feedback on our services
•	 Ethics and Transparency: We ensure that we conduct our business in an ethical and transparent manner. 
This includes following a code of conduct as well as ensuring that we are guided by our Anti-Bribery and 
Anti-Corruption Policy, Whistleblower Policy and Vigil Mechanism

their knowledge of the language is tested as well
•	 Training for Employees With Disability (EWD) is conducted in a manner 
that is suitable for that disability i.e. deaf colleagues are trained in an 
integrated session where there is a 'speaking' trainer and an ISL interpreter 
who translates alongside; low vision colleagues are given content that 
is inclusive and accessible; employees with intellectual/developmental 
disability or autism are not taught in a classroom and are trained through 
a 6 month+ internship

abroad (in-person in the UK (Glasgow), Singapore, and Switzerland and 
virtual in the UK, Japan, Europe, Israel, and more)
•	 We are an active employer of PWD and act as a strategic partner to NGOs 
working in the disability space. This is done across its 100+ hotels in India 
located in 60+ destinations. The inclusion initiative was started in 2007 and 
has continued through these 17 years (despite the pandemic) making it a 
highly sustainable endeavour.

served 2 terms over 5 years. SCPWD is a part of the National Skill 
Development Council (NSDC) and focussed on making training inclusive 
and implementable for PWD with different types of disability including Deaf, 
Visually Impaired, Orthopaedically Handicapped, Down Syndrome, Autism,

With respect to the ecologically sensitive areas Data Needed at Question 10 of Essential 
Indicators above, provide details of significant direct & indirect impact of the entity on 
biodiversity in such areas along-with prevention and remediation activities.
	
Lemon Tree’s property in Bandhavgarh is located near a forest and the properties in Cochin, Muhamma/
Alleppey and Candolim, Goa are located in coastal regulation zones.
	
We recognise the impact of the development and operations of our hotels and accept our responsibility 
towards the surrounding environment, natural resources and biodiversity of the locations where we have our 
32
Lemon Tree Hotels Limited - Integrated Report FY24
properties. We try to ensure that none of our operations lie within the boundaries of designated protected 
areas, such as national parks and wildlife reserves. Further, we shall strive to integrate our commitment 
to conserving biodiversity and habitat into our development/acquisitions and operations strategy.
	
For example, at Bandhavgarh, some of the measures taken by us to minimise our environmental 
footprint include:
	
•	
Waste Management: We have discontinued the use of packaged drinking water, plastic cutlery, 
miniature toiletries, and single-use plastic. We have also selected a local partner to process and 
manage our kitchen waste and the compost generated through this is used in and around the reserve.
	
•	
Water Management: The water we use at the resort is treated at the Sewage Treatment Plant and 
reused to maintain the gardens at our hotel while ensuring no harmful water discharge in and around 
the resort.
	
•	
Supporting Local Flora and Fauna: We recognise our role in supporting the local forest division in 
managing forest fires near the resort. Furthermore, we have also planted over 100 trees within our 
premises to maintain the greenery of the surrounding areas.
	
These initiatives have helped us in ensuring that our operations are not in conflict with nature.

RECD
(Retro Emission 
Control Device)
The primary purpose of RECDs is to enhance air quality 
by controlling the emission of hydrocarbons and carbon 
monoxide from diesel generators. RECDs are installed on 
generators and can control and reduce harmful emissions. 
The device, essentially a stainless steel box, is mounted on 
the generator’s exhaust system. It operates on filter-less 
technology and captures and reduces specific particles from 
emissions. It captures carbon matter with an efficiency of 
more than 90%, significantly reducing the environmental 
impact of these generators.
12
DF Kit
(Dual Fuel Kit)
Dual Fuel kits are designed to enhance the efficiency and 
versatility of diesel generators. They allow a diesel generator 
to run on a combination of two fuels, typically diesel and a 
gaseous fuel like natural gas or propane. They serve two 
purposed (1) reduce operating costs (gaseous fuels cost less 
than diesel). (2) reduces the environmental impact/emits 
fewer pollutants.
13
Bio gas Plant
Biogas plants simultaneously take care of waste management 
and act as a source of energy. It uses anaerobic digestion, a 
process where organic waste is broken down by bacteria in 
the absence of oxygen, thereby producing biogas. Benefits 
include: renewable energy source (zero emissions), reduce 
waste disposal costs, contribution to the circular economy.
14
Bottling Plant
Lemon Tree installs water bottling plant (for drinking water) 
to remove single-use plastic packaged water and reduce 
our plastic footprint. We also see a benefit of 10-11% 
reduction in expenditure on packaged water. The plant’s 
SOPs incorporate all required cleaning, sanitizing, filling and 
packaging (date stickers used).
At Aurika Skycity (Mumbai), we have used a new technology 
called CDI (Capacitive De-Ionization) which saves energy and 
water both.
The CDI based water purification process has a high water 
recovery of up to 90%, as well as a TDS reduction of up 
to 90% and low electricity consumption of only 30% as 
compared to the current Reverse Osmosis (RO) technology.
