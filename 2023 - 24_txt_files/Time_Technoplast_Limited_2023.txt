Occupaonal Health 
and Safety
Risk and Opportunity
U n h e a l t h y,  u n s a f e  a n d 
hazardous work condions can 
cause physical and mental 
health issues for workers which 
will lead to reduced producvity. 
Any gaps in meeng Health & 
Safety regulatory standards can 
lead to penal acons.
The manufacturing operaons 
of the Company require 
employees to interact with 
plant, machinery, and material 
handling equipment, all of which 
carry an inherent risk of injury.
CommiEed to providing robust 
Health & Safety management 
system by:
 Providing safe and healthy 
working condions for the 
prevenon of work­related 
injury and ill health.
 M e e  n g  r e g u l a t o r y 
standards/requirements and 
taking steps for connued 
improvement.
 Conducng periodic audits to 
idenfy HS risks and taking 
proacve steps to minimise 
and migate the same.
Posi've:
Robust Occupaonal Health 
and Safety standards minimise 
or prevent the occurrence of 
untoward incidents and bring 
higher producvity. It also 
contributes to elevate brand 
image of the Company amongst 
regulators and investors.
Nega've:
Poor Occupaonal Health and 
Safety will result in frequent 
untoward incidents and lower 
e m p l o y e e  m o r a l e  a n d 
producvity.

Climate
Risk
Climate­related risks consist of 
both physical risks resulng 
from the direct impacts of 
climate change (such as extreme 
weather events) and transion 
risks related to eﬀorts to 
transion to a lower­carbon 
economy (such as carbon 
pricing, future government 
policy and regulaon). 
As the global economy shiUs 
towards a low­carbon future, 
plasc product manufacturers 
may face risks associated with 
the transion. This includes 
technological advancements, 
c h a n g i n g  c o n s u m e r 
preferences, and evolving 
regulaons.
T h e s e  r i s ks  ca n  l e a d  to 
signiﬁcant business impacts, if 
not managed adequately well in 
me.
We have planned a clear 
pathway to manage climate 
change risk by focusing on 
reducing our environment 
footprints through Greenhouse 
Gas (GHG) emissions reducon, 
e n e r g y  e ﬃc i e n c y,  a n d 
renewable energy.
Monitoring and reporng on 
climate performance, including 
seang targets and tracking 
progress towards emissions 
reducons and other climate­
related goals.
Staying informed about evolving 
climate related regulaons and 
policies to ensure compliance 
and migate regulatory risk.
Nega've:
Failure to address climate­
related issues or implement 
sustainable pracces can lead 
to reputaonal damage and 
loss of customer trust.
Changes in investor preferences 
and the availability of funding 
may impact access to capital or 
increase the cost of borrowing.

Risk Management
Risk and Opportunity
Deﬁciency of robust controls 
a n d  l a c k  o f  p ro p e r  r i s k 
management & migaon 
system may lead to adverse 
impact on business operaons 
and growth plans.
Proper risk management 
processes enable the Company 
to address the risks in a mely 
and eﬃcient manner and 
thereby thwart any interrupon 
or disrupon of business. It also 
bolsters the Company’s business 
connuity plan.
Managing risk is an interacve 
process and assists us in seang 
strategy, achieving objecves 
and making informed decisions. 
The Company has a well­
established risk management 
s y s t e m  w h i c h  i n c l u d e s 
idenﬁcaon of various risks, 
analysis and assessment of risks 
idenﬁed, formulaon of risk 
management and migaon 
strategies and implementaon 
of the same to ensure business 
connuity, if risk materialises. 
Major risks idenﬁed are 
regulatory, compeon, ESG, 
supply chain disrupon, cyber & 
data security, economic and 
polical etc.
Posi've:
A robust Risk Management and 
Migaon Plan enable the 
Company to take mely 
acons/measures to minimise 
t h e  c h a n c e  o f  r i s k 
materialisaon and its adverse 
impact, if the risk indeed 
materialises.

Key to consistency is customer 
retenon, sustained business

By priorizing customer

Posi've:

reducing customer churn, and 
increasing repeat sales.
Sasﬁed customers are more 
likely to make repeat purchases

Sustainable 
packaging
Opportunity
Switching to renewable and 
increasing reused packing 
materials reduces dependence 
on virgin materials thereby, 
reducing consumpon of non­
renewable raw materials
Transion towards renewable 
materials reduces the waste 
going to landﬁll.
Increasing usage of reused 
materials has reduced the 
dependency on virgin materials.
This has an ability to implement 
a circular economy within the 
Company
Posi've:
Switching to sustainable 
packaging has enhanced 
circular economy and helped 
reduce overall carbon footprint 
of the Company

Brieﬂy describe the waste management prac'ces adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your Company to 
reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the prac'ces adopted to manage such wastes.
 
Recycling plasc waste within our manufacturing units is a signiﬁcant step towards sustainable waste management. By ulizing grinders and 
shredders, we are able to process and reuse plasc waste, reducing the need for new plasc producon and minimizing the environmental 
impact associated with plasc disposal.
 
In addion to plasc waste, we also priorize the proper disposal of other types of waste such as e­waste, baEery waste, spent oil, and scraps. 
These materials oUen contain hazardous components that require specialized handling and treatment to prevent harm to the environment 
and human health. By engaging authorized vendors, we ensure that these waste materials are managed in compliance with relevant 
regulaons and best pracces.

undergo recurrent training on the Emergency Plan. The plan is subject to regular tesng and review, including frequent emergency mock drills, 
to guarantee readiness.
 
The Company has also ensured that each plant can also produce products from other locaons in case of any producon delay, disrupon, or 
local disaster.
 
Moreover, the Company has established a robust risk management framework to idenfy and evaluate business risks and opportunies
