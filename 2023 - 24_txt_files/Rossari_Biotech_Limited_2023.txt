Yes, The Company has been constantly researching and developing new chemicals and processes that have lower environmental 
impacts throughout their lifecycle, from production to disposal. The Company has been improving its operational efficiencies for 
reducing the consumption of resources without compromising on the quality and quantity of its range of Specialty Chemicals. Waste 
generated during the production operations, is disposed/recycled in compliance with the applicable environmental laws.

With a view to reduce carbon footprint, the Company has implemented more efficient machinery at plants to reduce the power 
consumption and to reduce raw materials that are high contributors to produce carbon footprint. We have adopted several green 
initiatives to reduce carbon footprint and have implemented the best environmental practices for green manufacturing.
	
Major energy conservation projects are listed below:
	
(a)	
Upgraded the drive system for the - Effluent Treatment Plant (“ETP”) final discharge process, resulting in annual energy savings 
of 48,000 units. This not only reduces our energy consumption but also reinforces our commitment to sustainable operations 
and environmental responsibility.
	
(b)	
Re-engineered the electrical logic to enable automatic on-off switching for motors, coolant pumps, blowers, and other equipment, 
we optimised the cooling plant’s operation, enhancing overall energy efficiency.
	
(c)	
Installed 600 kVA solar panels at our Dahej facility, which has been instrumental in transition to renewable energy sources, 
reducing reliance on conventional power, lowering carbon footprint, and promoting sustainability.
	
(d)	
Implemented air pollution control measures, including a lamella clarifier, a dust collector, and an alkali scrubber.
	
(e)	
Installed and refined maintenance practices for steam lines, minimising energy losses due to condensation and leaks. These 
improvements lead to reduced energy consumption and lower operational costs.
	
(f)	
Implemented motion sensors in unmanned areas such as the canteen and corridors to reduce energy waste.
	
Further, the Company is in the process of outsourcing steam used in its production process from outside which is a waste for another 
Company, this in turn reduces the overall carbon footprint associated with steam production compared to traditional methods that 
rely solely on primary energy sources and promotes collaboration towards a more sustainable industrial ecosystem.

Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report
10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your Company to 
reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes:
	
Waste generation is an inevitable part of manufacturing process, thus the Company takes efforts to create value from waste. With 
an aim to divert a significant quantum of waste from going to landfills, systems and procedures the Company integrates a waste 
management plan with a comprehensive approach towards waste minimisation, segregation and safe disposal.
	
Measures for waste minimisation are undertaken by the Company in both its plants. Waste generated during the production operations, 
is disposed/recycled in compliance with the applicable environmental laws. The effluent generated is treated in compliance with the 
applicable environmental laws and is recycled back into the production processes or discharged in common landfill or incineration.
	
Some of the waste management practices adopted by the Company are as follows:
	
(a)	
The Company uses primarily non-hazardous and non-toxic raw materials and is a Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals 
(“ZDHC”) certified organisation.
	
(b)	
Instead of incineration, the Company disposes of hazardous waste through pre-processing or co-processing methods this ensures 
that 100% of hazardous and toxic waste is treated and discarded responsibly.
	
(c)	
Integrate principles of green chemistry into product design to minimise the use of hazardous chemicals from the outset.
	
(d)	
The Company understands its responsibility towards environment and so makes a constant effort to use majority of packaging 
materials that are sustainable and can be reused /recycled on a regular basis.
	
(e)	
The Company has increased sewage water recycling by using Sewage Treatment Plant (“STP”) for treatment of sewage 
water. The treated water is utilised for floor washing, washroom flushing & gardening. This initiative of recycling water offers a 
sustainable solution to water management challenges, promoting efficient use of resources, protecting the environment, and 
enhancing resilience to climate change and water scarcity.
	
The Company’s aim is to minimise the amount of waste sent to landfills and to promote sustainable handling and treatment of waste 
streams to make Dahej Facility ‘Zero Liquid Discharge’ (“ZLD”) facility as currently only Silvassa facility is 100% ZLD.
