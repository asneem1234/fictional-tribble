DIRECTORS MESSAGE:
Dear Stakeholders,
We are delighted to share with you our Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report for the financial year 2023-24. This 
report underscores our unwavering commitment to Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) principles and details the 
strides we have made in these critical areas.
We are acutely aware of the pressing environmental issues such as climate change, resource depletion and pollution. In 
response, we have set clear targets to cut down our carbon emissions, reduce waste and advance sustainable resource 
management. Our operations are guided by a meticulous Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for handling expired or 
defective products, ensuring they are disposed of or incinerated at government-approved facilities.
At Gufic, we actively engage in initiatives for water conservation, energy management, waste reduction and greenhouse gas 
emission control. By leveraging technological advancements and manufacturing excellence, we are committed to enhancing 
access to and affordability of safe, effective and high-quality medicines. Our goal is to meet the needs of our patients and 
customers.
Our governance framework is designed to uphold transparency, adhere to legal and regulatory standards and ensure 
accountability. We maintain a robust system for addressing grievances and safeguarding whistleblowers, reinforcing our 
commitment to ethical practices and high standards of corporate governance.
We recognize the profound connection between social well-being and our business activities. We are dedicated to making a 
meaningful impact through our efforts to enhance employee welfare, foster community engagement and champion diversity 
and inclusion. Our CSR initiatives this year covered a broad spectrum, including healthcare, education, rural development and 
animal welfare, reflecting our commitment to social good.
We continuously evaluate our performance and set ambitious goals to further minimize environmental impact, advance social 
well-being and strengthen our governance practices. Engaging with our stakeholders and collaborating with industry peers will 
remain key as we tackle emerging challenges and drive positive change.

Leadership Indicators 
1.  Provide the processes  for  consultation  between  stakeholders  and  the  Board  on economic,  environmental
 
and  social  topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the
 
Board.
 
The stakeholder engagement mechanism is essential for enhancing and diversifying stakeholder relationships. It helps to
 
identify critical issues that significantly impact the Company's growth. Stakeholders can express concerns about economic,
 
environmental, and social issues through our dedicated grievance redressal email. Upon receiving an email, we
 
acknowledge its receipt promptly and provide an initial response to address immediate concerns. If specific queries need
 
further attention from the Board or Management, the Company Secretary escalates them accordingly. The Board or
 
Management then carefully reviews these matters and makes informed decisions, notifying the concerned individual of the
 
outcome via email.
 
Additionally, to ensure stakeholder satisfaction, the Board or Management reviews all complaints and oversees their
 
resolution. This process ensures that appropriate actions are taken to address and resolve any issues. Our grievance
 
redressal system is designed to promote transparency, accountability, and effective stakeholder engagement, ensuring that
 
all concerns are addressed promptly and maintaining a positive, mutually beneficial relationship with our stakeholders.

these topics were incorporated into policies and activities of the entity.
 
Yes, the Company is committed to fostering inclusive and collaborative growth by prioritizing regular, constructive
 
interactions  with stakeholders to address key issues related to social impact, the environment, and human rights. Through
 
employee  engagement activities, vendor meetings, and ongoing communication with local communities, the Company
 
seeks to  understand and address environmental and social concerns. By consulting with key stakeholders, the Company
 
identifies  and prioritizes material topics based on their business impact. This feedback-driven approach enhances
 
communication and  collaboration forums, improves health and safety, and supports the well-being of employees.
 
Additionally, it streamlines business processes for suppliers and effectively addresses environmental and social aspects.
 
Through these initiatives, the  Company aims to drive sustainable development and ensure that its operations positively
 
impact both stakeholders and the  broader society.

norms. The wastewater is treated in a facility consisting of primary, secondary and tertiary treatment with membrane
 
filtration [Ultrafiltration (UF)/ Reverse Osmosis (RO)]. Treated process waste water and condensate produced by this
 
system is effectively utilized in boilers and other utilities. At our Indore plant, we have implemented a treatment system
 
comprising ETP, UF, and RO. The permeate water from the RO process is utilized for gardening, green belt development
 
and cooling towers. There is no effluent generation at our Belgaum site. Moreover, the Company promotes water
 
conservation through a reduce, reuse, and recycle strategy across its manufacturing sites.
