Business Responsibility & Sustainability Reporting
Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) is the practice of companies 
disclosing information about their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance. 
It goes beyond financial reporting to provide stakeholders with a comprehensive view of a 
company's non-financial impacts and contributions to sustainable development. BRSR covers 
topics such as environmental impact, social responsibility, and governance practices, aiming to 
promote transparency and accountability.

 1.
Occupational Health 
and Safety
Risk
The nature of the company’s 
operations gives rise to various 
health 
hazards, 
particularly 
impacting 
on-site 
employees 
and workers. These individuals 
are exposed to potential physical 
injuries due to the dynamic 
and challenging nature of their 
work. They are also exposed to 
risks associated with handling 
hazardous materials intrinsic to 
construction and manufacturing 
processes.
The company’s strict adherence 
to 
safety 
norms, 
initiatives 
safeguarding 
the 
health 
and 
safety of workforce and its 
Zero 
Tolerance 
Policy 
help 
protect individuals and ensure 
compliance with applicable laws 
and regulations. Periodic training 
sessions for both employees and 
workers, along with regular site 
monitoring provides assurance to 
stakeholders
Negative
 2.
Climate change and 
Emissions
Risk
The company generates carbon 
emissions during construction, 
manufacturing, 
logistics 
and 
administrative 
activities. 
Emissions from construction and 
manufacturing processes release 
pollutants and greenhouse gases, 
adversely 
impacting 
air 
and 
water quality. Additional climate 
change is posing an increasing 
transitional risk such as increased 
compliance, 
potential 
carbon 
taxes and physical risk such as 
disruption on construction site 
due to flash floods and water 
scarcity due to uneven rainfalls
Adopting sustainable practices 
and reducing emissions enhances 
the organization’s reputation and 
demonstrates a commitment to 
positive environmental impact. 
Ongoing initiatives, such as Green 
Construction 
practices, 
solar 
power utilization and the use 
of electric vehicles, underscore 
the company’s commitment to 
reducing carbon emissions.

damage.
To mitigate the risk of not adhering 
to 
construction 
quality 
and 
safety standards, The Company 
enforce stringent quality control 
measures, 
implement 
robust 
safety 
protocols, 
and 
invest

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets, and achievements (listed 
entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
Dear Stakeholders,
I am pleased to share our BRSR report for FY 2023-24. As we continue to advance our commitment to sustainability and responsible business 
practices, GRIL has achieved several significant milestones and made substantial progress in integrating Environmental, Social, and Governance 
(ESG) principles into our operations. 
In FY 2023-24, we took a significant step toward robust ESG governance by establishing an ESG Committee at the Board level. We further 
solidified our commitment by forming an ESG Working Group and introducing an extensive ESG Charter, which outlines the responsibilities of the 
ESG Committee and the ESG Working Group. Serving as our guiding framework, the Charter ensures that our commitment to sustainable and 
ethical practices is upheld throughout all levels and areas of our business, highlighting our dedication to deeply integrating ESG principles across 
our operations.
Guided by the ESG Committee, the ESG Working Group has conducted a comprehensive Materiality Assessment in accordance with Global 
Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards, engaging both internal and external stakeholders. This evaluation has been essential in helping us identify 
and rank the ESG issues that are most important to our stakeholders and business. It has also given us important insights into our goals and 
objectives and helped to shape our strategic direction. In addition to creating a plan for reaching Net-Zero emissions and providing alignment with 
stakeholder interests while advancing our sustainability commitments, the group is now finalizing ESG goals and targets.
In FY 2023-24, we have taken significant steps in minimizing our environmental footprint by:
 
 
Creating sewage treatment facilities, building sedimentation tanks to properly manage runoff water, preventing soil erosion and 
contamination, assuring responsible waste management, and reducing our environmental impact. 
 
 
In addition to promoting the ideas of the circular economy, using RAP material in flexible pavement construction lowers the consumption 
of raw materials. 
 
 
We resale old batteries, tyres and used lubricants to OEMs and registered vendors who comply with safety regulations. In addition to 
ensuring safe disposal, this method aids in resource recovery.
 
 
Improved air quality and reduced particulate matter emissions are the outcome of the installation, upkeep, and frequent monitoring of filters 
in our cement silos and hot mix plants (HMP). 
 
 
The energy efficiency, power waste, and pollution reduction that have resulted from moving our lighting from fuel to grid energy and adding 
capacitor banks for grid supply. In addition to lowering dependency on non-renewable resources, the construction of solar plants shows 
our dedication to green energy.
 
 
In piling operations, the environmental impact has been reduced without compromising quality by using polymer instead of bentonite.
Recognising the importance of sustainability throughout the entire value chain, we have extended our efforts to our supply chain partners by 
introducing a robust Supplier Code of Conduct. This code’s implementation is planned in stages to include all our suppliers, ensuring that our 
entire supply chain aligns with our ESG commitments. The updated supplier declaration now includes certain ESG criteria, demonstrating our 
commitment to incorporating sustainability into all facets of our business. 
Our efforts to mitigate climate impact have also taken a significant step forward. We have recorded and reported on Scope 3 Greenhouse Gas 
emissions categories, which includes Purchased Goods and Services, Capital Goods, Waste Generated in Operations, Business Travel, Energy 
consumption and Employee Commute. By understanding and managing these emissions, we are better equipped to reduce our environmental 
footprint and contribute to global sustainability goals. Also, we reduced our energy intensity significantly this year, demonstrating our dedication 
to improving energy efficiency and incorporating sustainable practices into all aspects of our business operations.
In our commitment to support local economies and promote inclusive growth, we are proud to report that more than 20% of our procurement has 
been done through Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) and small producers. This initiative not only supports small businesses but 
also strengthens our supply chain resilience.
Our workforce constitutes the core of our operations, and their well-being remains a top priority for us. We are pleased to report a positive trend in 
the coverage and frequency of safety trainings conducted for our employees, which has correspondingly reduced workplace incidents.
To enhance transparency and accuracy in our reporting, we have digitised our ESG data collection process through a state-of-the-art technology 
tool. This advancement not only boosts data accuracy but also enhances operational efficiency, ensuring the correctness and reliability of the 
information we report.
As we move forward, I am confident that our unwavering commitment to ESG principles will drive our success and enable us to create lasting 
value for our stakeholders. I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to all our Internal and External stakeholders for their continued support and 
dedication. Together, we are shaping a sustainable and responsible future for G R Infraprojects.
Thank you.
Best regards,
Ajendra Kumar Agarwal
