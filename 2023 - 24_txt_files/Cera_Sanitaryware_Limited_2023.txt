combined capacity of
10.325 MW, generating
51,112 gigajoules. This
setup sufficiently meets
the majority of its energy
requirements,  
thus
reducing its dependency
on grid electricity.
Further, the Company has
also installed a waste heat
recovery system, which
reduces its dependency on
fossil fuels.
Our R&D unit explores
various alternatives aimed
at 
reducing 
fuel
consumption  including
using fuel-efficient burners
and incorporating newer
e n e r g y - s a v i n g

Water
Risk &
The Company recognises Positive &
management
Opportunity
the   importance   of  the
Negative
water and it has installed
state-of-the-art ETPs and
STPs in its manufacturing
facility to treatits influents.
Further, the company
reuses the treated water
in the production process,
gardening and other
applications. This has
enabled us to achieve Zero
Liquid Discharge (ZLD) in
our operations.
Additionally, we have
developed a fully functional
rainwater-harvesting
system by maintaining
over 10 wells within the
premises. This water is
further treated and reused
in production which
reduces the dependency
on ground water.
As a socially responsible
corporate citizen, Cera
prioritizes water-efficient
product design, with 49%
of its portfolio consisting of
water-saving products.
Risk
The manufacturing processes of
sanitaryware, faucetware, bathroom
accessories involve the consumption of
electricity and natural gas for operating
kilns which results in greenhouse gases
emissions (GHGs).
Opportunity
Adopting energy efficiency initiatives and
integrating renewables into the energy mix,
Cera can reduce operational costs and
strengthen its position as a responsible
brand.
Risk
Water is crucial in the mixing and moulding
stages of production. Improper water
management poses risks to operations,
increases costs, and could result in non-
compliance which affects the business
continuity.
Opportunity
Implementing water management practices
that optimize water usage is critical to
reduce the dependency on freshwater
sources. Additionally, incorporating water-
efficient 
product 
designs 
and
manufacturing fosters resilience and
encourages innovation within our business
model.

Opportunity
The majority of the waste generated in the

Company’s operations is recyclable.
Through ‘Waste Minimization and Waste
Utilization’ initiative, the company has
undertaken several measures to reduce,
reuse, and recycle its waste.
Repurposing waste at various production
stages (including bothunfired and fired

control measures reduces environmental
impact and provides a competitive edge in
the market.

commitment to social responsibility through
the implementation of strategic and trust-

interventions. The Company actively

Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its coverage and implementation.
Yes, Cera has implemented a Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) mechanism within our manufacturing facility. This comprehensive system ensures that all waste
water generated is treated and recycled or reused, with no discharge into the environment. We have achieved ZLD by implementing:
-
Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP): Initially treats the influent to remove contaminants.
-
Reverse Osmosis (RO): Further purifies the wastewater by removing dissolved salts and impurities.
-
Multiple Effect Evaporator (MEE): Concentrates or removes water from the effluent, leaving behind salts and solids.
We have implemented state-of-the-art technology, including two Effluent Treatment Plants (ETPs) with a combined capacity of 710 KLD and two Sewage
Treatment Plants (STPs) with a combined capacity of 140 KLD at our manufacturing facilities. These play a vital role in treating wastewater. A certain portion
of the treated water is reused in the production process for mould making, slip preparation, glaze preparation, casting, and chiller use, while the remaining
water is directed for gardening purposes. We ensure that there is no external water discharge from our manufacturing processes.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If yes, then provide details.
Cera has initiated Non-Conventional Energy generation project since 1995, harnessing wind and solar power to produce 10.325 MW of energy. Today, our
manufacturing plants in Gujarat fulfil over 74% of electricity requirements through non-conventional captive generation. Additionally, we prioritize cleaner
fuels like natural gas for our production processes. At our Kadi factory premises, we host a dedicated R&D unit recognized by the Department of Scientific
and Industrial Research (DSIR). This unit spearheads initiatives to minimize fuel consumption, driving efficiency improvements throughout our operations.
Energy audits were conducted at our locations, which helped identify energy-saving opportunities for energy conservation and cost reduction. The
recommendations from these audits are implemented based on priority. Some key initiatives implemented during this financial year include the installation of
Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs) for critical equipment such as furnace blowers and the replacement of traditional lights with LEDs. Additionally, we have
implemented automated controls and optimized equipment operation these timers ensure that equipment like ETP agitators and ball mills function only when
needed, further minimizing energy consumption. Moreover, frequent monitoring of energy consumption enables us to swiftly identify inefficiencies and
optimization opportunities. This approach aids in informed decision-making towards energy conservation and cost reduction.
