towards the

financial 
inclusion for 
people.
14  |  CHOICE INTERNATIONAL LIMITED
It gives me immense pleasure to present to you the Annual Report 
of our Company for theﬁnancial year 2023-24.
“Choice” follows the philosophy of our Founder Promoter “Shri 
Sunil Patodia Ji” of being a Game Changer and we tread the 
path he has hosted to us. 
Despite global headwinds, the Indian economy continued 
to demonstrate resilience. The runway for growth in India, 
predominantly driven by the country’s domestic consumption, 
remains immense. Global investors have acknowledged the 
country’s macroeconomic and ﬁnancial stability.
The year under review has been optimistic for “Choice” on many 
counts. Compounded growth in our market capitalisation over the 
years has been an ongoing manifestation of stakeholder trust on 
one hand, and our potential to create positive tangible impact on 
the ﬁnancial sector in the coming years.
We, at “Choice”, are conﬁdent of continuing our journey of growth 
and evolution driven by our ﬂexible business model and focus on 
innovation. I feel privileged to showcase our achievements during 
the year. Our Performance across business remained strong during 
the year with top line growth of 92% and PAT growth of 118% 
during FY24. Majority of our revenue worth 58% was contributed 
by Broking services followed by 30% from advisory services and 
11% from NBFC services. Our revenue has grown by a CAGR of 
62.85% over past 3 years. During the year, our EBITDA recorded 
a robust growth of over 110% to Rs. 2,277.70mn. This growth was 
largely driven by lower operatingexpenses and stafﬁng costs. 
PAT has grown at a CAGR of 98.58% over the past 3 years to Rs. 
1,308.59Mn. TheEPS has also been steadily increasing from 0.21 in 
FY19 to 6.57 in FY24.
This stellar Performance is an early sign of fructiﬁcation of our 
vision and efforts towards the mission of ﬁnancial inclusion for 
people who are yet to access the power of capital markets in the 
country by reaching and expanding our presence across tier 3 and 
tier 4 cities. We experienced an unprecedented increase in our 
active customers during the year supported by a 25% growth in 
our demat accounts to 8,48,000. wealth products also increased 
by 72% to INR 6,249 Mn during the year. We have expanded our 
loan book size by 104% YoY to INR 4.82 Bn from INR 2.36 Bn in 
FY24. Our Advisory business won multiple contracts worth over 
Rs. 1 Bn, further validating our expertise in executing and delivering 
projects over time.
“Choice” has consistently delivered superior results by largely 
creating addressable opportunities in underserved markets. We 
cherish the ideologies of our founder promoter “Shri Sunil Patodia 
Ji”. On behalf of our team, I wish to guarantee creating newer 
benchmarks as we progress into the foreseeable future.
Thanking you,

The year 
under review 
has been 
a year of 
evolution and 
acceleration 
of our growth. 
16  |  CHOICE INTERNATIONAL LIMITED
India is at the threshold of a “major structural shift” in its growth 
trajectory. The country  is moving towards a path where 8 per 
cent GDP growth could be sustained on a yearly basis for a longer 
term. On a calendar-year basis, India’s growth projections are 7.3 
per cent in 2024 and 6.5 per cent in 2025, according to the IMF. 
The report also states that Asia’s emerging market economies 
remained the main engine for the global economy. Growth in 
India and China is revised upwards and accounts for almost half 
of global growth. 
In 2024, the technological turbulence—including generative AI, 
transition to the cloud, increased fraud and cyber risk, and blurring 
of industry lines, such as the embedded ﬁnance trend—will require 
ﬁnancial services leaders to be much more agile than ever. New 
strategic options will need to be created to help ﬁrms tack in the 
direction of the prevailing breeze, wherever it’s coming from.
At “Choice” we accord tremendous importance to very high 
standards of corporate governance. This philosophy rests on the 
essential principles of independence, accountability, responsibility, 
transparency, fair and timely disclosures which have built credibility 
over the years. We are also hugely inspired by the philosophy of 
our Founder Shri Sunil Patodia ji. 
Our Broking & Distribution segment contributed to 58% of total 
revenue in 2023-24 with increased in the numbers of our demat 
accounts. In Insurance, our Premium has escalated 212% with 109% 
growth in policies sold. Our advisory services grew 53% on a pan 
Indian basis. With these achievements to showcase we can well 
say that Choice is on a growth momentum. 
The year under review has been a year of evolution and 
acceleration of our growth. We foresee our robust performance 
will lead us to a ﬁnancial conglomerate worth looking upto in the 
foreseeable future. 
Thanking you

DIRECTOR & CEO
Dear Members, 
I feel privileged to be able to share this annual report with you 
for the 3rd consecutive year as CEO. 
It is with great optimism and enthusiasm that I present this 
year’s review to you. The ﬁnancial services industry in India 
is expected to grow due to a number of factors. Digital 
platforms are playing a key role in the transformation of the 
ﬁnancial sector, driven by factors like the impact of COVID-19, 
changing customer demographics, and increased competition 
from ﬁntech companies. 
It is forecasted that digital payments may pass the $1 trillion 
mark by 2030. The implementation of new business models 
driven by technologies such as Artiﬁcial Intelligence and 
Machine Learning are another growth driver. As of January 
2024, 751.5 million people in India were internet users, which is 
52.4% of the country’s total population. This represents a 2.6% 
increase from January 2023, when 19 million more people 
began using the internet. The government’s Digital India 
initiative and increased internet penetration have contributed 
to this growth. Digital adoption continues to be propelled by 
rural India, with 333 Mn internet users (37% of rural population) 
as of August 2024.
History shows the ﬁnancial services industry has frequently 
been a catalyst for progress, helping organizations and people 
manage economic and societal changes. By decade’s end, FSI 
leaders may look back at 2024 as the year the future started 
to unfold, in real terms. Those who choose to invest in that 
future now—to catalyze the creation of new products and 
services that can enable positive outcomes—could set the 
stage for competitive advantage for some time to come. India 
has the highest FinTech adoption rate globally of 87% which is 
signiﬁcantly higher than the Global average rate of 64%.
Accelerating forward, at “Choice”, our agenda is to spearhead 
ﬁnancial inclusion in mainly Tier 3,4 and 5 cities in the country. 
Here are a few reasons why our growth is Inevitable:
•  Ranked 5th amongst top full service broking ﬁrms in India
•  Strong Research Desk for both Institutional and Retail 
Investors
• MSME focused lending business with tech-led robust 
underwriting process
• Preferred advisor for various Mission Projects of the 
Government
•  Pan India presence
•  Fintech ecosystem with a human touch
We have grown in leaps and bounds in our Revenue, EBIDTA 
and PAT, almost twofold these over the last ﬁscal. This 
growth comes from our bullishness and reserve to provide 
opportunities for ﬁnancial inclusion and serve markets in 
secondary tiers with potential.
We have grown 
in our Revenue, 
EBIDTA 
and PAT, 
phenomenally 
over the last 
fiscal
18  |  CHOICE INTERNATIONAL LIMITED
The tightened regulations and gradual industry consolidation in 
the Broking industry has been largely beneﬁcial for “Choice”. The 
company’s cross sale capability, focus on Tier 3 and 4 markets, 
enhanced revenue streams through diversiﬁcation and focus on 
value added services such as wealth management, research 
and advisory have held the company in good stead. We have 
been steadily increasing our client base in underserved locations 
with majority young adults with rising disposable incomes. Our 
increasing absorption of technology and digitization has proved 
beneﬁcial across many counts with cutting-edge features leading 
to seamless collaborations. We’re also maximising our portfolio 
with a mixed bag of allied products.
India’s Insurance industry is one of the premium sectors 
experiencing upward growth. This upward growth of the insurance 
industry can be attributed to growing incomes and increasing 
awareness in the industry. India is the ﬁfth largest life insurance 
market in the world emerging insurance markets, growing at a 
rate of 32-34% each year. In recent years, the industry has been 
experiencing ﬁercecompetition among its peers which has led to 
new and innovative products within the industry.
At “Choice”, in this area, we tapped into newer territories and were 
propelled by a surge in marquee clients. We are the preferred 
partner to more than 25+ Insurance companies domestically. Our 
fresh lead conversion rate increased to 62% while premium from 
new businesses rose to 86%. In FY24, there was a 154% increase 
(yoy) in enquiries generated. We mainly focused on consolidating 
our institutional business, strengthening our collaborations and 
initiated development of an in house motor portal for a seamless 
online customer experience.
In our infrastructure advisory services, we increased our 
penetration in Maharashtra, Rajasthan and West Bengal, among 
others. We have key association with over 500 Urban Local Bodies, 
25 State Departments and 10,000+ Panchayati Raj institutions. We 
are equipped by a team of Diverse talent pool of IK+ professionals 
including Retired Beaurocrats and professionals from ﬁelds 
like Agriculture, Health, Livelihood, Tribal, Social Sector, Public 
Policy, Treasury, Capacity Building and Scheme Administration 
areas. “Choice” is committed to actively participate in India’s 
remarkable growth story and leveraging our resources, expertise, 
and innovative solutions to make a meaningful impact on 
various aspects of Indian life, from economic development and 
employment opportunities to social well-being and environmental 
sustainability.
In the NBFC segment, we are empowering MSMEs through retail 
lending tailored speciﬁcally for the semi-urban and rural clientele. 
We have robust underwriting processes and a well-diversiﬁed 
liability proﬁle. In short, we’re the ﬁrst preference for MSME lending. 
We aim to be a catalyst for positive change, aligning our success 
with the progress and prosperity of the nation and its people.
Thanking you

6.  Performance of the entity against the speciﬁc commitments, goals and targets along-with reasons in case the same are not met:
P1
As a responsible corporation committed to upholding high ethical standards, the Company prides in itself on adhering to 
industry best practices and implementing the highest standards of Corporate Governance by prioritizing transparency in 
business ethics and ensuring accountability to its valued clients, government entities, and other stakeholders. With a core 
emphasis on compliance, the company is dedicated to maintaining a strong focus on governance principles that go above 
and beyond mere legal provisions. Through a zero-tolerance policy towards bribery and corruption, the Company consistently 
demonstrates ethical behaviour in all its interactions and business transactions. By fostering a culture that values honesty and 
fairness, the Company sets a high standard for business conduct and remains dedicated to fostering trust and credibility in all 
its business relationships.
Transparency: Transparency is a fundamental value that guides the company’s interactions with clients and stakeholders. 
Upholding transparency and fairness is not just a practice; it is a cornerstone of the company’s operations. 
Accountability: Accountability is ingrained in the company’s culture, ensuring that responsibilities are clearly deﬁned and upheld. 
Through the implementation of robust policies and processes, the company enforces high standards of ethics and compliance,

operations. To protect the conﬁdentiality of price-sensitive information, the company has established a comprehensive 
system that not only adheres to legal obligations but also integrates ethical considerations into its practices. The system works

P2
‘Choice group’ a prominent ﬁnancial service provider, focuses solely on delivering comprehensive ﬁnancial services. Its core 
business areas encompass Broking & Distribution, Non-Banking Financial Company & Advisory. Owing to the lack of direct 
involvement in manufacturing, the group does not consume raw materials at its workplace. Embracing a paperless approach 
and emphasizing technological advancements are key priorities for ‘Choice group’. Given the nature of its operations, traditional 
reporting on energy, water, and raw material usage does not apply; however, the company has made environmentally 
conscious decisions such as installing solar panels at its registered ofﬁce and recycling wastewater for reuse, conserving 
water and electricity. As the company’s activities are not heavily manufacturing-focused, sustainable sourcing reporting is not 
deemed applicable. While procurement primarily pertains to ofﬁce infrastructure and equipment, ‘Choice group’ proactively 
engages in responsible sourcing practices whenever possible.
P3
Employees are indeed the most valuable asset of the company, and as such, the company places utmost importance on 
ensuring the health and safety of its workforce. Moreover, the company has made it a point to invest in the continuous 
development and up skilling of its employees across all levels and hierarchies. Regular training sessions are conducted to 
enhance both safety awareness and professional skills, including soft skills that are crucial for personal and professional 
growth. These initiatives also extend to organizing seminars and webinars that focus on educating employees on the latest 
trends in the regulatory framework, as well as providing insights into soft skills development and business advancements. In 
essence, the company’s holistic approach to employee well-being and development reﬂects its core values of prioritizing its 
workforce’s growth and success.
P4
‘Choice group’ is dedicated to being respectful and responsive to all stakeholders, with a particular emphasis on those who 
may be disadvantaged, vulnerable, or marginalized within the community. This commitment stems from the group’s recognition 
that engaging with stakeholders is essential for informing its development initiatives and enhancing its sustainability efforts. 
Regularly monitoring, identifying, and evaluating the needs of disadvantaged groups helps the group ensure that their voices 
are heard and included in decision-making processes. Furthermore, the group has intentionally structured its services to be 
accessible and affordable to clients from low-income backgrounds, demonstrating a commitment to promoting inclusivity 
and social equity within its operations. Through these efforts, ‘Choice group’  aims to foster a culture of respect, inclusivity, and 
empowerment among all stakeholders, regardless of their individual circumstances or background.
P5
The group has clearly deﬁned policies regarding Human Rights. With a paramount emphasis on Justice and Fairness embedded 
in the very essence of the group, there is a collective commitment to uphold these values to ensure that fairness, impartiality, 
and consistency are maintained in all facets of its operations. This dedication to these principles radiates throughout the 
group, leading to the establishment of a nurturing and inclusive work environment where every individual, without exception, 
is treated with the utmost respect and dignity. The group recognizes the importance of safeguarding the human rights of all 
its employees and has made a ﬁrm decision to actively promote and protect these fundamental rights within every facet 
of its organizational structure. By fostering an atmosphere of equality and understanding, the group strives to cultivate a 
culture where diversity is celebrated, and every individual feels valued and empowered. Through these core principles and 
unwavering commitment, the group not only complies with legal obligations but also sets a gold standard for ethical and 
responsible business practices, serving as a beacon of integrity and social responsibility in the corporate world.
P6
The group operates within the service industry rather than engaging in the manufacturing of goods, to being a non-polluting 
entity. This dedication to environmental responsibility is evident through various initiatives implemented by the organisation. 
For instance, the installation of a roof-top solar plant at the corporate ofﬁce not only showcases a proactive approach to 
sustainability but also results in signiﬁcant reductions in CO2 emissions. Furthermore, the design of our ofﬁces prioritizes energy 
efﬁciency, incorporating features such as energy-saving air conditioners and LED lights. The conscious decision to adopt solar 
power emphasizes our goal of fostering an eco-friendly environment. In addition to physical changes, the organisation has 
also embraced technology to enhance operational efﬁciency and promote eco-conscious practices. By implementing various 
software solutions, such as promoting paperless workﬂows and encouraging the use of alternative communication methods 
like email, the organisation demonstrates its commitment to reducing paper consumption and environmental impact. Notably, 
sending Annual Reports to shareholders via email represents a tangible effort in conserving resources and protecting trees. The 
Group actively advocates for ecological sustainability by leveraging digitalization to minimize the use of paper and stationery. 
Proper disposal of e-waste, the widespread installation of energy-efﬁcient LED lights, and a comprehensive approach to 
resource management are integral parts of the group’s commitment to environmental preservation. Collectively, these actions 
contribute signiﬁcantly to environmental conservation by decreasing resource usage and promoting a sustainable future for all.
P7
Given that the group operates within the service industry, it places a strong emphasis on providing comprehensive and 
transparent disclosures to both its valued clients and the regulatory authorities. Through these diligent practices, clients are 
fully informed regarding the complete scope of services offered, with all necessary details being disclosed thoroughly. This 
commitment to transparency underscores the group’s dedication to conducting its operations exceptionally and responsibly, 
ensuring that all activities are conducted with utmost transparency and integrity. Furthermore, the group consistently and 
proactively updates both regulators and clients about any policy changes implemented by the group, thereby maintaining open 
communication channels and fostering trust among all stakeholders involved. This continuous ﬂow of information and updates

future talent pool. Through their CSR endeavors, the company actively contributes to fostering a more sustainable and equitable 
society, emphasizing the value of education and skill development as essential pillars for progress and prosperity. By investing 
in the education and training of young individuals, the group aims to create a more knowledgeable and skilled populace that 
can drive positive change and sustainable development in the long run.
P9

proactive efforts in delivering exceptional results tailored to meet their speciﬁc criteria. As a uniﬁed entity, the group periodically

Corporate Overview

Financial services industry
India has a diversiﬁed ﬁnancial sector undergoing rapid expansion 
both in terms of strong growth of existing ﬁnancial services ﬁrms 
and new entities entering the market. The sector comprises 
commercial banks, insurance companies, non-banking ﬁnancial 
companies, co-operatives, pension funds, mutual funds and other 
smaller ﬁnancial entities. The banking regulator has allowed new 
entities such as payment banks to be created recently, thereby 
adding to the type of entities operating in the sector. However, the 
ﬁnancial sector in India is predominantly a banking sector with 
commercial banks accounting for more than 64% of the total 
assets held by the ﬁnancial system.
The Government of India has introduced several reforms to 
liberalise, regulate and enhance this industry. The Government 
and Reserve Bank of India (RBI) have taken various measures to 
facilitate easy access to ﬁnance for Micro, Small and Medium 
Enterprises (MSMEs). These measures include launching Credit 
Guarantee Fund Scheme for MSMEs, issuing guidelines to banks 
regarding collateral requirements and setting up a Micro Units 
Development and Reﬁnance Agency (MUDRA). With a combined 
push by Government and private sector, India is undoubtedly one 
of the world’s most vibrant capital markets.
Market size
As of March 2024, AUM managed by the mutual funds industry 
stood at Rs. 53.40 lakh crore (US$ 641.75 billion) Inﬂow in India’s 
mutual fund schemes via systematic investment plans (SIP) from 
April 2023 to March 2024 stood at Rs. 2 lakh crore (US$ 24.04 billion).
Equity mutual funds registered a net inﬂow of Rs. 22.16 trillion (US$ 294.15 
billion) by end of December 2021. The net inﬂows were Rs. 7,303.39 
crore (US$ 888 million) in December as compared to a 21-month low 
of Rs. 2,258.35 crore (US$ 274.8 million) in November 2022.
Another crucial component of India’s ﬁnancial industry is the 
insurance industry. The insurance industry has been expanding 
at a fast pace. The total ﬁrst-year premium of life insurance 
companies reached US$ 32.04 billion in FY23. In FY23 (until 
December 2022) non-life insurance sector premiums reached Rs. 
1.87 lakh crore (US$ 22.5 billion).
In FY23, US$ 7.17 billion was raised across 40 initial public offerings 
(IPOs). The number of companies listed on the BSE increased from 
135 in 1995 to 5,357 as of March 2024.
According to the statistics by the Futures Industry Association 
(FIA), a derivatives trade association, the National Stock Exchange 
of India Ltd. (NSE) emerged as the world’s largest derivatives 
exchange in 2020 in terms number of contracts traded. NSE was 
ranked 4th worldwide in cash equities by number of trades as per 
the statistics maintained by the World Federation of Exchanges 
(WFE) for CY20.
Government initiatives
Some of the major Government Initiatives are:
In 2023, the government revamped the credit guarantee scheme. 
The inﬂow of Rs. 9,000 crore (US$ 1,080.97 million) into the corpus 
of the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises 
(CGTMSE) will give MSMEs more access to collateral-free loans.
In September 2021, the international branch of the National 
Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), NPCI International 
Payments (NIPL), has teamed with Liquid Group, a cross-border 
digital payments provider, to enable QR-based UPI payments to 
be accepted in 10 countries in north and southeast Asia.
Road ahead
India’s ﬁnancial services industry has experienced huge growth in 
the past few years. This momentum is expected to continue. India’s 
private wealth management Industry shows huge potential. India 
is expected to have 16.57 lakh HNWIs in 2027. This will indeed lead 
India to be the fourth-largest private wealth market globally by 
2028. India’s insurance market is also expected to reach US$ 250 
billion by 2025. This will further offer India an opportunity of US$ 
78 billion in additional life insurance premiums from 2020-30.
India is today one of the most vibrant global economies on the 
back of robust banking and insurance sectors. The relaxation of 
foreign investment rules has received a positive response from 
the insurance sector, with many companies announcing plans to 
increase their stakes in joint ventures with Indian companies. Over 
the coming quarters, there could be a series of joint venture deals 
between global insurance giants and local players.
The Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) is targeting a 
nearly ﬁve-fold growth in AUM to Rs. 95 lakh crore (US$ 1.15 trillion) 
and more than three times growth in investor accounts to 130 
million by 2025.
Growth of ﬁnancial service sector in India: India’s mobile wallet 
industry is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 23.9% between 2023 
and 2027 to reach US$ 5.7 trillion.

Growth Opportunity: MSME Lending Sector
• 
Despite its importance in shaping country’s socio-economic 
development, MSMEs face a major challenge in obtaining 
sufﬁcient ﬁnancing, with an estimated credit gap of Rs 33 
trillion, according to the IFC.
• 
Exclusion of many MSMEs from formal lending ecosystems 
inhibits their growth; Only ~15% of MSMEs have access to 
formal credit due to lack of data, collateral, or documentation 
and lack of formal credit history as required by traditional 
ﬁnancial institutions.
• 
Fintech and NBFCs are revolutionizing the MSME lending space 
and helping solve creditworthiness issues among banks using 
alternate data processing & technology.

Collaboration between ﬁntech, NBFCs & banks can expand 
the MSME reach, while enabling them with better credit 
decisioning tools 
• 
Unsecured MSME lending in India is expected to reach Rs 7.5 
trillion by FY26 with digital lending channel expected to grow

Future outlook for infrastructure sector in India
The infrastructure sector is a key driver of the Indian economy. 
The sector is highly responsible for propelling India’s overall 
development and enjoys intense focus from the Government for 
initiating policies that would ensure the time-bound creation of 
world-class infrastructure in the country. The infrastructure sector 
includes power, bridges, dams, roads, and urban infrastructure 
development. In other words, the infrastructure sector acts as a 
catalyst for India’s economic growth as it drives the growth of the 
allied sectors like townships, housing, built-up infrastructure, and 
construction development projects.
Infrastructure is a key enabler in helping India become a US $26 
trillion economy. Investments in building and upgrading physical 
infrastructure, especially in synergy with the ease of doing 
business initiatives, remain pivotal to increase efﬁciency and 
costs. Prime Minister Mr. Narendra Modi also recently reiterated 
that infrastructure is a crucial pillar to ensure good governance 
across sectors.
The government’s focus on building infrastructure of the future has 
been evident given the slew of initiatives launched recently. The 
US$ 1.3 trillion national master plan for infrastructure, Gati Shakti, 
has been a forerunner to bring about systemic and effective 
reforms in the sector, and has already shown a signiﬁcant 
headway.
Infrastructure support to the nation’s manufacturers also remains 
one of the top agendas as it will signiﬁcantly transform goods 
and exports movement making freight delivery effective and 
economical.
• 
India has to enhance its infrastructure to reach its 2025 
economic growth target of US$ 5 trillion. 
• 
India’s population growth and economic development require 
improved transport infrastructure, including investments in 
roads, railways, and aviation, shipping and inland waterways.
• 
Development of infrastructure has a multiplier effect on 
demand and efﬁciency of transport and increases commercial 
and entrepreneurship opportunities. 
• 
Under Interim Budget 2024-25, capital investment outlay for 
infrastructure has been increased by 11.1% to Rs.11.11 lakh crore 
(US$ 133.86 billion), which would be 3.4 % of GDP.

and FY30, with a particular emphasis on power, roads, and 
developing industries like renewable energy and electric vehicles.
• 
Prime Minister Mr. Narendra Modi emphasized that India is 
committed to attaining net-zero carbon emissions by 2070, 
and that the country’s ambitious goal of 500 gigawatts (GW) 
of renewable capacity by 2030 should be met. In order to 
make this possible, he unveiled a plan to raise the proportion 
of gas in India’s energy mix to 15% by 2030, which will involve 
spending roughly US$ 67 billion over the course of the 
following ﬁve to six years.

Outlook for FY 2024-25
With a 37% increase in the current ﬁscal year, capital expenditures 
(capex) are on the rise, which bolsters ongoing infrastructure 
development and ﬁts with 2027 goals for India’s economic 
growth to become a US$ 5 trillion economy. In order to anticipate 
private sector investment and to address employment and 
consumption in rural India, the budget places a strong emphasis 
on the development of roads, shipping, and railways.
Global investment and partnerships in infrastructure, such as 
the India-Japan forum for development in the Northeast are 
also indicative of more investments. These initiatives come at 
a momentous juncture as the country aims for self-reliance in 
future-ready and sustainable critical infrastructure.
India, it is estimated, needs to invest US$ 840 billion over the next

15 years into urban infrastructure to meet the needs of its fast-
growing population. This investment will only be rational as well 
as sustainable, if we additionally focus on long-term maintenance 
and strength of our buildings, bridges, ports, and airports.
As a result of digitalisation and opportunities that tier II and 
III cities present for economic growth, the divide between 
metro and non-metros is blurring, moving to the new era of 
infrastructure growth. Commercial real estate properties have 
witnessed exponential growth in demand across Tier II & III cities 
as Information technology and Information technology enabled 
services and banking ﬁnancial services and insurance focused 
organizations are increasingly decentralizing their operations to 
adapt to the new normal.
The residential sector has witnessed good sales, and launches 
have also shown signs of an uptick during 2022, total sales in the 
top-7 cities was projected to exceed 360,000 units in 2022.
Civil Aviation Ministry’s “Vision 2040” report states that there 
will be 190-200 functioning airports in India by 2040. Delhi and 
Mumbai will have three international airports each, while top 31 
Indian cities will have two operational airports each.
220 destinations (airports/heliports/water aerodromes) under 
UDAN are targeted to be completed by 2026 with 1000 routes 
to provide air connectivity to unconnected destinations in India.
India’s Infrastructure forms an integral part of the country’s 
economic ecosystem. There has been a signiﬁcant shift in the 
industry that is leading to the development of world-class facilities 
across the country in the areas of roads, waterways, railways, 
airports, and ports, among others. The country-wide smart cities 
programmes have proven to be industry game-changers. Given 
its critical role in the growth of the nation, the infrastructure 
sector has experienced a tremendous boom because of India’s 
necessity and desire for rapid development. The expansion has 
been aided by urbanisation and an increase in foreign investment 
in the sector.
The infrastructure sector has become the biggest focus area for 
the Government of India. India’s GDP is expected to grow by 8% 
over the next three ﬁscal years, one of the quickest rates among 
major, developing economies, according to S&P Global Ratings. 
India and Japan have joined hands for infrastructure development 
in India’s Northeast states and are also setting up an India-Japan 
Coordination Forum for development of Northeast to undertake 
strategic infrastructure projects for the region.
India being a developing nation is set to take full advantage of 
the opportunity for the expansion of the infrastructure sector, and 
it is reasonable to conclude that India’s infrastructure has a bright 
future ahead of it.
Choice is committed to actively participate in India’s remarkable 
growth story and leveraging our resources, expertise, and 
innovative solutions to make a meaningful impact on various 
aspects of Indian life, from economic development and

Future Outlook for IPOs in India
The future outlook for IPOs in India appears promising, driven by 
several key factors:
Economic Growth and Market Sentiment
India’s robust economic growth continues to attract domestic 
and international investors. As the economy recovers from recent 
global disruptions, positive market sentiment is expected to 
boost IPO activity. Sectors such as technology, healthcare, and 
consumer goods are likely to see increased interest due to their 
strong performance and growth potential.
Regulatory Environment
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has been 
proactive in creating a conducive regulatory environment for IPOs. 
Recent reforms aimed at simplifying the IPO process, enhancing 
transparency, and protecting investor interests are expected 
to encourage more companies to go public. SEBI’s initiatives to 
ease listing norms for startups and small and medium enterprises 
(SMEs) further support this positive outlook.
Technology and Innovation
India’s burgeoning tech ecosystem continues to be a major driver 
of IPO activity. Companies in ﬁntech, e-commerce, edtech, and 
other tech-driven sectors are likely to lead the IPO wave. The 
successful listings of several tech startups in recent years have 
set a positive precedent, encouraging more tech companies to 
explore public offerings.
Rising Retail Investor Participation
There has been a signiﬁcant increase in retail investor participation 
in the Indian stock market, facilitated by digital platforms and 
increased ﬁnancial literacy. This trend is expected to continue, 
providing a strong demand base for upcoming IPOs. Retail 
investors are increasingly looking at IPOs as a viable investment 
opportunity, which bodes well for future listings.
Global Economic Factors
While global economic conditions and geopolitical factors can 
inﬂuence IPO activity, India’s relatively stable economic outlook 
positions it as an attractive market for both issuers and investors. 
The diversiﬁcation of global portfolios into emerging markets like 
India is likely to sustain interest in Indian IPOs.
Government Initiatives
Government initiatives such as “Make in India” and “Digital India” 
are expected to foster a conducive environment for business 
growth and expansion. These initiatives not only support the 
domestic market but also enhance the attractiveness of Indian 
companies to global investors, thereby positively impacting the 
IPO landscape.
Conclusion
Overall, the IPO market in India is poised for signiﬁcant growth. 
With supportive regulatory frameworks, a thriving tech ecosystem, 
increasing retail participation, and a positive economic outlook, the 
stage is set for a vibrant IPO market. Companies across various 
sectors are expected to capitalize on these favorable conditions, 
making the future of IPOs in India bright and promising.
Outlook for FY 2024-2025:
The upcoming ﬁscal year 2024-2025 appears promising, particularly 
in the domains of IPOs and other merchant banking activities. We 
have secured mandates for ﬁve mainboard IPOs, with issue sizes 
ranging from INR 200 crore to INR 400 crore.We are also working 
on a rights issue which is to the tune of INR 450 cr.
We are committed to leveraging these opportunities to drive

stakeholder value, this Committee performs three key functions:
Review of Framework: Our Risk Management Framework is 
amended as per the regulatory and companies needs. Our Risk 
Management Policy is a comprehensive manual that establishes 
a structured approach to risk assessment. This policy outlines both 
qualitative and quantitative aspects of risk at the entity level and 
is further applied through individual or group limits across various 
business lines, products, sectors, geographies, and counterparties.
Risk Analysis: conduct in-depth analyses of identiﬁed risks. 
This analysis considers the potential impact and likelihood of 
occurrence of each risk. 
Mitigation Strategies: deﬁne appropriate mitigation actions 
to minimise the impact or likelihood of each risk. They consider 
factors like the business environment, current operational controls, 
and compliance procedures when developing mitigation 
strategies.
Further, the Audit Committee as well as our Board of Directors 
reviews, discusses and has oversight on the Internal Audit reports 
prepared by the internal auditors. This review process ensures 
that our risk management practices are effective and aligned 
with our strategic goals.
The Group Companies have their own risk management 
frameworks in line with their strategic business operations as 
appropriate to the industry in which they operate. Business 
operations of each of the group companies, the risks faced by 
them and the risk mitigation tools followed by them are reviewed 
periodically by the Boards of the Company. The Company 
encounters several risks, and our strategies for mitigating these 
risks are outlined below:
Regulatory Risk: The fast pace and complex nature of changes 
in the regulatory requirements requires quick identiﬁcation and 
sound understanding of these requirements along with agility 
in adapting into business operations. This risk relates to any 
inadvertently violated laws covering business conduct. Failure 
to comply could result in penalties, reputational damage, and 
criminal prosecution. A comprehensive risk-based compliance 
programme, involving inclusive training and adherence to the 
Code of Conduct, is thus institutionalised by your Company.
Risk Mitigation: A dedicated Team of professionals which 
manages the Compliance reporting and changes within different 
vertical is established within the organisation for building Risk 
and Compliance practice within industry verticals, to provide 
industry speciﬁc solutions. This team is supported by a robust 
Corporate Functions team, ensuring prompt implementation of 
new guidelines, circulars, and notiﬁcations. The Board of Directors 
plays a crucial role in formulating and enforcing applicable 
policies. Additionally, regular internal audits help identify potential 
regulatory issues early, allowing the Company to take proactive 
steps to mitigate risks.
Cyber Attack Risk: Security is a non-negotiable aspect of our 
operations. We employ top-tier tools and processes to protect our 
intellectual property and IT infrastructure. Systemic susceptibility to 
cyberattacks, loss of sensitive information, breakdown in systems 
or unavailability of critical IT means and outputs remains a 
constant risk. Security breach could result in reputational damage, 
penalties, and legal and ﬁnancial liabilities, in addition to impact 
on business operations. 
Risk Mitigation: Your Company has been sensitive to the 
prevailing challenges of systemic issues and cyberattacks to 
its business operations. It has upgraded its safety mechanisms 
and processes, carries periodic internal assessments and builds 
the requisite ﬁrewalls to mitigate any threats and risks. Speciﬁc 
measures have been deployed towards identifying business-
critical IT systems and their disaster recovery plan to ensure 
business-continuity in any eventuality. Multiple training sessions 
and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) have been put in 
place to align the relevant stakeholders to handle any sort of IT 
risk eventuality. Investment in contemporary IT tools like ﬁrewall, 
VPN, identity management, email security, antivirus, etc. to ensure 
adequate protection of underlying data. With advanced threat 
monitoring and prevention measures, we ensure early detection 
and mitigation of cyber-threats across our Group. 
Operational Risk: Operational risk involves uncertainties that 
arise from an organization’s daily business operations. These risks 
can include breakdowns in internal processes, failure to secure 
proper authorizations, inadequately documented transactions, 
lapses in operational and information security procedures, system 
failures, fraud, and employee errors. Unlike external risks, such as 
economic or political events, operational risks are internal and 
depend on the organization’s processes and decisions.
Risk Mitigation: The Company has implemented a comprehensive 
Operational Risk Framework, managed by a high-level team 
of committed professionals with expertise relevant to our 
organizational structure. This team focuses on assessing and 
addressing operational risks to ensure continuity and efﬁciency. 
Well-deﬁned policies and procedures govern our operations, 
which are reviewed regularly. Internal audits are conducted to 
ensure adherence to these policies and processes. Additionally, 
a Maker/Checker mechanism is in place to enforce compliance 
with established systems and procedures across all areas of the 
Company’s operations.
Reputation Risk: Positive or negative perceptions regarding our 
Company and our services can have implications on customer 
relations, revenues, interactions with regulatory bodies and 
decrease in brand value.
Risk Mitigation: We actively monitor social media feedback 
and address concerns swiftly to maintain high levels of customer 
satisfaction. Our focus is on resolving product complaints 
effectively, aiming to transform each resolution into a positive 
experience for our investors and customers. We ensure transparent 
communication and provide timely resolutions to maintain trust 
and conﬁdence among our investors and customers.
Financial Risk: The Company’s primary focus is to foresee the 
unpredictability of ﬁnancial markets and seek to minimize 
potential adverse effects on its ﬁnancial performance. 
The Company is exposed to the following risks arising from 
ﬁnancial instruments:
i. 
Credit risk;
ii. 
Liquidity risk; and 
iii. 
Market risk (including interest rate risk)
Credit risk: Credit risk means the possibility of loss associated 
with diminution in the credit quality of borrowers. Credit risk refers 
to the risk that counterparty with a diminution in the credit quality 
may default on its contractual obligations leading to a ﬁnancial 
loss to the Company. Credit risk arises primarily from ﬁnancial 
assets such as trade receivables, investments, other balances 
with banks, loans and other receivables.
Risk Mitigation: Credit risk management is implemented into the 
process of the Company by examining the credit risk according to 
the ﬁnancial behaviour of the counter parties. To gain a complete 
understanding of overall credit risk by viewing risk at the individual 
customer and portfolio levels. 
The company employs a range of ﬁnancial analysis techniques, 
including ratio and trend analysis, to evaluate ﬁnancial 
performance. We also create detailed projections and analyse 
cash ﬂows extensively. Our analysis includes examining collateral, 
alternative sources of repayment, credit history, and management 
practices. Company identiﬁes the risks in lending situations, draw 
conclusion regarding the likelihood of payment. Additionally, we 
determine appropriate limit system that assist management 
in controlling credit risk exposures, initiating discussion about 
opportunities and risks, and monitoring actual risk taking against 
predetermined credit risk tolerances. All these initiatives enable 
the Company to reduce credit costs, improve efﬁciency. Credit 
risk management processes enforce the Company to establish 
a clear process in for approving new credit as well as for the 
extension to existing credit. Internal audits of the credit risk 
processes are conducted on a periodic basis to determine that 
credit activities are in compliance with the Companies credit 
policies and procedures.
Trade Receivables Risk: Trade receivables risk arises from 
the possibility that customers may fail to meet their payment 
obligations, leading to potential ﬁnancial losses. This risk can 
signiﬁcantly impact cash ﬂow, proﬁtability, and overall ﬁnancial 
stability. Persistent credit issues can affect the company’s credit 
rating and borrowing capacity. 
Risk Mitigation: The company employs a comprehensive 
Expected Credit Losses (ECL) model to determine appropriate 
loss allowances. We also perform regular assessments of 
customer creditworthiness to detect signiﬁcant changes in credit 
risk. Furthermore, we maintain strong customer relationships to 
improve communication and facilitate the early resolution of 
payment issues. 
Liquidity risk: Liquidity risk refers to the Challenges that a 
Company might encounter in fulﬁlling its short-term ﬁnancial 
obligations due to insufﬁcient cash or the inability to convert 
assets into cash without incurring signiﬁcant losses. This risk 
may arise from various scenarios, including market changes, 
unexpected expenses or withdrawals, or a sudden increase 
in liabilities. Liquidity risk refers to the inability of a company to 
either meet its ﬁnancial obligations, including debt servicing, or 
its inability to raise funds from external sources at optimal pricing. 
Lack of liquidity can have signiﬁcant consequences, from the 
inability to meet day-to-day obligations to the loss of investor 
and customer conﬁdence. 
Risk Mitigation: With a prudent approach towards managing 
liquidity risk, Company carefully monitors its cash ﬂow 
management including optimising working capital and by 
maintaining unused, committed ﬁnancing facilities and a liquidity 
buffer. By identiﬁcation of  the types of situations, such as 
economic downturns, both in the whole economy or in particular 
sectors, higher than expected levels of Credit risk management, 
delinquencies and defaults, or the combinations of credit and 
market events, that could produce substantial losses or liquidity 
problems. The Company mitigates liquidity risk by managing 
sufﬁcient cash and marketable securities and availability of funds 
through adequate committed credit facilities to meet obligations 
when due and to close out market positions. Company closely 
monitors it’s debt to equity ratio so that the debt will not become 
over-leveraged and it has enough liquidity to pay its debt 
interest and principle. These measures provide Company with 
a comprehensive overview of liquidity risk, enabling to make 
informed decisions and implement effective strategies to mitigate 
any potential impacts.
Market Risk: Market risk inherent in any investment is the risk that 
the investment will not be as proﬁtable as the investor expected, 
because of ﬂuctuations in the market. Market risk involves the risk 
that prices or rates will adversely change due to economic forces. 
Such risks include adverse effects of movements in equity and 
interest rate markets, currency exchange rates, and commodity 
prices. Market risk can also include the risks associated with the 
cost of borrowing securities, dividend risk, and correlation risk. 
Risk Mitigation: The Company has a well-organized team that 
guarantees that the Portfolios and collaterals / securities are 
continuously monitored. These cautious and judicious liquidity 
risk management measures and practices clearly reﬂects the 
robustness of your Company’s asset liability management.
Interest rate risk: Interest rate risk is the risk to earnings or capital 
arising from movement of interest rates. Interest rate risk is the 
fair value of future cash ﬂows of a ﬁnancial instrument which

ﬂuctuates because of changes in the market interest rates. The 
company is exposed to interest rate risk, which affects the fair 
value or future cash ﬂows of its ﬁnancial instruments due to 
ﬂuctuations in market interest rates. Speciﬁcally, fair value interest 
rate risk involves changes in the value of ﬁxed interest-bearing 
investments resulting from interest rate movements.
Our interest rate risk primarily arises from interest-bearing 
deposits with banks and loans provided to customers. These 
instruments subject the company to fair value interest rate risk. 
However, management assesses that the impact of interest rate 
risk on these ﬁnancial assets is minimal.
Risk Mitigation: To effectively manage interest rate risk, the 
company takes comprehensive measures. We regularly review 
and adjust our interest-bearing instruments in response to 
changing market conditions. This includes monitoring ﬂuctuations 
in interest rates, credit spreads, and yield curves to identify and 
respond to potential opportunities or threats. The Company also 
maintains adequate liquidity to absorb potential challenges from 
interest rate ﬂuctuations and ensures that the company has 
sufﬁcient cash reserves or access to credit facilities.
Risk of Creditworthiness and Business Continuity of Customers: 
The creditworthiness and business continuity of our customers 
may affect our ﬁnancial stability and revenue ﬂow. Issues with 
customer creditworthiness can lead to delayed payments or 
defaults, impacting cash ﬂow and proﬁtability. Disruptions in 
customer business continuity can affect long-term contracts and 
operational stability.
Risk Mitigation: Diversifying our different ﬁnancial services 
portfolio across a range of customers and regions helps to 
spread risk effectively. This approach minimizes creditworthiness 
and business continuity risks by ensuring that our exposure is not 
concentrated in any single area, thereby enhancing our overall 
stability and resilience.
We have implemented multiple channels for providing 
customer feedback including surveys, online portals, and direct 
communication. This ensures we capture a broad spectrum of 
customer insights and concerns.
Transparency and Accountability Risk: Lack of transparency 
and accountability can erode trust with stakeholders, lead to 
compliance issues, and damage the company’s reputation. 
Insufﬁcient disclosures may result in regulatory penalties and 
decreased stakeholder conﬁdence.
Risk Mitigation: Regular and Open Dialogue with Stakeholders 
help us in maintaining ongoing, open communication with all 
stakeholders which build trust and address concerns proactively.
Additionally, we provide disclosures to stakeholders through 
multiple 
channels, 
including 
newspaper 
notices, 
email 
communications, our website, annual reports, quarterly results, 
and exchange disclosures. We also use press releases, investor 
presentations, annual general meetings, and analyst or institutional 
investor meetings/conference call updates. These efforts foster 
transparency, ensure accountability, and build conﬁdence among 
our stakeholders.

Opinion 
We have audited the accompanying standalone ﬁnancial 
statements of Choice International Limited (“the Company”), 
which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2024, the 
Statement of Proﬁt and Loss (including Other Comprehensive 
Income), Statement of Changes in Equity, Statement of Cash Flows 
for the year then ended, and notes to the standalone ﬁnancial 
statements, including material accounting policy information and 
other explanatory information. 
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according 
to the explanations given to us the aforesaid standalone ﬁnancial 
statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 
2013 (“the Act’) in the manner so required and give a true and 
fair view in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards 
prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with Companies 
(Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended (“Ind  AS”) 
and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of 
the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2024, and 
its proﬁt, other comprehensive income, changes in equity and its 
cash ﬂows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone ﬁnancial statements 
in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) speciﬁed 
under section 143(10) of the Act and other applicable authoritative 
pronouncement issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants 
of India (“ICAI”). Our responsibilities under those Standards are 
further described in the ‘Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit 
of the Standalone Financial Statements’ section of our report. 
We are independent of the Company in accordance with the 
Code of Ethics issued by the ICAI together with the ethical 
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone 
ﬁnancial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules 
thereunder, and we have fulﬁlled our other ethical responsibilities 
in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. 
We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us is sufﬁcient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most signiﬁcance in our audit of the 
standalone ﬁnancial statements for the year ended March 31, 
2024. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit 
of the standalone ﬁnancial statements as a whole, and in forming 
our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion 
on these matters. 
We have determined that there are no key audit matters to 
communicate in our report.
Information Other than the Standalone Financial Statements 
and Auditor’s Report Thereon
The Company’s Management and Board of Directors is responsible 
for the other information. The other information comprises the 
information included in Annual report but does not include the 
standalone ﬁnancial statement and our auditor’s report thereon. 
The Annual Report is expected to be made available to us after 
that date of this auditor’s report.
Our opinion on the standalone ﬁnancial statements does not 
cover the other information and we will not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the standalone ﬁnancial statements, 
our responsibility is to read the other information identiﬁed above 
when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the 
other information is materially inconsistent with the standalone 
ﬁnancial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
When we read the Annual report, If we conclude that there is a 
material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate 
the matter to those charge with governance under SA 720 ‘The 
Auditor’s Responsibilities Relating to Other Information’. 
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with 
Governance for the Standalone Financial Statements
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters 
stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation 
of these standalone ﬁnancial statements that give a true and fair 
view of the ﬁnancial position, ﬁnancial performance, changes 
in equity and cash ﬂows of the Company in accordance with 
the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including 
the Accounting Standards speciﬁed under section 133 of the 
Act. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate 
accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the 
Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for 
preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection 
and application of appropriate accounting policies; making 
judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and 
design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal 
ﬁnancial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the 
accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant 
to the preparation and presentation of the standalone ﬁnancial 
statement that give a true and fair view and are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the standalone ﬁnancial statements, the Management 
and Board of Directors are responsible for assessing the 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as 
applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going 
concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either 
intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has 
no realistic alternative but to do so.
The Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the 
Company’s ﬁnancial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone 
Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the standalone ﬁnancial statements as a whole are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and 
to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable 
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT 
To the Members of Choice International Limited
Report on the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that 
an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect 
a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise 
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or 
in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to inﬂuence 
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
standalone ﬁnancial statements. 
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:
• 
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of 
the standalone ﬁnancial statements, whether due to fraud 
or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to 
those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufﬁcient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of 
not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is 
higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve 
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or 
the override of internal control.
• 
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the 
audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate 
in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we 
are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether 
the company has adequate internal ﬁnancial controls with 
reference to standalone ﬁnancial statements in place and the 
operating effectiveness of such controls.
• 
Evaluate the appropriateness of material accounting policies 
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and 
related disclosures made by management and Board of 
Directors.
• 
Conclude on the appropriateness of management and Board 
of Director’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, 
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material 
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may 
cast signiﬁcant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as 
a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty 
exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s 
report to the related disclosures in the standalone ﬁnancial 
statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify 
our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence 
obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, 
future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease 
to continue as a going concern.
• 
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the 
standalone ﬁnancial statements, including the disclosures, and 
whether the standalone ﬁnancial statements represent the 
underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves 
fair presentation.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, 
among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit 
and signiﬁcant audit ﬁndings, including any signiﬁcant deﬁciencies 
in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement 
that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements 
regarding independence, and to communicate with them all 
relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought 
to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related 
safeguards.

ANNEXURE B 
TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT OF EVEN DATE ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF CHOICE INTERNATIONAL LIMITED
[Referred to in paragraph 2(g) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ in the Independent Auditors’ Report of even 
date to the Board of Directors of Choice International Limited on the Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2023] 
Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)
We have audited the internal ﬁnancial controls with reference to 
the standalone ﬁnancial statements of Choice International Limited 
(“the Company”) as of March 31, 2024 in conjunction with our audit 
of the standalone ﬁnancial statements of the Company for the 
year ended on that date.
Opinion
In our opinion, the Company, in all material respects, an adequate 
internal ﬁnancial controls with reference to standalone ﬁnancial 
statements and such internal ﬁnancial controls with reference to 
standalone ﬁnancial statements were operating effectively as 
at March 31, 2024, based on the internal control with reference 
to standalone ﬁnancial statements criteria established by the 
Company considering the essential components of internal control 
stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls 
Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India (ICAI) (the “Guidance Note”).
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls
The Company’s Management is responsible for establishing and 
maintaining internal ﬁnancial controls based on the internal control 
with reference to standalone ﬁnancial statements criteria established 
by the Company considering the essential components of internal 
control stated in the Guidance Note. These responsibilities include 
the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal 
ﬁnancial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the 
orderly and efﬁcient conduct of its business, including adherence 
to Company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention 
and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness 
of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable 
ﬁnancial information, as required under the Act.
Auditors’ Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal 
ﬁnancial controls with reference to standalone ﬁnancial statements 
based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with 
the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing, issued by ICAI 
and deemed to be prescribed under section 143(10) of the Act, 
to the extent applicable to an audit of internal ﬁnancial controls. 
Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply 
with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal 
ﬁnancial controls with reference to standalone ﬁnancial statements 
was established and maintained and if such controls operated 
effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal ﬁnancial controls 
with reference to standalone ﬁnancial statements and their 
operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal ﬁnancial controls with 
reference to standalone ﬁnancial statements included obtaining 
an understanding of internal ﬁnancial controls with reference to 
standalone ﬁnancial statements, assessing the risk that a material 
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and 
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed 
risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, 
including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of 
the standalone ﬁnancial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufﬁcient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the 
Company’s internal ﬁnancial controls with reference to the 
standalone ﬁnancial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to the 
Standalone Financial Statements
A company’s internal ﬁnancial control with reference to standalone 
ﬁnancial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable 
assurance regarding the reliability of ﬁnancial reporting and 
the preparation of standalone ﬁnancial statements for external 
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles. A company’s internal ﬁnancial control with reference 
to standalone ﬁnancial statements includes those policies and 
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in 
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reﬂect the transactions and 
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable 
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit 
preparation of standalone ﬁnancial statements in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and 
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance 
with authorizations of management and directors of the company; 
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or 
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition 
of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the 
standalone ﬁnancial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls With 
reference to Standalone ﬁnancial statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal ﬁnancial controls 
with reference to standalone ﬁnancial statements, including 
the possibility of collusion or improper management override of 
controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur 
and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the 
internal ﬁnancial controls with reference to standalone ﬁnancial 
statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal 
ﬁnancial control with reference to standalone ﬁnancial statements 
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or 
that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may 
deteriorate.

 Basis of preparation and Reclassiﬁcation of Financial 
Statements
i. Statement of compliance
 These standalone ﬁnancial statements have been prepared 
in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards (‘Ind AS’) 
notiﬁed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 ( ‘the 
Act’) read with rule 3 of the Companies ( Indian Accounting 
Standards) Rules, 2015 as amended from time to time and other 
relevant provisions of the Act.
 Accordingly the Company has prepared these Standalone 
Financial Statements which comprise the Balance Sheet as at 
March 31, 2024, the Statement of Proﬁt and Loss for the year 
ended March 31, 2024, the Statement of Cash Flows for the year 
ended March 31, 2024 and the Statement of Changes in Equity 
for the year ended as on that date and accounting policies and 
other explanatory information (together hereinafter referred to 
as ‘Standalone Financial Statements‘).
 The accounting policies are applied consistently to all the 
periods presented in the standalone ﬁnancial statements.
 New and Amended Standards adopted by the Company
 No new standards as notiﬁed by Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”), 
through Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment 
Rules, 2022 and Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Second 
Amendment Rules are effective for the current year.
 The Company has applied the following amendments to Ind AS 
for the ﬁrst time for their annual reporting period commencing

 New amendments issued but not effective                                                                   
 The Ministry of Corporate Affairs has vide notiﬁcation dated 
March 23, 2022 notiﬁed Companies (Indian Accounting 
Standards) Amendment Rules, 2023 which amends certain 
accounting standards, and are effective April 1, 2023. These 
amendments are not expected to have a material impact on 
the Company in the current or future reporting periods and on 
foreseeable future transactions.
ii. Functional and presentation currency
 The Company’s presentation and functional currency is Indian 
Rupees. All ﬁgures appearing in the Standalone ﬁnancial 
statements are in Indian rupees in lakh rounded off to two 
decimal places as permitted by Schedule III to the Act. Per share 
data are presented in Indian Rupee to two decimal places.
iii. Basis of measurement
 The standalone ﬁnancial statements have been prepared 
on Historical cost convention on the accrual basis as per the 
provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)” except for 
certain ﬁnancial assets and liabilities are measured at fair 
value as explained in the accounting policy. Historical cost is 
generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in 
exchange for goods and services. Further assets and liabilities 
are classiﬁed as per the normal operating cycle (determined as 
12 months). 
iv. Fair value measurement
 Fair value is the price that would be received on sale of an 
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the measurement date in the 
principal or, in its absence, the most advantageous market to 
which the Company has access at that date. 
 The best estimate of the fair value of a ﬁnancial instrument 
on initial recognition is normally the transaction price. If the 
Company determines that the fair value on initial recognition 
differs from the transaction price and the fair value is 
evidenced neither by a quoted price in an active market for an 
identical asset or liability nor based on a valuation technique 
that uses only data from observable markets, then the ﬁnancial 
instrument is initially measured at fair value, adjusted to defer 
the difference between the fair value on initial recognition 
and the transaction price. Subsequently that difference is 
recognised in Statement of Proﬁt and Loss on an appropriate 
basis over the life of the instrument but no later than when the 
valuation is wholly supported by observable market data or 
the transaction is closed out. 
 All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured 
or disclosed in the standalone ﬁnancial statements are 
categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, 
based on the lowest level input that is signiﬁcant to the fair 
value measurement as a whole:
• 
Level 1 - Valuation using quoted market price in active 
markets: The fair value for ﬁnancial instruments traded in 
active markets at the reporting date is based on their quoted

market price, without any deduction for transaction costs. A 
market is regarded as active, if transactions for the asset or 
liability take place with sufﬁcient frequency and volume to 
provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
• 
Level 2 - Valuation using observable inputs: If there is no 
quoted price in an active market, then the Company uses 
valuation techniques that maximise the use of relevant 
observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable 
inputs. The chosen valuation technique incorporates most of 
the factors that market participants would take into account 
in pricing a transaction.
• 
Level 3 - Valuation with signiﬁcant unobservable inputs: The 
valuation techniques are used only when fair value cannot 
be determined by using observable inputs. The Company 
regularly reviews signiﬁcant unobservable inputs and 
valuation adjustments. Level 3 assets are typically very illiquid, 
and fair values can only be calculated using estimates. 
The Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in 
the circumstances and for which sufﬁcient data are available to 
measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable 
inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs. 
v. Use of judgment and Estimates 
 
The preparation of the standalone ﬁnancial statements 
requires the management to make judgments, estimates 
and assumptions in the application of accounting policies 
that affects the reported amount of assets, liabilities and the 
accompanying disclosures along with contingent liabilities as 
at the date of standalone ﬁnancial statements and revenue 
& expenses for the reporting period. Although these estimates 
are based on the management’s best knowledge of current 
events and actions, uncertainty about these assumptions 
and estimates could result in outcomes different from the 
estimates. Difference between actual results and estimates 
are recognised in the year in which the results are known or 
materialise i.e. prospectively.
 
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and 
are based on historical experience and other factors, 
including expectations of future events that are believed 
to be reasonable under the circumstances. The key areas 
involving estimation uncertainty, higher degree of judgement 
or complexity, or areas where assumptions are signiﬁcant to 
the standalone ﬁnancial statements include:
i) 
Impairment of ﬁnancial assets
ii) Estimation of fair value measurement of ﬁnancial assets and 
liabilities 
iii) Provisions and Contingencies
iv) Useful life and expected residual value of assets
v) Tax position for current tax and recognition of deferred tax 
assets/liabilities
vi) Measurement of Deﬁned Beneﬁt Obligations and actuarial 
assumptions
vii) Share Based Payments
viii) Measurement of Expected Credit Loss allowance for Trade 
receivables
A. Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies
1. Current versus non-current classiﬁcation
 The Company presents assets and liabilities in the balance 
sheet based on current /non-current classiﬁcation.
An asset is treated as current when it is:
• 
 Expected to be realized or intended to be sold or consumed 
in normal operating cycle.
• 
 Held primarily for the purpose of trading
• 
 Expected to be realized within twelve months after the 
reporting date, or
• 
 Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being 
exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve 
months after the reporting period
All other assets are classiﬁed as non-current.
A liability is current when:
• 
 It is expected to be settled in normal operating cycle
• 
 It is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting 
period, or
• 
 There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the 
liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period
All other liabilities are classiﬁed as non–current.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classiﬁed as non-current 
assets and liabilities. 
Based on the nature of products and services offered by the 
Company, operating cycle determined is 12 months for the 
purpose of current and non-current classiﬁcation of assets and 
liabilities.
The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition of assets 
for processing and their realisation in cash and cash equivalents, 
2. Revenue recognition
 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration 
received or receivable. Revenue is recognized to the extent 
that it is probable that the economic beneﬁts will ﬂow to the 
Company and the revenue can be reliably measured and 
there exists reasonable certainty of its recovery.
 
 Sale of services
 
The Company recognizes revenue on accrual basis when the 
signiﬁcant terms of the arrangement are enforceable, services 
have been delivered and the collectability is reasonably 
assured. The method of recognizing the revenues and costs 
depends on the nature of the services rendered. Revenue is 
recognized when no signiﬁcant uncertainty exists as to its 
realization or collection.
 
The Company recognizes income from Business Support 
Service on account of providing ‘administrative services’ to its 
Subsidiaries and Group companies. The term administrative 
services will be as per the terms of agreement made between 
the Company with its subsidiaries and Group Companies
  Interest Income
 Interest income from ﬁnancial assets is recognized when it is 
probable that economic beneﬁts will ﬂow to the company 
and the amount of income can be measured reliably. Interest 
income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal 
outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which 
is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts 
through the expected life of the ﬁnancial assets to that asset’s 
net carrying amount on initial recognition.
3.  Property, Plant and Equipment
 Land and buildings held for use in the supply of services, or for 
administrative purposes, are stated in the Balance Sheet at cost 
less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment 
losses. Freehold land is not depreciated.
 All items of property, plant and equipment are initially recorded 
at cost. The cost of property, plant and equipment comprises 
its purchase price net of any trade discounts and rebates, any 
import duties and other taxes (other than those subsequently 
recoverable from the tax authorities), any directly attributable 
expenditure on making the asset ready for its intended use, 
including relevant borrowing costs for qualifying assets and 
any expected costs of decommissioning. Expenditure incurred 
after the property, plant and equipment have been put into 
operation, such as repairs and maintenance, are charged to the 
Statement of Proﬁt and Loss in the year in which the costs are 
incurred.” The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment 
is recognized as an asset if, and only if, it is probable that future 
economic beneﬁts associated with the item will ﬂow to the 
company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
 All items of property, plant and equipment having cost more 
than Rs. 5000/- are recognized as an asset.
 Properties in the course of construction for production, supply or 
administrative purposes are carried at cost, less any recognized 
impairment loss. Cost includes professional fees and, for 
qualifying assets, borrowing costs capitalized in accordance 
with the company`s accounting policy. Such properties are 
classiﬁed to the appropriate categories of property, plant 
and equipment when completed and ready for intended 
use. Depreciation of these assets, on the same basis as other 
property assets, commences when the assets are ready for 
their intended use.
 Capital Work in Progress and Capital Advances
 Capital work-in-progress are property, plant and equipment 
which are not yet ready for their intended use. Advances 
given towards acquisition of ﬁxed assets outstanding at each 
reporting date are shown as other non-ﬁnancial assets. 
 Depreciation is not recorded on capital work-in progress until 
construction and installation is completed and assets are ready 
for its intended use.
 Subsequent to recognition, property, plant and equipment 
(excluding freehold land) are measured at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. When 
signiﬁcant parts of property, plant and equipment are required 
to be replaced in intervals, the company recognizes such parts 
as individual assets with speciﬁc useful lives and depreciation 
respectively. Likewise, when a major inspection is performed, 
its cost is recognized in the carrying amount of the plant 
and equipment as a replacement cost only if the recognition 
criteria are satisﬁed. All other repair and maintenance costs are 
recognized in the Statement of Proﬁt and Loss as incurred.
 Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost of assets 
less their residual values over the useful lives as prescribed in 
Schedule II of to the Companies Act, 2013, using the straight- 
line method (“SLM”). Residual value is considered nil case of 
Computers, Server and network and 5% is considered in case 
of other assets.

Corporate Overview
Financial Statements
Notice
Statutory Reports
The cost of property, plant and equipment at April 01, 2018, the 
Company’s date of transition to Ind AS, was determined with 
reference to its carrying value recognised as per the previous 
GAAP (deemed cost), as at the date of transition to Ind AS.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed 
for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The residual 
values, useful life and depreciation method are reviewed at each 
ﬁnancial year-end to ensure that the amount, method and period 
of depreciation are consistent with previous estimates and the 
expected pattern of consumption of the future economic beneﬁts 
embodied in the items of property, plant and equipment.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon 
disposal or when no future economic beneﬁts are expected 
to arise from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss 
arising on disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant 
and equipment is determined as the difference between sale 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised 
in proﬁt or loss. 
4. Investment Properties-
 
Investment properties are properties that is held for long-term 
rentals yields or for capital appreciation (including property 
under construction for such purposes) or both, and that is not 
occupied by the Company, is classiﬁed as investment property. 
Investment properties are measured initially at cost, including 
transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment 
properties are stated at cost less accumulated impairment 
loss, if any. Though the Company measures investment 
property using cost based measurement, the fair value of 
investment property is disclosed in the notes. Investment 
properties are derecognised either when they have been 
disposed of or when they are permanently withdrawn from 
use and no future economic beneﬁt is expected from their 
disposal. The difference between the net disposal proceeds 
and the carrying amount of the asset is recognised in proﬁt or 
loss in the period of derecognition.
5. Intangible Assets
 
The cost Intangible assets at April 01, 2018, the Company’s date 
of transition to Ind AS, was determined with reference to its 
carrying value recognised as per the previous GAAP (deemed 
cost), as at the date of transition to Ind AS.
 
Intangible asset including intangible assets under development 
are stated at cost, net of accumulated amortisation and 
accumulated impairment losses, if any. Intangible assets 
acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at 
cost. The amortization period and the amortisation method 
are reviewed at the end of each ﬁnancial year. The useful lives 
of intangible assets are assessed as either ﬁnite or indeﬁnite. 
Intangible assets with ﬁnite lives are amortised over the useful 
economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there 
is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. 
The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an 
intangible asset with a ﬁnite useful life are reviewed at least 
at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the expected 
useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future 
economic beneﬁts embodied in the asset are considered to 
modify the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, 
and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The 
amortisation expense on intangible assets with inﬁnite lives 
is recognised in the statement of proﬁt and loss unless such 
expenditure forms part of carrying value of another asset.
 
Useful life in case of Intangible assets is considered as 6.17 
year.
 
Non-monetary assets and liabilities are carried at historical 
cost using exchange rates as on the date of the respective 
transactions and are not retranslated at the reporting date.
6. Income Tax
 
The income tax expense or credit for the period is the tax 
payable on the current period’s taxable income based on the 
applicable income tax rate for each jurisdiction adjusted by 
changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to 
temporary differences and to unused tax losses.”
 
Current taxes
 
The tax currently payable is based on taxable proﬁt for the 
year. Taxable proﬁt differs from ‘proﬁt before tax’ as reported 
in the Statement of Proﬁt and Loss because of items of 
income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other 
years and items that are never taxable or deductible.
 
Current income tax is recognized at the amount expected to 
be paid to or recovered from the tax authorities, using the tax 
rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date. The Company offsets, 
on a year to year basis, the current tax assets and liabilities, 
where it has legally enforceable right to do so and where it 
intends to settle such assets and liabilities on a net basis.
 
Income tax expense is recognized in net proﬁt in the statement 
of proﬁt and loss except to the extent that it relates to items 
recognized directly in other comprehensive income or equity, 
in which case it is recognized in other comprehensive income 
or equity respectively.
 
The promulgated Taxation Law (Amendment) Ordinance 
2019 has inserted section 115BBA in the Income Tax Act, 1961 
providing existing domestic companies with an option to pay 
tax at a concessional rate of 22% plus applicable surcharge 
and cess. The Company has irreversibly opted for the new tax 
rate i.e. 25.17%.
 
Deferred taxes
 
Deferred tax is recognized on differences between the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the standalone 
ﬁnancial statements and the corresponding tax bases used 
in the computation of taxable proﬁt and are accounted for 
using the balance sheet approach. Deferred tax liabilities are 
generally recognized for all taxable temporary differences, 
and deferred tax assets are generally recognized for all 
deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is 
probable that taxable proﬁts will be available against which 
those deductible temporary differences can be utilized. Such 
assets and liabilities are not recognized if the temporary 
difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition 
(other than in a business combination) of other assets and 
liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable proﬁt 
nor the accounting proﬁt. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the 
period in which the liability is settled or the asset is realised, 
based on the tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.
 
Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside the proﬁt 
and loss is recognised outside proﬁt and loss (either in other 
comprehensive income or in equity)
 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at 
each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it 
is no longer probable that sufﬁcient taxable proﬁts will be 
available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a 
legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes 
levied by the same taxation authority and the Company 
intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net 
basis. 
 
Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) credit entitlement (i.e. excess of 
MAT paid for a year over normal tax liability for that year) 
eligible for set off in subsequent years is recognised as an 
asset in accordance with Ind AS 12, Income Taxes, if there is 
convincing evidence of it’s realisation.
 
MAT credit is created by way of credit to the Statement of 
Proﬁt and Loss. The Company reviews the same at each 
Balance Sheet date and writes down the carrying amount 
of MAT credit entitlement to the extent there is no longer 
convincing evidence to the effect that Company will pay 
normal income tax during the speciﬁed period.
7.  Impairment of Non-Financial Assets
 
At the end of each reporting period, the company reviews 
the carrying amounts of its property, plant and equipment, 
investment property and intangible assets to determine 
whether there is any indication that those assets have 
suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, 
the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to 
determine the extent of impairment loss (if any). When it is not 
possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual 
asset, the company estimates the recoverable amount of 
the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. When 
a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be 
identiﬁed, corporate assets are also allocated to individual 
cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to 
the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a 
reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identiﬁed.
 
Intangible assets with indeﬁnite useful lives and intangible 
assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment at 
least annually, and whenever there is an indication that the 
asset may be impaired.
 
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs 
of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the 
estimated future cash ﬂows are discounted to their present 
value using a pre-tax discount rate that reﬂects current 
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
speciﬁc to the asset for which the estimates of future cash 
ﬂows have not been adjusted. 
 
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) 
is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying 
amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its 
recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognized in the 
statement of proﬁt and loss.
 
When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying 
amount of the asset ( or a cash-generating unit) is increased 
to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount,  so that 
the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying 
amount that would have been determined had no impairment 
loss been recognised for the asset ( or cash-generating unit) 
in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised 
immediately in statement of proﬁt and loss.
8.  Financial Instruments
 
A ﬁnancial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a 
ﬁnancial asset of one entity and a ﬁnancial liability or equity 
instrument of another entity. 
 
Financial Assets
a) Initial recognition and measurement
 
All ﬁnancial assets are recognised initially at fair value. 
Purchases or sales of ﬁnancial assets that require delivery 
of assets within a time frame established by regulation or 
convention in the market place (regular way trades) are 
recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Company 
commits to purchase or sell the asset.
 
On initial recognition, a ﬁnancial asset is  measured at:
•  Amortised cost
•  Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income – debt 
instruments
•  Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income – equity 
instruments
•  Fair Value Through Proﬁt and Loss
 
Amortised cost - The Company’s business model is not 
assessed on an instrument-by-instrument basis, but at a higher 
level of aggregated portfolios being the level at which they 
are managed. The ﬁnancial asset is held with the objective to 
hold ﬁnancial asset in order to collect contractual cash ﬂows 
as per the contractual terms that give rise on speciﬁed dates 
to cash ﬂows that are solely payment of principal and interest 
(SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding. Accordingly, the 
Company measures Bank balances, Loans, Trade receivables 
and other ﬁnancial instruments at amortised cost.
 
FVOCI - debt instruments - The Company measures its debt 
instruments at FVOCI when the instrument is held within a 
business model, the objective of which is achieved by both

Statutory Reports
collecting contractual cash ﬂows and selling ﬁnancial assets; 
and the contractual terms of the ﬁnancial asset meet the SPPI 
test.
 
FVOCI - equity instruments - The Company subsequently 
measures all equity investments at fair value through proﬁt 
or loss, unless the Company’s management has elected to 
classify irrevocably some of its equity instruments at FVOCI, 
when such instruments meet the deﬁnition of Equity under Ind 
AS 32 Financial Instruments and are not held for trading.
 
Financial assets are not reclassiﬁed subsequent to their initial 
recognition, except if and in the period the Company changes 
its business model for managing ﬁnancial assets.
 
All ﬁnancial assets not classiﬁed as measured at amortised 
cost or FVOCI are measured at FVTPL. This includes all 
derivative ﬁnancial assets.
b) Subsequent measurement
 
Financial assets at amortised cost are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using effective interest method. 
The amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest 
income, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment 
are recognised in Statement of Proﬁt and Loss. Any gain and 
loss on derecognition is recognised in Statement of Proﬁt and 
Loss.
 
Debt investment at FVOCI are subsequently measured at fair 
value. Interest income under effective interest method, foreign 
exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised 
in Statement of proﬁt and loss. Other net gains and losses 
are recognised in OCI. On derecognition, gains and losses 
accumulated in OCI are reclassiﬁed to Statement of Proﬁt 
and Loss.
 
For equity investments, the Company makes selection on 
an instrument-by-instrument basis to designate equity 
investments as measured at FVOCI. These selected investments 
are measured at fair value with gains and losses arising from 
changes in fair value recognised in other comprehensive 
income and accumulated in the reserves. The cumulative gain 
or loss is not reclassiﬁed to Statement of proﬁt and loss on 
disposal of the investments. These investments in equity are 
not held for trading. Dividend income received on such equity 
investments are recognised in Statement of Proﬁt and Loss. 
Equity investments that are not designated as measured at 
FVOCI are designated as measured at FVTPL and subsequent 
changes in fair value are recognised in Statement of Proﬁt 
and Loss.
 
Financial assets at FVTPL are subsequently measured at fair 
value. Net gains and losses, including any interest or dividend 
income, are recognised in Statement of Proﬁt and Loss.
c) De-recognition of ﬁnancial assets
 
A ﬁnancial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a ﬁnancial asset or 
part of a group of similar ﬁnancial assets) is primarily derecognised 
(i.e. removed from the company balance sheet) when:
 
The rights to receive cash ﬂows from the asset have expired, 
or
 
The Company has transferred its rights to receive cash ﬂows 
from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the 
received cash ﬂows in full without material delay to a third 
party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement and either (a) the 
company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards 
of the asset, or (b) the company has neither transferred nor 
retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, 
but has transferred control of the asset
 
When the Company has transferred its rights to receive 
cash ﬂows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through 
arrangement, it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained 
the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has neither 
transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and 
rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, 
the company continues to recognise the transferred asset to 
the extent of the company`s continuing involvement. In that 
case, the company also recognises an associated liability. The 
transferred asset and the associated liability are measured 
on a basis that reﬂects the rights and obligations that the 
company has retained.
 
Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee 
over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the 
original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum 
amount of consideration that the company could be 
required to repay.
d) Impairment of ﬁnancial assets
 
The Company recognises impairment loss applying the 
expected credit loss (ECL) model on the ﬁnancial assets 
measured at amortised cost, debt instruments at FVTOCI, 
lease receivables, trade receivables, other contractual right to 
receive cash or other ﬁnancial asset and ﬁnancial guarantee 
not designated as at FVTPL. 
 
The Company measures the loss allowance for a ﬁnancial 
instrument at an amount equal to the lifetime expected 
credit losses if the credit risk on that ﬁnancial instrument has 
increased signiﬁcantly since initial recognition. If the credit risk 
on a ﬁnancial instrument has not increased signiﬁcantly since 
initial recognition, the Company measures the loss allowance 
for that ﬁnancial instrument at an amount equal to 12 months 
expected credit losses.
 
For trade receivables or any contractual right to receive cash 
or other ﬁnancial assets that result from transactions that are 
within the scope of Ind AS 115, the Company always measures 
the loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected 
credit losses.
 
Further, for the purpose of measuring lifetime expected credit 
loss allowance for trade receivables, the Company applies 
‘simpliﬁed approach’ permitted by Ind AS 109 Financial 
Instruments. This expected credit loss allowance is computed 
based on a provision matrix which takes into account 
historical credit loss experience and adjusted for forward-
looking information. 
 
In view of the fact that the entire trade receivables are from 
its subsidiaries and other group companies, there is no lifetime 
credit losses expected by the Company.
 
Write offs – The gross carrying amount of a ﬁnancial asset 
is written-off (either partially or in full) to the extent that there 
is no reasonable expectation of recovering the asset in its 
entirety or a portion thereof. This is generally the case when 
the Company determines that the vendor does not have 
assets or sources of income that could generate sufﬁcient 
cash ﬂows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off 
and when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery 
from the collaterals held. However, ﬁnancial assets that are 
written-off could still be subject to enforcement activities in 
order to comply with the Company’s procedures for recovery 
of amounts due.
 
Presentation of allowance for ECL in the Balance Sheet – 
Loss allowances for ECL are deducted from the gross carrying 
amount of ﬁnancial assets measured at amortised cost.
 
Financial Liabilities
a) Initial recognition and measurement
 
All ﬁnancial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, 
in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of 
directly attributable transaction costs.
b) Subsequent measurement
 
The measurement of ﬁnancial liabilities depends on their 
classiﬁcation, as described below:
 
Financial liabilities at fair value through proﬁt or loss
 
Financial liabilities at fair value through proﬁt or loss include 
ﬁnancial liabilities held for trading and ﬁnancial liabilities 
designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through 
proﬁt or loss. Financial liabilities are classiﬁed as held for 
trading if they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in 
the near term. This category also includes derivative ﬁnancial 
instruments entered into by the Company that are not 
designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as 
deﬁned by Ind-AS 109. Separated embedded derivatives are 
also classiﬁed as held for trading unless they are designated 
as effective hedging instruments.
 
Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in 
the proﬁt or loss.
 
Financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at 
fair value through proﬁt or loss are designated at the initial 
date of recognition, and only if the criteria in Ind AS 109 are 
satisﬁed. For liabilities designated as FVTPL, fair value gains/ 
losses attributable to changes in own credit risk is recognized 
in OCI. These gains/ loss are not subsequently transferred to 
P&L. However, the company may transfer the cumulative gain 
or loss within equity. All other changes in fair value of such 
liability are recognised in the statement of proﬁt or loss. The 
Company has not designated any ﬁnancial liability as at fair 
value through proﬁt and loss.
 
Financial liabilities are subsequently carried at amortized cost 
using the effective interest method, except for contingent 
consideration recognized in a business combination which is 
subsequently measured at fair value through proﬁt and loss. 
For trade and other payables maturing within one year from 
the Balance Sheet date, the carrying amounts approximate 
fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.
 
Derecognition
 
A ﬁnancial liability is derecognised when and only when 
the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled 
or expires. When an existing ﬁnancial liability is replaced 
by another from the same lender on substantially different 
terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially 
modiﬁed, such an exchange or modiﬁcation is treated as the 
derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a 
new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts 
is recognised in the statement of proﬁt or loss
 
Offsetting of ﬁnancial instruments
 
Financial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities are offset and the net 
amount is reported in the balance sheet if there is a currently 
enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and 
there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the 
assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
 
Loans and borrowings
 
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings 
are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest rate method. Gains and losses are recognised 
in proﬁt or loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as 
through the effective interest rate amortisation process.
 
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any 
discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are 
an integral part of the effective interest rate. Such amortisation 
is included as ﬁnance costs in the statement of proﬁt and loss.
9.  Finance Costs 
 
Finance costs include interest expense computed by applying 
the effective interest rate on respective ﬁnancial instruments 
measured at amortised cost. Financial instruments include 
debt and borrowing, Finance costs are charged to the 
Statement of Proﬁt and Loss. 
10. Provisions 
 
Provisions are recognised only when: 
•  an entity has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as 
a result of a past event; and
•  it is probable that an outﬂow of resources embodying 
economic beneﬁts will be required to settle the obligation; 
and
•  a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the 
obligation
    These are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and adjusted 
to reﬂect the current best estimates.
 
Further, long term provisions are determined by discounting 
the expected future cash ﬂows speciﬁc to the liability. The 
unwinding of the discount is recognised as ﬁnance cost. A 
provision for onerous contracts is measured at the present 
value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the 
contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the 
contract. Before a provision is established, the Company 
recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with 
that contract.

Corporate Overview
Financial Statements
Notice
Statutory Reports
Contingent liability is disclosed in case of: 
• 
a present obligation arising from past events, when it is not 
probable that an outﬂow of resources will be required to 
settle the obligation; and
• 
a present obligation arising from past events, when no reliable 
estimate is possible.
Contingent Assets: 
Contingent assets are assessed continually to ensure that 
developments are appropriately reﬂected in the ﬁnancial 
statements. If it has become virtually certain that an inﬂow of 
economic beneﬁts will arise, the asset and the related income 
are recognised in the ﬁnancial statements of the period in which 
the change occurs. If an inﬂow of economic beneﬁts has become 
probable, an entity discloses the contingent asset.
11.  Commitments:
 
Commitments are future liabilities for contractual expenditure, 
classiﬁed and disclosed as follows:
•  estimated amount of contracts remaining to be executed 
on capital account and not provided for; 
•  uncalled liability on loan sanctioned and on investments 
partly paid; and 
•  other non-cancellable commitments, if any, to the extent 
they are considered material and relevant in the opinion 
of management.
12.  Earnings Per Share
 
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net 
proﬁt or loss for the year attributable to equity shareholders by 
the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding 
during the year.
 
Diluted earnings per share adjusts the ﬁgures used in the 
determination of basic earnings per share to take into account
•  The after income tax effect of interest and other ﬁnancing 
costs associated with dilutive potential equity shares, and
•  Weighted average number of equity shares that would 
have been outstanding assuming the conversion of all the 
dilutive potential equity.
13.  Cash and Cash Equivalents
 
Cash comprises cash on hand and demand deposits with 
banks. Cash equivalents are short-term balances (with an 
original maturity of three months or less from the date of 
acquisition), and highly liquid time deposits that are readily 
convertible into known amounts of cash and which are 
subject to insigniﬁcant risk of changes in value. 
14. Statement of Cash Flow
 
Statement of Cash Flows is prepared segregating the cash 
ﬂows into operating, investing and ﬁnancing activities. Cash 
ﬂow from operating activities is reported using indirect 
method adjusting the net proﬁt for the effects of:
i.  changes during the period in inventories and operating 
receivables and payables transactions of a noncash 
nature;
ii.  non-cash items such as depreciation, provisions, deferred 
taxes, unrealised foreign currency gains and losses, and 
undistributed proﬁts of associates and joint ventures; and
iii.  all other items for which the cash effects are investing or 
ﬁnancing cash ﬂows.
 
Cash and cash equivalents (including bank balances) shown 
in the Statement of Cash Flows exclude items which are not 
available for general use as on the date of Balance Sheet.
15.  Employee Beneﬁts 
 
Short term employee beneﬁts
 
Employee beneﬁts falling due wholly within twelve months of 
rendering the service are classiﬁed as short term employee 
beneﬁts and are expensed in the period in which the 
employee renders the related service. Liabilities recognised in 
respect of short-term employee beneﬁts are measured at the 
undiscounted amount of the beneﬁts expected to be paid in 
exchange for the related service.
 
Long Term employee beneﬁts
 
Company’s net obligation in respect of long-term employee 
beneﬁts is the amount of future beneﬁt that employees have 
earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. 
 
Post-employment beneﬁts
a) Deﬁned contribution Plans
  Provident fund: Contributions as required under the 
statute, made to the Provident Fund (Deﬁned Contribution 
Plan) are recognised immediately in the Statement of 
Proﬁt and Loss. There is no obligation other than the 
monthly contribution payable to the Regional Provident 
Fund Commissioner.
  ESIC and Labour welfare fund:  The Company’s 
contribution paid/payable during the year to Employee 
state insurance scheme and Labour welfare fund are 
recognised in the Statement of Proﬁt and Loss.
b) Deﬁned beneﬁt Plans
  Gratuity liability is deﬁned beneﬁt obligation and is 
provided on the basis of an actuarial valuation performed 
by an independent actuary based on projected unit credit 
method, at the end of each ﬁnancial year. 
Deﬁned beneﬁt costs are categorised as follows:
i)  Service cost (including current service cost, past service cost, 
as well as gains and losses on curtailments and settlements)
ii)  Net interest expense or income
iii)  Re-measurement 
 
Re-measurements of the net deﬁned beneﬁt liability, which 
comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets 
(excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, 
excluding interest), are recognized in OCI, net of taxes. The 
Company determines the net interest expense (income) 
on the net deﬁned beneﬁt liability (asset) for the period by 
applying the discount rate used to measure the deﬁned 
beneﬁt obligation at the beginning of the annual period to 
the net deﬁned beneﬁt liability (asset), taking into account 
any changes in the net deﬁned beneﬁt liability (asset) during 
the period as a result of contributions and beneﬁt payments. 
Net interest expense and other expenses related to deﬁned 
beneﬁt plans are recognized in Statement of Proﬁt and Loss. 
 
The Company’s net obligation in respect of gratuity (deﬁned 
beneﬁt plan), is calculated by estimating the amount of future 
beneﬁt that the employees have earned in the current and 
prior periods, discounting that amount and deducting the fair 
value of any plan assets. The retirement beneﬁt obligation 
recognised in the Balance Sheet represents the actual deﬁcit 
or surplus in the company’s deﬁned beneﬁt plans. Any surplus 
resulting from this calculation is recognised as an asset to the 
extent of present value of any economic beneﬁts available in 
the form of refunds from the plans or reductions in the future 
contribution to the plans.
     Share based payment arrangements
 
The cost of equity settled transactions is determined by the 
fair value at the grant date. The fair value of the employee 
share options is based on the Black Scholes model.
 
The grant-date fair value of equity-settled share-based 
payment granted to employees is recognized as an expense, 
with a corresponding increase in equity, over the vesting 
period of the awards. The amount recognized as an expense 
is adjusted to reﬂect the number of awards for which the 
related service and non-market performance conditions 
are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately 
recognized is based on the number of awards that meet 
the related service and non-market performance conditions 
at the vesting date. For share-based payment awards with 
market performance conditions and non-vesting conditions, 
the grant-date fair value of the share-based payment is 
measured to reﬂect such conditions and there is no true-up 
for differences between expected and actual outcomes.
 
Choice International Limited grants options to eligible 
employees of the Company under Choice Employee Stock 
Option Scheme 2022. The options vest over a period of four 
years. In case of Group equity-settled share-based payment 
transactions, where the Company grants stock options to the 
employees of its subsidiaries, the transactions are accounted 
by increasing the cost of investment in subsidiary with a 
corresponding credit in the equity.
 
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reﬂected as 
additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings 
per share. 
16.  Investment in Subsidiaries
 
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Company has 
control. The Company controls an entity when the company 
is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its 
involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those 
returns through its power to direct the relevant activities of the 
entity.
 
Investment in subsidiaries are measured at cost less 
accumulated impairment, if any.

Signiﬁcant estimates- actuarial assumptions and sensitivity 
The signiﬁcant actuarial assumptions were as follows:
Sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation to changes in the weighted principal assumptions is:
Date of valuation
 Change in assumption
March 31, 2024
March 31, 2023
Discount rate
+/- 1.00%
+/- 1.00%
Salary growth rate
+/- 1.00%
+/- 1.00%
Withdrawal rate
+/- 1.00%
+/- 1.00%
The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, this is 
unlikely to occur,  and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the deﬁned beneﬁt 
obligation to signiﬁcant actuarial assumptions the same method (present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation calculated with the 
projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied as when calculating the deﬁned beneﬁt liability 
recognised in the balance sheet.
The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared to the prior period.

Risk Exposure
Through its deﬁned beneﬁt plans, the Company is exposed to a number of risks, the most signiﬁcant of which are detailed-
Investment risk
The present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt plan liability is calculated using a discount rate which is determined by 
reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds. If the return on plan asset 
is below this rate, it will create a plan deﬁcit. Currently, for the plan in India, it has a relatively balanced mix of 
investments in government securities, and other debt instruments.
Interest risk
A fall in the discount rate which is linked to the G.Sec. Rate will increase the present value of the liability requiring 
higher provision. A fall in the discount rate generally increases the mark to market value of the assets depending 
on the duration of asset.
Asset liability 
matching risk
The plan faces the ALM risk as to the matching cash ﬂow. Since the plan is invested in lines of Rule 101 of Income 
Tax Rules, 1962, this generally reduces ALM risk
Moratility risk
Since the beneﬁts under the plan is not payable for life time and payable till retirement age only, plan does not have 
any longevity risk.  
 
 
Concentration 
risk
Plan is having a concentration risk as all the assets are invested with the insurance entity and a default will wipe out 
all the assets. Although probability of this is very less as insurance companies have to follow regulatory guidelines.
Salary risk
The present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of members. 
As such, an increase in the salary of the members more than assumed level will increase the plan’s liability.
Maturity proﬁle of gratuity liability and Employer contribution
Expected contributions to post-employment beneﬁt plans for the year ending 31 March 2024 are Rs. Nil/- (as at March 31, 2023: Rs. Nil).
The weighted average duration (based on discounted cash ﬂows) of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation is 8 years (8 years 2022-23). The 
expected maturity analysis of undiscounted gratuity is as follows:

Credit Risk
Credit risk is the risk that counterparty will not meet its obligations under a ﬁnancial instrument or customer contract, leading to a 
ﬁnancial loss. The Company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade receivables) and from its ﬁnancing 
activities, including Fixed deposits with banks and ﬁnancial institutions and other ﬁnancial instruments.
Financial instruments and cash deposits
Credit risk from balances with banks and ﬁnancial institutions is managed by the Company’s ﬁnance department in accordance with 
the Company’s policy. Investments of surplus funds are made generally in the ﬁxed deposits and for funding to subsidiary company. 
The investment limits are set to minimise the concentration of risks and therefore mitigate ﬁnancial loss to make payments for vendors.
The Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk for the components of the balance sheet at March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 is the 
carrying amounts as stated in balance sheet except for balances of subsidiary company. 
Liquidity Risk
The Company monitors its risk of a shortage of funds using a liquidity planning tool.
The Company’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and ﬂexibility through the use of bank loans and 
unsecured loans. The Company has access to a sufﬁcient variety of sources of funding which can be rolled over with existing lenders. 
The Company believes that the working capital is sufﬁcient to meet its current requirements.

Opinion 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated ﬁnancial 
statements of Choice International Limited (hereinafter referred 
to as the “Holding Company”), its subsidiaries ( Holding Company 
and its subsidiaries together referred to as “the Group”), and its 
jointly controlled operations, which comprise the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2024, and the Consolidated 
Statement of Proﬁt and Loss (including Other Comprehensive 
Income), the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity and the 
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended, 
and notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, including 
material accounting policy information and other explanatory 
information (hereinafter referred to as the “consolidated ﬁnancial 
statements”). 
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according 
to the explanations given to us, and based on consideration of 
reports of other auditors on separate ﬁnancial statements and 
on the other ﬁnancial information of subsidiaries, and jointly 
controlled operations, referred to in the Other Matters section 
below, the aforesaid consolidated ﬁnancial statements give  the 
information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) in the 
manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity 
with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 
133 of the Act read with Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 
Rules, 2015, as amended (“Ind AS”) and other accounting principles 
generally accepted in India, of their consolidated state of affairs 
of the Group and its jointly controlled operations as at March 
31, 2024, and their consolidated proﬁt and other comprehensive 
income, consolidated changes in equity and its consolidated cash 
ﬂows for the year then ended. 
Basis for Opinion 
We conducted our audit of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements 
in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs), as speciﬁed 
under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those 
SAs are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the 
Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our 
report. We are independent of the Group, and its jointly controlled 
operations in accordance with the ethical requirements that are 
relevant to our audit of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements 
in terms of the Code of Ethics issued by Institute of Chartered 
Accountant of India (“ICAI”), and the relevant provisions of the 
Act and we have fulﬁlled our other ethical responsibilities in 
accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit 
evidence we have obtained and on consideration of audit reports 
of other auditors referred to in paragraph (a) and (b) of the “Other 
Matters” section below, is sufﬁcient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our opinion. 
Key Audit Matters 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most signiﬁcance in our audit of the 
consolidated ﬁnancial statements for the year ended March 31, 
2024. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of 
the consolidated ﬁnancial statements as a whole, and in forming 
our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion 
on these matters.  
We have determined that there are no key audit matters to 
communicate in our report.
Information Other than the Consolidated Financial Statements 
and Auditor’s Report Thereon
The Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the 
other information. The other information comprises the Annual 
Report  but does not include the consolidated ﬁnancial statements 
and our auditor’s report thereon. The Annual Report is expected 
to be made available to us after the date of this auditor’s report.
Our opinion on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements does not 
cover the other information and we will not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the consolidated ﬁnancial 
statements, our responsibility is to read the other information 
identiﬁed above when it becomes available and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent 
with the consolidated ﬁnancial statements or our knowledge 
obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially 
misstated. When we read the Annual Report, if we conclude 
that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required 
to communicate the matter to those charged with governance 
under SA 720 ‘The Auditor’s responsibilities Relating to Other 
Information.
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with 
Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements
The Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the 
preparation and presentation of these consolidated ﬁnancial 
statements in term of the requirements of the Act that give 
a true and fair view of the consolidated ﬁnancial position, 
consolidated ﬁnancial performance, consolidated changes in 
equity and consolidated cash ﬂows of the Group including its 
Jointly controlled operations in accordance with the accounting 
principles generally accepted in India, including the Accounting 
Standards speciﬁed under section 133 of the Act. The respective 
Management and Board of Directors of the companies included 
in the Group and of its jointly controlled operations are responsible 
for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance 
with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of 
the Group and of its jointly controlled operations for preventing 
and detecting frauds and other irregularities; the selection and 
application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments 
and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, 
implementation and maintenance of adequate internal ﬁnancial 
controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring accuracy 
and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the 
preparation and presentation of the consolidated ﬁnancial 
statements that give a true and fair view and are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have 
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT 
To the Members of Choice International Limited 
Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements 
been used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated 
ﬁnancial statements by the Management and Board of Directors 
of the Holding Company, as aforesaid. 
In preparing the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, the respective 
Management and Board of Directors of the companies 
included in the Group and of its jointly controlled operations are 
responsible for assessing the ability of the Group and of its jointly 
controlled operations to continue as a going concern, disclosing, 
as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the 
going concern basis of accounting unless the  Management 
either intends to liquidate their respective companies or to cease 
operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. 
The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in 
the Group and of its jointly controlled operations are responsible 
for overseeing the ﬁnancial reporting process of the Group and of 
its jointly controlled operations. 
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the consolidated ﬁnancial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to 
issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that 
an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing 
(“SAs”) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered 
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably 
be expected to inﬂuence the economic decisions of users taken 
on the basis of these consolidated ﬁnancial statements. 
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:
• 
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the 
consolidated ﬁnancial statements, whether due to fraud or 
error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to 
those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufﬁcient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of 
not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is 
higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve 
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or 
the override of internal control. 
• 
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the 
audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate 
in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are 
also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the 
Holding Company has adequate internal ﬁnancial controls 
with reference to consolidated ﬁnancial statements in place 
and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
• 
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used 
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related 
disclosures made by the management and Board of Directors.
• 
Conclude on the appropriateness of the management’s 
and Board of Director’s use of the going concern basis of 
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, 
whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or 
conditions that may cast signiﬁcant doubt on the ability of 
the Group and its jointly controlled operations to continue as 
a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty 
exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s 
report to the related disclosures in the consolidated ﬁnancial 
statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify 
our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence 
obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, 
future events or conditions may cause the Group and jointly 
controlled operations to cease to continue as a going concern.

[Referred to in paragraph 1(g) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ in the Independent Auditors’ Report of even 
date to the Members of Choice International Limited on the consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2024] 
Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)
Opinion
In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated ﬁnancial 
statements of the Company as of and for the year ended March 
31, 2024, we have audited the internal ﬁnancial controls reference 
to consolidated ﬁnancial statements of Choice International 
Limited (hereinafter referred to as “the Holding Company”), its 
subsidiary companies (the Holding Company and its subsidiaries 
together referred to as “the Group”) and its jointly controlled 
operations, which are incorporated in India, as of that date. 
In our opinion, and to the best of our information and according 
to the explanations given to us, the Holding Company, its 
subsidiary companies, and jointly controlled companies, which 
are companies incorporated in India, have, in all material 
respects, an adequate internal ﬁnancial controls with reference 
to consolidated ﬁnancial statements and such internal ﬁnancial 
controls with reference to consolidated ﬁnancial statements 
were operating effectively as at March 31, 2024, based on the 
internal ﬁnancial controls with reference to consolidated ﬁnancial 
statements criteria established by the respective companies 
considering the essential components of internal control stated 
in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls 
Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India (“the ICAI”).
Management and Board of Director’s Responsibility for 
Internal Financial Controls
The respective Management and the Board of Directors of 
the Holding Company, its subsidiary companies and its jointly 
controlled operations, which are companies incorporated in 
India, are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal 
ﬁnancial controls based on the internal control with reference 
to consolidated ﬁnancial statements criteria established by the 
respective companies considering the essential components of 
internal control stated in the Guidance Note. These responsibilities 
include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate 
internal ﬁnancial controls that were operating effectively for 
ensuring the orderly and efﬁcient conduct of its business, including 
adherence to the respective company’s policies, the safeguarding 
of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, 
the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and 
the timely preparation of reliable ﬁnancial information, as required 
under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal ﬁnancial 
controls with reference to consolidated ﬁnancial statements of 
the Holding Company, its subsidiary companies and its jointly 
controlled operations, which are companies incorporated in India, 
based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with 
the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over 
Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) issued by the ICAI and 
the Standards on Auditing prescribed under section 143(10) of 
the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal ﬁnancial 
controls. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that 
we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the 
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate 
internal ﬁnancial controls with reference to consolidated ﬁnancial 
statements was established and maintained and if such controls 
operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal ﬁnancial controls 
with reference to consolidated ﬁnancial statements and their 
operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal ﬁnancial controls 
with reference to consolidated ﬁnancial statements included 
obtaining an understanding of internal ﬁnancial controls with 
reference to consolidated ﬁnancial statements, assessing the 
risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating 
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based 
on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the 
auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of 
material misstatement of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, 
whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the 
audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms of their 
reports referred to in the Other Matter paragraph below, is 
sufﬁcient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion 
on the internal ﬁnancial controls with reference to consolidated 
ﬁnancial statements of the Holding Company, its subsidiary 
companies, and its jointly controlled operations, which are 
companies incorporated in India.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls With Reference to 
Consolidated Financial Statements
A company’s internal ﬁnancial control with reference to 
consolidated ﬁnancial statements is a process designed to 
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of 
ﬁnancial reporting and the preparation of consolidated ﬁnancial 
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal ﬁnancial 
control with reference to consolidated ﬁnancial statements 
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the 
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and 
fairly reﬂect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the 
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are 
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated 
ﬁnancial statements in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the 
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations 
of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide 
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection 
of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s 
assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated 
ﬁnancial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls With 
Reference to Consolidated Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal ﬁnancial controls 
with reference to consolidated ﬁnancial statements, including 
the possibility of collusion or improper management override of 
controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur 
and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the 
internal ﬁnancial controls with reference to consolidated ﬁnancial 
statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the 
internal ﬁnancial control with reference to consolidated ﬁnancial 
statements may become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or 
procedures may deteriorate.
Other Matter
Our aforesaid report under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on the 
adequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal ﬁnancial 
controls with reference to consolidated ﬁnancial statements in so 
far as it relates to 12 subsidiary companies and 4 jointly controlled 
companies, which are companies incorporated in India, is based 
on the corresponding reports of the auditors of the branches and 
the auditors of such companies incorporated in India. Our opinion 
is not modiﬁed in respect of this matter.

v.  Principle of Consolidation and equity accounting 
 
Subsidiaries- 
 
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements have comprised 
ﬁnancial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, 
subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over 
which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity 
when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns 
from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to 
affect those returns through its power to direct the relevant 
activities of the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from 
the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are 
deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. 
 
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for 
business combinations by the Group.
 
The Group combines the ﬁnancial statements of the Holding 
Company and its subsidiaries line by line adding together 
Notes To The Consolidated Financial Statements  for the year ended on March 31,2024 (continued..)
like items of assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses. 
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealized gains on 
transactions within the Group are eliminated. Unrealized losses 
are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence 
of an impairment of the transferred asset. Accounting policies 
of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to 
ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
 
Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of subsidiaries 
are shown separately in the consolidated statement of proﬁt 
or loss, consolidated statement of changes in equity and 
balance sheet respectively. Statement of Proﬁt and Loss 
including Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) is attributable 
to the equity holders of the Holding Company and to the non-
controlling interest basis the respective ownership interest 
and such balance is attributed even if this results in controlling 
interest is having a deﬁcit balance.
 
Associates-
 
Associates are all entities over which the Group has signiﬁcant 
inﬂuence but not control or joint control. This is generally the 
case where the Group holds between 20% and 50% of the 
voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for 
using the equity method of accounting (see (iii) below), after 
initially being recognized at cost.
 
Equity Method-
 
Under the equity method of accounting, the investments 
are initially recognized at cost and adjusted thereafter to 
recognize the Group’s share of the post-acquisition proﬁts or 
losses of the investee in proﬁt or loss, and the Group’s share 
of other comprehensive income of the investee in other 
comprehensive income. Dividends received or receivable from 
associates and joint ventures are recognized as a reduction in 
the carrying amount of the investment.
 
When the Group’s share of losses in an equity-accounted 
investment equals or exceeds its interest in the entity, including 
any other unsecured long-term receivables, the Group does 
not recognize further losses, unless it has incurred obligations 
or made payments on behalf of the other entity.
 
Unrealized gains on transactions between the Group and 
its associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent 
of the Group’s interest in these entities. Unrealized losses are 
also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of 
an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies 
of equity accounted investees have been changed where 
necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by 
the Group.
 
Changes in ownership interests
 
The Group treats transactions with non-controlling interests 
that do not result in a loss of control as transactions with 
equity owners of the Group. A change in ownership interest 
results in an adjustment between the carrying amounts of 
the controlling and non-controlling interests to reﬂect their 
relative interests in the subsidiary. Any difference between the 
amount of the adjustment to non-controlling interests and any 
consideration paid or received is recognized within equity.
 
When the Group ceases to consolidate or equity account 
for an investment because of a loss of control, joint control 
or signiﬁcant inﬂuence, any retained interest in the entity 
is re-measured to its fair value with the change in carrying 
amount recognized in proﬁt or loss. This fair value becomes 
the initial carrying -amount for the purposes of subsequently 
accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint 
venture or ﬁnancial asset. In addition, any amounts previously 
recognized in other comprehensive income in respect of that 
entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed 
of the related assets or liabilities. This may mean that amounts 
previously recognized in other comprehensive income are 
reclassiﬁed to proﬁt or loss.
 
If the ownership interest in an associate is reduced but joint 
control or signiﬁcant inﬂuence is retained, only a proportionate 
share of the amounts previously recognized in other 
comprehensive income are reclassiﬁed to proﬁt or loss where 
appropriate.
vi. Fair value measurement
 
Fair value is the price that would be received on sale of an 
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the measurement date in the 
principal or, in its absence, the most advantageous market to 
which the Group has access at that date. 
 
The best estimate of the fair value of a ﬁnancial instrument on 
initial recognition is normally the transaction price. If the Group 
determines that the fair value on initial recognition differs 
from the transaction price and the fair value is evidenced 
neither by a quoted price in an active market for an identical 
asset or liability nor based on a valuation technique that 
uses only data from observable markets, then the ﬁnancial 
instrument is initially measured at fair value, adjusted to defer 
the difference between the fair value on initial recognition 
and the transaction price. Subsequently that difference is 
recognised in Statement of Proﬁt and Loss on an appropriate 
basis over the life of the instrument but no later than when the 
valuation is wholly supported by observable market data or 
the transaction is closed out. 
 
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured 
or disclosed in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements are 
categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as 
follows, based on the lowest level input that is signiﬁcant to 
the fair value measurement as a whole:
•  Level 1 - Valuation using quoted market price in active 
markets: The fair value for ﬁnancial instruments traded 
in active markets at the reporting date is based on their 
quoted market price, without any deduction for transaction 
costs. A market is regarded as active, if transactions for 
the asset or liability take place with sufﬁcient frequency 
and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing 
basis.
•  Level 2 - Valuation using observable inputs: If there is no 
quoted price in an active market, then the Company uses 
valuation techniques that maximise the use of relevant

Notice
Statutory Reports
observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable 
inputs. The chosen valuation technique incorporates most 
of the factors that market participants would take into 
account in pricing a transaction.
•  Level 3 - Valuation with signiﬁcant unobservable inputs: 
The valuation techniques are used only when fair value 
cannot be determined by using observable inputs. The 
Company regularly reviews signiﬁcant unobservable 
inputs and valuation adjustments. Level 3 assets are 
typically very illiquid, and fair values can only be calculated 
using estimates. 
The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate 
in the circumstances and for which sufﬁcient data are 
available to measure fair value, maximising the use of 
relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of 
unobservable inputs. 
vii.  Use of judgment and Estimates 
 
The preparation of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements 
requires the management to make judgments, estimates 
and assumptions in the application of accounting policies 
that affects the reported amount of assets, liabilities and the 
accompanying disclosures along with contingent liabilities as 
at the date of consolidated ﬁnancial statements and revenue 
& expenses for the reporting period. Although these estimates 
are based on the management’s best knowledge of current 
events and actions, uncertainty about these assumptions 
and estimates could result in outcomes different from the 
estimates. Difference between actual results and estimates 
are recognised in the year in which the results are known or 
materialise i.e. prospectively.
 Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and 
are based on historical experience and other factors, 
including expectations of future events that are believed 
to be reasonable under the circumstances. The key areas 
involving estimation uncertainty, higher degree of judgement 
or complexity, or areas where assumptions are signiﬁcant to 
the consolidated ﬁnancial statements include:
i)  Impairment of ﬁnancial assets
ii) Estimation of fair value measurement of ﬁnancial assets 
and liabilities 
iii) Effective interest rate
iv) Business model assessment
v) Provisions and Contingencies
vi) Useful life and expected residual value of assets
vii) Tax position for current tax and recognition of deferred tax 
assets/liabilities
viii) Measurement of Deﬁned Beneﬁt Obligations and actuarial 
assumptions
ix) Classiﬁcation of lease and related discount rate
x) Share Based Payments
xi) Measurement of Expected Credit Loss allowance for 
Trade receivables
Further an entity is consolidated as a subsidiary if the Company 
has control over the said entity based on the management 
evaluation of investments and related agreements/ deeds 
and determines that the Group has control over the said entity 
in terms of Ind AS-110 on Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Control shall include the right to appoint majority of the directors 
or to control the management or policy decisions exercisable 
by a person or persons acting individually or in concert, 
directly or indirectly, including by virtue of their shareholding 
or management rights or shareholders’ agreements or voting 
agreements or in any other manner.
B. Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies
1. Current versus non-current classiﬁcation
 The Group presents assets and liabilities in the balance sheet 
based on current /non-current classiﬁcation.
An asset is treated as current when it is:
• Expected to be realized or intended to be sold or consumed in 
normal operating cycle.
• Held primarily for the purpose of trading
• Expected to be realized within twelve months after the 
reporting date, or
• Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged 
or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the 
reporting period
All other assets are classiﬁed as non-current.
A liability is current when:
• It is expected to be settled in normal operating cycle
• It is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting 
period, or
• There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the 
liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period
All other liabilities are classiﬁed as non–current.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classiﬁed as non-current 
assets and liabilities. 
Based on the nature of products and services offered by the 
Group, operating cycle determined is 12 months for the purpose 
of current and non-current classiﬁcation of assets and liabilities.
The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition of assets 
for processing and their realisation in cash and cash equivalents.
2. Revenue recognition
 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration 
received or receivable. Revenue is reduced for estimated 
customer returns, rebates and other similar allowances.
    Sale of services
 
The Group recognizes revenue on accrual basis when the 
signiﬁcant terms of the arrangement are enforceable, services 
have been delivered and the collectability is reasonably 
assured. The method of recognizing the revenues and costs 
depends on the nature of the services rendered. Revenue is 
recognized when no signiﬁcant uncertainty exists as to its 
realization or collection.
 
Interest Income
 
Interest income from ﬁnancial assets is recognized when it 
is probable that economic beneﬁts will ﬂow to the Group 
and the amount of income can be measured reliably. Interest 
income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal 
outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, 
which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash 
receipts through the expected life of the ﬁnancial assets to 
that asset’s net carrying amount on initial recognition.
 
Income from sale of investment
 
Gains or losses on the sale of investments are recognised 
in Statement of proﬁt and loss on trade date basis as the 
difference between fair value of the consideration received 
and carrying amount of the investment securities.
 
Dividend Income
 
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the 
shareholder’s right to receive payment has been established 
(provided that it is probable that the economic beneﬁts 
will ﬂow to the Group and the amount of income can be 
measured reliably).
 
Brokerage Income
 
Brokerage income in relation to stock broking activity is 
recognised on trade date basis.
3.  Property, Plant and Equipment
 
Land and buildings held for use in the production or supply of 
goods or services, or for administrative purposes, are stated 
in the balance sheet at cost less accumulated depreciation 
and accumulated impairment losses. Freehold land is not 
depreciated.
 
All items of property, plant and equipment are initially 
recorded at cost. Such cost includes the cost of replaced part 
of the property, plant and equipment and borrowing costs 
that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or 
production of a qualifying property, plant and equipment. The 
cost of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognized 
as an asset if, and only if, it is probable that future economic 
beneﬁts associated with the item will ﬂow to the group and 
the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
 
Properties in the course of construction for production, 
supply or administrative purposes are carried at cost, less 
any recognized impairment loss. Cost includes professional 
fees and, for qualifying assets, borrowing costs capitalized 
in accordance with the Group`s accounting policy. Such 
properties are classiﬁed to the appropriate categories of 
property, plant and equipment when completed and ready 
for intended use. Depreciation of these assets, on the same 
basis as other property assets, commences when the assets 
are ready for their intended use.
 
All items of property, plant and equipment having cost more 
than Rs. 5000/- are recognized as an asset.
 
Subsequent to recognition, property, plant and equipment 
(excluding freehold land) are measured at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment 
losses. When signiﬁcant parts of property, plant and 
equipment are required to be replaced in intervals, the group 
recognizes such parts as individual assets with speciﬁc useful 
lives and depreciation respectively. Likewise, when a major 
inspection is performed, its cost is recognized in the carrying 
amount of the plant and equipment as a replacement cost 
only if the recognition criteria are satisﬁed. All other repair and 
maintenance costs are recognized in the Statement of Proﬁt 
and Loss as incurred.
 
Assets held under ﬁnance leases are depreciated over 
their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned 
assets. However, when there is no reasonable certainty that 
ownership will be obtained by the end of the lease term, 
assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and 
useful lives.
 
Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost of assets 
less their residual values over the useful lives as prescribed in 
Schedule II of to the Companies Act, 2013, using the straight- 
line method (“SLM”). Residual value is considered nil case of 
Computers, Server and network and 5% is considered in case 
of other assets.

Corporate Overview
Financial Statements
Notice
Statutory Reports
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed 
for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
The residual values, useful life and depreciation method are 
reviewed at each ﬁnancial year-end to ensure that the amount, 
method and period of depreciation are consistent with previous 
estimates and the expected pattern of consumption of the future 
economic beneﬁts embodied in the items of property, plant and 
equipment.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon 
disposal or when no future economic beneﬁts are expected 
to arise from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss 
arising on disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant 
and equipment is determined as the difference between sale 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised 
in proﬁt or loss.
4.  Investment Properties-
 
Investment properties are properties that is held for long-term 
rentals yields or for capital appreciation (including property 
under construction for such purposes) or both, and that is not 
occupied by the Group, is classiﬁed as investment property. 
Investment properties are measured initially at cost, including 
transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment 
properties are stated at cost less accumulated impairment 
loss, if any. Though the Group measures investment property 
using cost based measurement, the fair value of investment 
property is disclosed in the notes. Fair values are determined 
based on an annual evaluation performed by an accredited 
external independent valuer. Investment properties are 
derecognised either when they have been disposed of or 
when they are permanently withdrawn from use and no 
future economic beneﬁt is expected from their disposal. 
The difference between the net disposal proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset is recognised in proﬁt or loss in 
the period of derecognition.
5.  Intangible Assets
 
Intangible asset including intangible assets under development 
are stated at cost, net of accumulated amortisation and 
accumulated impairment losses, if any. Intangible assets 
acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at 
cost. The amortization period and the amortisation method 
are reviewed at the end of each ﬁnancial year. The useful lives 
of intangible assets are assessed as either ﬁnite or indeﬁnite. 
Intangible assets with ﬁnite lives are amortised over the useful 
economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there 
is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. 
The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an 
intangible asset with a ﬁnite useful life are reviewed at least 
at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the expected 
useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future 
economic beneﬁts embodied in the asset are considered to 
modify the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, 
and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The 
amortisation expense on intangible assets with inﬁnite lives 
is recognised in the statement of proﬁt and loss unless such 
expenditure forms part of carrying value of another asset.
6. Segment Reporting 
 
The Group operates operations predominately relates to four 
business segment i.e. Broking & Distribution services, Advisory 
services and NBFC services Business segments have been 
identiﬁed as separate reportable segments as per Ind-AS 108.
7. Functional Currency
 
The group`s consolidated ﬁnancial statements are presented 
in INR (rounded off to lakhs), which is also the group’s functional 
currency.
 
Transaction and balances
 
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the 
Group in their functional currency spot rates at the date the 
transaction ﬁrst qualiﬁes for recognition.
 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are translated at the functional currency spot rates 
of exchange at the reporting period.
 
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary 
items or on translating monetary items are recognized in the 
statement of proﬁt or loss except.
•  exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings 
relating to assets under construction for future productive 
use, which are included in the cost of those assets when 
they are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs on 
those foreign currency borrowings;
•  exchange differences on transactions entered into in order 
to hedge certain foreign currency risks
•  exchange differences on monetary items receivable from 
or payable to a foreign operation for which settlement 
is neither planned nor likely to occur (therefore forming 
part of the net investment in foreign operation), which are 
recognised initially in other comprehensive income and 
reclassiﬁed from equity to proﬁt or loss on repayment of 
the monetary items.
 
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical 
cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange 
rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary 
items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are 
translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair 
value was determined. The gain or loss arising on translation 
of non-monetary items measured at fair value is treated in 
line with the recognition of the gain or loss on the change 
in fair value of the item (i.e. translation differences on items 
whose fair value gain or loss is recognised in OCI or proﬁt or 
loss are also recognised in OCI or proﬁt or loss, respectively).
8.  Income Tax
     Current taxes
 
Income tax expense is recognized in net proﬁt in the statement 
of proﬁt and loss except to the extent that it relates to items 
recognized directly in other comprehensive income or equity, 
in which case it is recognized in other comprehensive income 
or equity respectively. Current income tax is recognized at the 
amount expected to be paid to or recovered from the tax 
authorities, using the tax rates and tax laws that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
The Group offsets, on a year to year basis, the current tax 
assets and liabilities, where it has legally enforceable right to 
do so and where it intends to settle such assets and liabilities 
on a net basis.
 
Deferred taxes
 
Deferred tax is recognized on differences between the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated 
ﬁnancial statements and the corresponding tax bases used 
in the computation of taxable proﬁt and are accounted 
for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax 
liabilities are generally recognized for all taxable temporary 
differences, and deferred tax assets are generally recognized 
for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is 
probable that taxable proﬁts will be available against which 
those deductible temporary differences can be utilized. Such 
assets and liabilities are not recognized if the temporary 
difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition 
(other than in a business combination) of other assets and 
liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable proﬁt 
nor the accounting proﬁt. 
 
Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside the proﬁt 
and loss is recognised outside proﬁt and loss (either in other 
comprehensive income or in equity).
 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at 
each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it 
is no longer probable that sufﬁcient taxable proﬁts will be 
available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a 
legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes 
levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends 
to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
9. Impairment of Non-Financial Assets
 
At the end of each reporting period, the Group reviews the 
carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to 
determine whether there is any indication that those assets 
have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, 
the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order 
to determine the extent of impairment loss (if any). When 
it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an 
individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount 
of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. 
When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can 
be identiﬁed, corporate assets are also allocated to individual 
cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to 
the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a 
reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identiﬁed.
 
Intangible assets with indeﬁnite useful lives and intangible 
assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment at 
least annually, and whenever there is an indication that the 
asset may be impaired.
 
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs 
of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the 
estimated future cash ﬂows are discounted to their present 
value using a pre-tax discount rate that reﬂects current 
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
speciﬁc to the asset for which the estimates of future cash 
ﬂows have not been adjusted. 
 
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) 
is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying 
amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its 
recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognized in the 
proﬁt or loss.
 
When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying 
amount of the asset ( or a cash-generating unit) is increased 
to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that 
the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying 
amount that would have been determined had no impairment 
loss been recognised for the asset ( or cash-generating unit) 
in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised 
immediately in proﬁt or loss.
10.  Financial Instruments
 
A ﬁnancial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a 
ﬁnancial asset of one entity and a ﬁnancial liability or equity 
instrument of another entity. 
 
Financial Assets
a) Initial recognition and measurement
  All ﬁnancial assets are recognised initially at fair value 
plus, in the case of ﬁnancial assets not recorded at fair 
value through proﬁt or loss, transaction costs that are 
attributable to the acquisition of the ﬁnancial asset. 
Purchases or sales of ﬁnancial assets that require delivery 
of assets within a time frame established by regulation or 
convention in the market place (regular way trades) are 
recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Group 
commits to purchase or sell the asset.
  On initial recognition, a ﬁnancial asset is measured at:
•  Amortised cost
•  Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income – 
debt instruments
•  Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income – 
equity instruments
•  Fair Value Through Proﬁt and Loss
 
Amortised cost - The Group’s business model is not assessed 
on an instrument-by-instrument basis, but at a higher level 
of aggregated portfolios being the level at which they are 
managed. The ﬁnancial asset is held with the objective to 
hold ﬁnancial asset in order to collect contractual cash ﬂows

Notice
Statutory Reports
as per the contractual terms that give rise on speciﬁed dates 
to cash ﬂows that are solely payment of principal and interest 
(SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding. Accordingly, the 
Group measures Bank balances, Loans, Trade receivables 
and other ﬁnancial instruments at amortised cost.
 
FVOCI - debt instruments - The Group measures its debt 
instruments at FVOCI when the instrument is held within a 
business model, the objective of which is achieved by both 
collecting contractual cash ﬂows and selling ﬁnancial assets; 
and the contractual terms of the ﬁnancial asset meet the SPPI 
test.
 
FVOCI - equity instruments - The Group subsequently 
measures all equity investments at fair value through proﬁt or 
loss, unless the Group’s management has elected to classify 
irrevocably some of its equity instruments at FVOCI, when 
such instruments meet the deﬁnition of Equity under Ind AS 32 
Financial Instruments and are not held for trading.
 
Financial assets are not reclassiﬁed subsequent to their initial 
recognition, except if and in the period the Group changes its 
business model for managing ﬁnancial assets.
 
All ﬁnancial assets not classiﬁed as measured at amortised 
cost or FVOCI are measured at FVTPL. This includes all 
derivative ﬁnancial assets.
b) Subsequent measurement
 
Equity instruments
 
All equity investments in scope of Ind AS 109 are measured 
at fair value. Equity instruments which are held for trading 
are classiﬁed as at FVTPL. For all other equity instruments, 
the Group may make an irrevocable election to present 
subsequent changes in the fair value in OCI. The Group makes 
such election on an instrument-by-instrument basis. The 
classiﬁcation is made on initial recognition and is irrevocable. 
 
Dividends from such investments are recognized in proﬁt or 
loss as other income. There is no recycling of the amounts 
from OCI to Proﬁt and Loss, even on sale of investment. 
However, the Group may transfer the cumulative gain or loss 
within equity. 
 
Equity instruments subsequently measured at fair value 
through proﬁt or loss are measured at fair value with all 
changes recognized in the statement of proﬁt and loss.
c) De-recognition
 
A ﬁnancial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a ﬁnancial 
asset or part of a group of similar ﬁnancial assets) is primarily 
derecognised (i.e. removed from the group’s balance sheet) 
when:
 
The rights to receive cash ﬂows from the asset have expired, 
or
 
The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash ﬂows from 
the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received 
cash ﬂows in full without material delay to a third party 
under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement and either (a) the Group 
has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the 
asset, or (b) the Group has neither transferred nor retained 
substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has 
transferred control of the asset
 
When the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash 
ﬂows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through 
arrangement, it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained 
the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has neither 
transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and 
rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the 
group continues to recognised the transferred asset to the 
extent of the group`s  continuing involvement. In that case, the 
group also recognises an associated liability. The transferred 
asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis 
that reﬂects the rights and obligations that the group has 
retained.
 
Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee 
over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the 
original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum 
amount of consideration that the group could be required to 
repay.
d) Impairment of ﬁnancial assets
 
The Group recognises impairment loss applying the expected 
credit loss (ECL) model on the ﬁnancial assets measured 
at amortised cost, debt instruments at FVTOCI, lease 
receivables, trade receivables, and other contractual right to 
receive cash or other ﬁnancial asset and ﬁnancial guarantee 
not designated as at FVTPL. 
 
Expected credit losses are the weighted average of credit 
losses with the respective risks of default occurring as the 
weights. 
 
The Group measures the loss allowance for a ﬁnancial 
instrument at an amount equal to the lifetime expected 
credit losses if the credit risk on that ﬁnancial instrument has 
increased signiﬁcantly since initial recognition. If the credit risk 
on a ﬁnancial instrument has not increased signiﬁcantly since 
initial recognition, the Group measures the loss allowance for 
that ﬁnancial instrument at an amount equal to 12 months 
expected credit losses.
 
For trade receivables or any contractual right to receive cash 
or other ﬁnancial assets that result from transactions that are 
within the scope of Ind AS 115, the Group always measures the 
loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit 
losses.
 
Further, for the purpose of measuring lifetime expected 
credit loss allowance for trade receivables, the Group applies 
‘simpliﬁed approach’ permitted by Ind AS 109 Financial 
Instruments. This expected credit loss allowance is computed 
based on a provision matrix which takes into account 
historical credit loss experience and adjusted for forward-
looking information.
 
Write offs – The gross carrying amount of a ﬁnancial asset 
is written-off (either partially or in full) to the extent that there 
is no reasonable expectation of recovering the asset in its 
entirety or a portion thereof. This is generally the case when 
the Group determines that the vendor does not have assets 
or sources of income that could generate sufﬁcient cash ﬂows 
to repay the amounts subject to the write-off and when there 
is no reasonable expectation of recovery from the collaterals 
held. However, ﬁnancial assets that are written-off could still 
be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with 
the Group’s procedures for recovery of amounts due.
 
Presentation of allowance for ECL in the Balance Sheet – 
Loss allowances for ECL are deducted from the gross carrying 
amount of ﬁnancial assets measured at amortised cost.
 
For loan given measured at amortised cost or FVTOCI, except 
for investments in equity instruments. Group follows a ‘three-
stage’ model for impairment based on changes in credit 
quality since initial recognition.
 
Stage 1 (Performing Assets) – includes ﬁnancial assets 
that have not had a signiﬁcant increase in credit risk since 
initial recognition or that have low credit risk at the reporting 
date. For these assets, 12-month ECL is recognised and 
interest income is calculated on the gross carrying amount 
of the assets (that is, without deduction for credit allowance). 
12-month ECL are the portion of ECL that results from default 
events on a ﬁnancial instrument that are possible within 12 
months after the reporting date, if the credit risk has not 
signiﬁcantly increased since initial recognition. 
 
Stage 2 (Underperforming Assets with signiﬁcant increase 
in credit risk since initial recognition) – includes ﬁnancial 
instruments that have had a signiﬁcant increase in credit risk 
since initial recognition (unless they have low credit risk at the 
reporting date) but that do not have objective evidence of 
impairment. For these assets, lifetime ECL are recognised, but 
interest income is calculated on the gross carrying amount of 
the assets. Lifetime ECL are the expected credit losses that 
result from all possible default events over the expected life of 
the instrument. 
 
Stage 3 (Non-performing or Credit-impaired assets) – 
includes ﬁnancial assets that have objective evidence of 
impairment at the reporting date. For these assets, lifetime 
ECL is recognised and interest income is recognised on Net 
exposure (that is Gross carrying amount less Provision for 
Expected credit losses).
Financial Liabilities
a) Initial recognition and measurement
 
All ﬁnancial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, 
in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of 
directly attributable transaction costs.
b) Subsequent measurement
 
The measurement of ﬁnancial liabilities depends on their 
classiﬁcation, as described below:
 
Financial liabilities at fair value through proﬁt or loss
 
Financial liabilities at fair value through proﬁt or loss include 
ﬁnancial liabilities held for trading and ﬁnancial liabilities 
designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through 
proﬁt or loss. Financial liabilities are classiﬁed as held for 
trading if they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in 
the near term. This category also includes derivative ﬁnancial 
instruments entered into by the group that are not designated 
as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as deﬁned 
by Ind-AS 109. Separated embedded derivatives are also 
classiﬁed as held for trading unless they are designated as 
effective hedging instruments.
 
Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in 
the proﬁt or loss.
 
Financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair 
value through proﬁt or loss are designated at the initial date of 
recognition, and only if the criteria in Ind AS 109 are satisﬁed. 
For liabilities designated as FVTPL, fair value gains/ losses 
attributable to changes in own credit risk is recognized in OCI. 
These gains/ loss are not subsequently transferred to P&L. 
However, the Group may transfer the cumulative gain or loss 
within equity. All other changes in fair value of such liability are 
recognised in the statement of proﬁt or loss. The Group has 
not designated any ﬁnancial liability as at fair value through 
proﬁt and loss.
 
Financial liabilities are subsequently carried at amortized cost 
using the effective interest method, except for contingent 
consideration recognized in a business combination which is 
subsequently measured at fair value through proﬁt and loss. 
For trade and other payables maturing within one year from 
the Balance Sheet date, the carrying amounts approximate 
fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.
 
Derecognition
 
A ﬁnancial liability is derecognised when and only when 
the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled 
or expires. When an existing ﬁnancial liability is replaced 
by another from the same lender on substantially different 
terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially 
modiﬁed, such an exchange or modiﬁcation is treated as the 
derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a 
new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts 
is recognised in the statement of proﬁt or loss
 
Offsetting of ﬁnancial instruments
 
Financial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities are offset and the net 
amount is reported in the balance sheet if there is a currently 
enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and 
there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the 
assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
 
Loans and borrowings
 
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings 
are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest rate method. Gains and losses are recognised 
in proﬁt or loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as 
through the effective interest rate amortisation process.
 
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any 
discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are 
an integral part of the effective interest rate. Such amortisation 
is included as ﬁnance costs in the statement of proﬁt and loss.

Financial guarantee contracts
 
Financial guarantee contracts issued by the group are those 
contracts that require a payment to be made to reimburse 
the holder for a loss it incurs because the speciﬁed debtor 
fails to make a payment when due in accordance with the 
terms of a debt instrument. Financial guarantee contracts 
are recognised initially as a liability at fair value, adjusted for 
transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issuance 
of the guarantee. Subsequently, the liability is measured at 
the higher of the amount of loss allowance determined as 
per impairment requirements of Ind AS 109 and the amount 
recognised less cumulative amortisation.
c) Derecognition
 
A ﬁnancial liability is derecognised when the obligation under 
the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an 
existing ﬁnancial liability is replaced by another from the 
same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms 
of an existing liability are substantially modiﬁed, such an 
exchange or modiﬁcation is treated as the derecognition of 
the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The 
difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in 
the statement of proﬁt or loss
d) Offsetting of ﬁnancial instruments
 
Financial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities are offset and the net 
amount is reported in the balance sheet if there is a currently 
enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and 
there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the 
assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
11. Leases
 
The Group has adopted Ind AS 116 ‘Leases’ with the date of 
initial application being April 1, 2019. The lease asset classes 
primarily consist of leases for Premises. The Group, at the 
inception of a contract, assesses whether the contract is a 
lease or not lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the 
contract conveys the right to control the use of an identiﬁed 
asset for a time in exchange for a consideration. This policy 
has been applied to contracts existing and entered into on or 
after April 1, 2018.
 
The Group evaluates each contract or arrangement, whether 
it qualiﬁes as lease as deﬁned under Ind AS 116.
 
The Group as a lessee
 
The Group as a lessee the Group assesses, whether the 
contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a 
lease if the contract involves– a) the use of an identiﬁed asset, 
b) the right to obtain substantially all the economic beneﬁts 
from use of the identiﬁed asset, and c) the right to direct the 
use of the identiﬁed asset.
 
The Group at the inception of the lease contract recognises 
a Right-of-Use (RoU) asset at cost and a corresponding lease 
liability, for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except 
for leases with term of less than twelve months (short term) 
and low-value assets. Certain lease arrangements includes 
the options to extend or terminate the lease before the end 
of the lease term. ROU assets and lease liabilities includes 
these options when it is reasonably certain that they will be 
exercised.
 
The cost of the ROU assets comprises the amount of the initial 
measurement of the lease liability, any lease payments made 
at or before the inception date of the lease plus any initial 
direct costs, less any lease incentives received. Subsequently, 
the right-of-use assets are measured at cost less any 
accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment 
losses, if any. The ROU assets are depreciated using the 
straight-line method from the commencement date over the 
shorter of lease term or useful life of ROU assets.
 
ROU assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that their 
carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose 
of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the 
higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) 
is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset 
does not generate cash ﬂows that are largely independent 
of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable 
amount is determined for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to 
which the asset belongs.
 
For lease liabilities at inception, the Group measures the lease 
liability at the present value of the lease payments that are 
not paid at that date. The lease payments are discounted 
using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate is readily 
determined, if that rate is not readily determined, the lease 
payments are discounted using the incremental borrowing 
rate.
 
The Group recognises the amount of the re-measurement of 
lease liability as an adjustment to the ROU assets. Where the 
carrying amount of the ROU assets is reduced to zero and 
there is a further reduction in the measurement of the lease 
liability, the Group recognises any remaining amount of the 
remeasurement in the Statement of Proﬁt and Loss.
 
For short-term and low value leases, the Group recognises 
the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-
line basis over the lease term.
 
The Group as a lessor
 
Lease income from operating leases where the Group is a 
lessor is recognised in income on a straight-line basis over the 
lease term unless the receipts are structured to increase in 
line with expected general inﬂation to compensate for the 
expected inﬂationary cost increases. The respective leased 
assets are included in the balance sheet based on their nature.
12. Finance Cost 
 
Finance costs include interest expense computed by applying 
the effective interest rate on respective ﬁnancial instruments 
measured at amortised cost. Financial instruments include 
debt and borrowing, Finance costs are charged to the 
Statement of Proﬁt and Loss. Ancillary and other borrowing 
costs are amortised on straight line basis over the tenure of 
the underlying debt and borrowing.
13. Goods and Service Input Tax Credit
 
Goods and Services tax input credit is accounted for in the 
books in the period in which the supply of goods or service 
received is accounted and when there is no uncertainty in 
availing/utilising the credits.
14. Dividend distribution to equity holders of the Group
 
The Group recognises a liability to make distributions to equity 
holders of the Group when the distribution is authorised and 
the distribution is no longer at the discretion of the Group. As 
per the Act, ﬁnal dividend is authorised when it is approved by 
the shareholders and interim dividend is authorised when it is 
approved by the Board of Directors of the Group.
15. Provisions 
 
Provisions are recognised only when: 
•  an entity has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as 
a result of a past event; and
•  it is probable that an outﬂow of resources embodying 
economic beneﬁts will be required to settle the obligation; 
and
•  a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the 
obligation
 
These are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and adjusted 
to reﬂect the current best estimates.
 
Further, long term provisions are determined by discounting 
the expected future cash ﬂows speciﬁc to the liability. The 
unwinding of the discount is recognised as ﬁnance cost. A 
provision for onerous contracts is measured at the present 
value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the 
contract and the expected net cost of continuing with 
the contract. Before a provision is established, the Group 
recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with 
that contract.
 
Contingent liability is disclosed in case of: 
•  a present obligation arising from past events, when it is 
not probable that an outﬂow of resources will be required 
to settle the obligation; and
•  A present obligation arising from past events, when no 
reliable estimate is possible.
 
Contingent Assets:
 
Contingent assets are not recognised in the consolidated 
ﬁnancial statements
16. Commitments:
 
Commitments are future liabilities for contractual expenditure, 
classiﬁed and disclosed as follows:
•  estimated amount of contracts remaining to be executed 
on capital account and not provided for; 
•  uncalled liability on loan sanctioned and on investments 
partly paid; and 
•  Other non-cancellable commitments, if any, to the extent 
they are considered material and relevant in the opinion 
of management.
17.  Contingent Liabilities
 
A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises 
from past events whose existence will be conﬁrmed by the 
occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain 
future events beyond the control of the Group or a present 
obligation that is not recognized because it is not probable 
that an outﬂow of resources will be required to settle the 
obligation. The Group does not recognize a contingent 
liability but discloses its existence in the consolidated ﬁnancial 
statements. Payments in respect of such liabilities, if any are 
shown as advances.
18.  Earnings Per Share
 
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net 
proﬁt or loss for the year attributable to equity shareholders by 
the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding 
during the year.
 
Diluted earnings per share adjusts the ﬁgures used in the 
determination of basic earnings per share to take into account
•  The after income tax effect of interest and other ﬁnancing 
costs associated with dilutive potential equity shares, and
•  Weighted average number of equity shares that would 
have been outstanding assuming the conversion of all the 
dilutive potential equity.
19. Cash and Cash Equivalents
 
Cash comprises cash on hand and demand deposits with 
banks. Cash equivalents are short-term balances (with an 
original maturity of three months or less from the date of 
acquisition), and highly liquid time deposits that are readily 
convertible into known amounts of cash and which are 
subject to insigniﬁcant risk of changes in value. 
20. Employee Beneﬁts 
 
Short term employee beneﬁts
 
Employee beneﬁts falling due wholly within twelve months of 
rendering the service are classiﬁed as short term employee 
beneﬁts and are expensed in the period in which the 
employee renders the related service. Liabilities recognised in 
respect of short-term employee beneﬁts are measured at the 
undiscounted amount of the beneﬁts expected to be paid in 
exchange for the related service.
 
Long Term employee beneﬁts
 
Group’s net obligation in respect of long-term employee 
beneﬁts is the amount of future beneﬁt that employees 
have earned in return for their service in the current and prior 
periods. Long-term employee beneﬁt primarily consists of 
Leave encashment beneﬁts wherein employees are entitled 
to accumulate leave subject to certain limits for future 
encashment/availment. Long-term compensated absences 
are provided for on the basis of an actuarial valuation at 
the end of each ﬁnancial year using Projected Unit Credit 
(PUC) Method. Actuarial gains/losses, if any, are recognised 
immediately in the Statement of Proﬁt and Loss

Statutory Reports
Post-employment beneﬁts
a) Deﬁned contribution Plans
 
Provident fund: Contributions as required under the statute, 
made to the Provident Fund (Deﬁned Contribution Plan) are 
recognised immediately in the Statement of Proﬁt and Loss. 
There is no obligation other than the monthly contribution 
payable to the Regional Provident Fund Commissioner.
 
ESIC and Labour welfare fund:  The Group’s contribution 
paid/payable during the year to Employee state insurance 
scheme and Labour welfare fund are recognised in the 
Statement of Proﬁt and Loss.
b) Deﬁned beneﬁt Plans
 
Gratuity liability is deﬁned beneﬁt obligation and is provided 
on the basis of an actuarial valuation performed by an 
independent actuary based on projected unit credit method, 
at the end of each ﬁnancial year. 
 
Deﬁned beneﬁt costs are categorised as follows:
i)  Service cost (including current service cost, past service 
cost, as well as gains and losses on curtailments and 
settlements)
ii)  Net interest expense or income
iii)  Re-measurement 
 
Re-measurements of the net deﬁned beneﬁt liability, which 
comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets 
(excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, 
excluding interest), are recognised in OCI, net of taxes. The 
Group determines the net interest expense (income) on the net 
deﬁned beneﬁt liability (asset) for the period by applying the 
discount rate used to measure the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation 
at the beginning of the annual period to the net deﬁned 
beneﬁt liability (asset), taking into account any changes in 
the net deﬁned beneﬁt liability (asset) during the period as 
a result of contributions and beneﬁt payments. Net interest 
expense and other expenses related to deﬁned beneﬁt plans 
are recognised in Statement of Proﬁt and Loss. 
 
The Groups net obligation in respect of gratuity (deﬁned 
beneﬁt plan), is calculated by estimating the amount of future 
beneﬁt that the employees have earned in the current and 
prior periods, discounting that amount and deducting the fair 
value of any plan assets. The retirement beneﬁt obligation 
recognised in the Balance Sheet represents the actual deﬁcit 
or surplus in the Group’s deﬁned beneﬁt plans. Any surplus 
resulting from this calculation is recognised as an asset to the 
extent of present value of any economic beneﬁts available in 
the form of refunds from the plans or reductions in the future 
contribution to the plans.
21.  Share-based Payments 
 
The cost of equity settled transactions is determined by the 
fair value at the grant date. The fair value of the employee 
share options is based on the Black Scholes model.
 
The grant-date fair value of equity-settled share-based 
payment granted to employees is recognized as an expense, 
with a corresponding increase in equity, over the vesting 
period of the awards. The amount recognized as an expense 
is adjusted to reﬂect the number of awards for which the 
related service and non-market performance conditions 
are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately 
recognized is based on the number of awards that meet 
the related service and non-market performance conditions 
at the vesting date. For share-based payment awards with 
market performance conditions and non-vesting conditions, 
the grant-date fair value of the share-based payment is 
measured to reﬂect such conditions and there is no true-up 
for differences between expected and actual outcomes.
 
Choice International Limited grants options to eligible 
employees of the Company under Choice Employee Stock 
Option Scheme 2022. The options vest over a period of four 
years. In case of Group equity-settled share-based payment 
transactions, where the Company grants stock options to the 
employees of its subsidiaries, the transactions are accounted 
by increasing the cost of investment in subsidiary with a 
corresponding credit in the equity.
 
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reﬂected as 
additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings 
per share.
22. Collateral
 
To mitigate its credit risks on ﬁnancial assets, the Group seeks 
to use collateral, where possible. The collateral comes in 
various forms, such as securities, letter of credit/guarantees, 
receivables, inventories, other non-ﬁnancial assets and credit 
enhancements such as netting arrangements.
 
The Group provides fully secured, partially secured and 
unsecured loans to Corporates and individual.
23. Business combinations
 
Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the 
acquisition method as per Ind AS 103 – Business Combinations. 
The consideration transferred in a business combination is 
measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the 
acquisition-date fair values of the assets transferred by the 
Group, liabilities incurred by the Group to the former owners 
of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group 
in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition- related 
costs are generally recognised in Statement of Proﬁt and Loss 
as incurred.
 
At the acquisition date, the identiﬁable assets acquired and 
the liabilities assumed are recognised at their fair value at the 
acquisition date, except that:
 
Deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related 
to employee beneﬁt arrangements are recognised and 
measured in accordance with Ind AS 12 Income Taxes and Ind 
AS 19 Employee Beneﬁts respectively;
 
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the 
consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling 
interests in the acquiree, and the fair value of the acquirer’s 
previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any) over the 
net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identiﬁable assets 
acquired and the liabilities assumed.
 
Non-controlling interests that are present ownership interests 
and entitle their holders to a proportionate share of the 
entity’s net assets in the event of liquidation may be initially 
measured at the no controlling interests’ proportionate share 
of the recognised amounts of the acquiree’s identiﬁable net 
assets.
24. Goodwill
 
Goodwill arising on an acquisition of a business is carried at 
cost established at the date of acquisition of the business less 
accumulated impairment loss if any. 
 
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated 
to each of the Group’s cash generating units (CGU) that is 
expected to beneﬁt from the synergies of the combination.
 
A CGU to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for 
impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an 
indication that the unit may be impaired, if the recoverable 
amount of the CGU is less than its carrying amount, the 
impairment loss is allocated ﬁrst to reduce the carrying 
amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to 
the other assets of the units pro-rata based on the carrying 
amount of each asset in the unit, any impairment loss or 
goodwill is not reversed in subsequent period.
 
On disposal of relevant CGU the attributable amount of 
goodwill is included in the determination of the proﬁt or loss 
on disposal.

Gratuity (post-employment beneﬁts)
 
The Group provides for gratuity to employees in India as per the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. Employees who are in continuous 
service for a period of 5 years are eligible for gratuity. The amount of gratuity payable on retirement/ termination is the employees 
last drawn basic salary per month computed proportionately for 15 days salary multiplied for the number of years of service. The 
gratuity plan is a funded plan and the Group makes contributions to recognised/approved funds in India. The Group does not fully 
fund the liability and maintains a target level of funding to be maintained over a period of time based on estimations of expected 
gratuity payments.

The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, this is 
unlikely to occur,  and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the deﬁned beneﬁt 
obligation to signiﬁcant actuarial assumptions the same method (present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation calculated with the 
projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied as when calculating the deﬁned beneﬁt liability 
recognised in the balance sheet.
The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared to the prior period.
Risk Exposure
Through its deﬁned beneﬁt plans, the Company is exposed to a number of risks, the most signiﬁcant of which are detailed:
Investment risk
The present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt plan liability is calculated using a discount rate which is determined by 
reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds. If the return on plan asset 
is below this rate, it will create a plan deﬁcit. Currently, for the plan in India, it has a relatively balanced mix of 
investments in government securities, and other debt instruments.
Interest risk
A fall in the discount rate which is linked to the G.Sec. Rate will increase the present value of the liability requiring 
higher provision. A fall in the discount rate generally increases the mark to market value of the assets depending 
on the duration of asset.
Asset liability 
matching risk
The plan faces the ALM risk as to the matching cash ﬂow. Since the plan is invested in lines of Rule 101 of Income 
Tax Rules, 1962, this generally reduces ALM risk
Moratility risk
Since the beneﬁts under the plan is not payable for life time and payable till retirement age only, plan does not have 
any longevity risk.  
 
Concentration 
risk
Plan is having a concentration risk as all the assets are invested with the insurance entity and a default will wipe out 
all the assets. Although probability of this is very less as insurance companies have to follow regulatory guidelines.
Salary risk
The present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of members. 
As such, an increase in the salary of the members more than assumed level will increase the plan’s liability.
Maturity proﬁle of gratuity liability and Employer contribution
Expected contributions to post-employment beneﬁt plans for the year ending March 31, 2024 are Rs.Nil (as at March 31, 2023: Rs. Nil).
The weighted average duration (based on discounted cash ﬂows) of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation is 8 years (8 years as at March 
31, 2023).
The expected maturity analysis of undiscounted gratuity is as follows:

Note 51 : Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies
The Group’s principal ﬁnancial liabilities comprise of loans and borrowings, trade and other payables. The main purpose of these 
ﬁnancial liabilities is to ﬁnance the Group’s operations directly or indirectly. The Group’s principal ﬁnancial assets include investments, 
loans, trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents that derive directly from its operations.
The Group is exposed to market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The below note explains the sources of risk which the entity is exposed 
to and how the entity manages the risk :

Credit Risk
Credit risk is the risk that counterparty will not meet its obligations 
under a ﬁnancial instrument or customer contract, leading 
to a ﬁnancial loss. The Group is exposed to credit risk from its 
operating activities (primarily trade receivables) and from its 
ﬁnancing activities, including Fixed deposits with banks and 
ﬁnancial institutions and other ﬁnancial instruments.
An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date on an 
individual basis for major customers. In addition, a large number 
of minor receivables are grouped into homogenous groups and 
assessed for impairment collectively. The maximum exposure to 
credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class 
of ﬁnancial assets disclosed.
On account of adoption of Ind-AS 109, the Group uses expected 
credit loss model to assess the impairment loss or gain. The 
Group uses a provision matrix to compute the expected credit 
loss allowance for trade receivables. The provision matrix takes 
into account available external and internal credit risk factors and 
the Group’s historical experience for customers.
The Group has made adjustments in ECL Model to consider the 
impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the provision. The probability 
of default has been assessed considering the likelihood of 
increased credit risk and consequential default due to pandemic. 
The impact on collateral values is also assessed for determination 
of loss given default and reasonable haircuts are applied wherever 
necessary. The moratorium beneﬁt wherever extended has been 
taken into consideration for staging of loans in the Model. 
(` in Lakhs)
The Group offers loans secured by real estate/housing property/
investments. In order to migate credit risk, the Group also seeks 
collateral appropriate to the product segment and also ensure 
that Loan to value ratio is maintained as speciﬁed by regulator.
An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date 
based on the facts and circumstances existing on that date to 
identify expected losses on account of time value of money and 
credit risk. The credit quality of Loans and advances measured at 
amortised cost is primarily assessed by the Days Past Due (DPD) 
status and other qualitative factors leading to increase in credit 
risk.
In assessing the impairment of ﬁnancial assets under the 
expected credit loss `deﬁnes default when a loan obligation is 
overdue for more than 90 days (net of subsequent receipts as on 
the reporting date) and credit impared.

Market Risk
Market risk comprises two types of risk: interest rate risk and currency risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk include loans 
and borrowings and deposits
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash ﬂows of a ﬁnancial instrument will ﬂuctuate because of changes in market 
interest rates. The Company’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Company’s long-term debt 
obligations with ﬂoating interest rates. 
The Group manages its interest rate risk by having a balanced portfolio of ﬁxed and variable rate loans and borrowings. The Group’s 
policy is to keep balance between its borrowings at ﬁxed rates of interest. The difference between ﬁxed and variable rate interest 
amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount.
The exposure of the Company to interest rate changes at the end of the reporting period are as under:

Foreign currency risk
Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash ﬂows of an exposure will ﬂuctuate because of changes in foreign 
exchange rates. The Company’s exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates to purchase of  raw material of 
chemical and fertilizer products from out of the India. The Company manages its foreign currency risk by hedging the payables as and 
when considered necessary. When a derivative is entered into for the purpose of being a hedge, the Company negotiates the terms of 
those derivatives to match the terms of the hedged exposure. The Company hedges its exposure to ﬂuctuations on the translation into 
INR of its foreign payables in foreign currencies and by using foreign currency option or forward contracts.
Foreign Currency Sensitivity
The following tables demonstrate the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rate, with all other variables held 
constant. The impact on the Company’s proﬁt before tax is due to changes in the fair value of monetary assets and liabilities.
