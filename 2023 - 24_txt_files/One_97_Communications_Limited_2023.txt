assessing their potential impact, and implementing 
proactive measures to mitigate or manage them 
effectively. This includes risks related to product 
innovation and quality service, financial inclusion 
initiatives, and tax implications. By systematically 
addressing risks across various business areas, 
organizations can enhance decision-making, 
protect assets, and improve overall resilience in 
the face of uncertainty.
To adapt and mitigate 
risks effectively, we shall 
implement a systematic 
risk management 
framework tailored to 
address threats across 
all business areas, 
fostering a culture 
of awareness and 
accountability among 
employees. Effective risk

embed ESG principles into our core business practices and improve 
our governance. We aim to create lasting value for our employees,

Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, 
environmental, and social topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such 
consultations provided to the Board. 
We have implemented a strategic approach for stakeholder identification, prioritization, and 
engagement, synchronous with our ongoing efforts to implement our ‘Stakeholder Engagement 
Policy.’ This policy is meticulously designed to outline the purpose, scope, engagement plan, 
and communication details, all aimed at enhancing transparency and accountability. Throughout 
the year, our continuous engagement and regular interactions empower our teams to gather 
valuable feedback and information. This input is then shared with the senior management and 
reported to our ESG Committee for further review and action.
Our ESG Committee, operating under the guidance of the CSR Committee, plays a pivotal role 
in ensuring adherence to our ESG standards. This committee holds overall responsibility for 
effectively guiding, directing, and overseeing the Company’s ESG-related progress. Periodically, 
the ESG Committee presents its findings to the CSR Committee, which in turn offers necessary 
recommendations to the Board and management on pertinent matters.
The responsibilities of the ESG Committee encompass a range of tasks, including approving, 
noting, and ratifying ESG goals, targets, and strategies. Additionally, they consult on ESG 
related stakeholder matters, monitor performance, oversee the execution of ESG initiatives, and 
ensure alignment with long-term ESG commitments and targets. Encompassing various ESG 
dimensions such as energy, water, waste, human rights, and supply chain, the ESG Committee 
also oversees material ESG risks and opportunities, actively seeking to mitigate risks while 
considering their financial implications.

Yes, in the fiscal year 2023-24, guided by stakeholder consultations, we have begun 
implementing new policies developed in alignment with material topics and NGRBC principles. 
Furthermore, we have established an ESG committee and conducted financial inclusion 
sessions for women, along with a health and safety session for vendors.
We rely on internal stakeholder consultation for the identification and management of environmental 
and social topics. Additionally, to align our material topics with our business strategy and bring 
independence, we engaged an external consultant during the financial year, to gain comprehensive 
insights into emerging trends and best practices. In alignment with the sectoral guidance of leading 
ESG frameworks and indices, relevant material topics were identified and further refined.

and throughout the year, our ESG activities, targets and performance metrics across various 
departments will be developed accordingly.

Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of 
vulnerable/ marginalized stakeholder groups.  
We recognize the importance of giving back to society, and our company actively engages 
on various aspects of social and community development across India, in collaboration with 
numerous nonprofits to address the concerns of vulnerable/marginalized stakeholder groups. 
Aligned with our ‘CSR policy,’ which outlines the process of execution, utilization, monitoring, 
among others, our company focuses on addressing the concerns of these stakeholder groups. 
We continuously identify opportunities to improve the lives of the disadvantaged, vulnerable, 
and marginalized stakeholders through our ongoing CSR engagements.
Through one of our flagship educational CSR initiatives, Shikshit Bharat, we aim to bridge 
the digital gap between rural and urban areas, leveraging the pivotal role of technology in 
fostering equitable development. Via this program, we have distributed 186 laptops and 33 
desktops to schools, nonprofits, and government bodies, primarily targeting the women in rural 
areas, providing digital tools to overcome educational, employment, and economic barriers, 
empowering them towards independence. Also, in collaboration with the Scaler Foundation, 
Paytm extended a scholarship to 24 underprivileged engineering students in Bangalore, aiming 
to support their higher education.
We also conducted comprehensive financial literacy sessions as part of our volunteering 
activities. These sessions have reached over 1000 women representing diverse organizations, 
delving into fundamental principles of finance management. By equipping participants with 
essential knowledge and skills, we empower them to navigate the intricacies of finance with 
confidence. Moreover, our employee volunteering efforts encompass 179 volunteers dedicating 
their time, benefiting a total of 5001 individuals, and accumulating a remarkable total of 1342 
volunteering hours.

allowing employees to directly raise grievances through the HRMS platform. 
Aligned with the whistle-blower mechanism, stakeholders are expected to report concerns 
such as bribery, corruption suspicions, behavioral issues, or discrimination. Confidentiality 
of complainants is upheld, with reporting facilitated through the web portal "Navex Global." 
Detailed instructions for reporting are available on the intranet and in the ABAC Policy on the 
Company's website.
Each complaint submitted through the Navex portal receives a unique case number for tracking 
purposes. Timely investigations are conducted, ensuring regulatory compliance. Following 
investigation completion, a report with recommended actions is submitted to relevant 
stakeholders, including the Disciplinary Action Committee, guided by the Consequence 
Management Policy. This policy ensures protection against retaliation for complainants raising 
concerns in good faith, regardless of their ultimate substantiation.

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and 
harassment cases. 
As mentioned in our Code of Conduct, the Company and all its affiliate Companies shall 
provide equal opportunities to all its employees/Personnel and all qualified applicants for 
employment without regard to their race, caste, religion, colour, ancestry, marital status, work 
experience, gender, sexual orientation, age, nationality, ethnic origin or disability. We have 
adopted policies which reinforce to the stakeholders, who raise complaints on a concrete and 
reasonable belief about a violation, that they will not be subjected to any kind of retaliation 
such as discrimination, reprisal, harassment, victimization etc. irrespective of the concern 
being ultimately substantiated. 
The Company has zero tolerance for any kind of harassment and discrimination. Our Human 
Resource policies and Code of Conduct promote diversity and equality in the workplace, as 
well as compliance with all local labour laws, while encouraging the adoption of international 
best practices.
Employee policies and practices are administered in a manner consistent with applicable laws 
and other provisions of the Code of Conduct, respect for the right to privacy and the right to 
be heard, and that in all matters equal opportunity is provided to those eligible and decisions 
are based on merit.
In addition, the POSH Policy has been formed under the provisions of the Sexual Harassment of 
Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, to prohibit, prevent or 
deter the commission of acts of sexual harassment at workplace and to provide the procedure 
for the redressal of complaints pertaining to sexual harassment. In case any allegations of sexual 
harassment are substantiated by the ICC, appropriate disciplinary action shall be taken against 
the accused. Disciplinary action may include transfer, withholding promotion, suspension or 
even dismissal. This action shall be in addition to any legal recourse sought by the complainant. 
The Company also has a whistle blower mechanism that empowers its employees to raise 
the concerns, if any, for instances like bribery, suspicion of corruption, behavioral issues, 
discrimination etc. via this vigil mechanism. Complaints reported to any internal stakeholder 
(reporting manager/ HR team/ Compliance Officer) of any potential violation are channelized 
to the whistle blowing mechanism. The identity of the complainants is kept confidential during 
the investigation. The Company has enabled the web portal “Navex Global” to take anonymous 
complaints and facilitate reporting of the protected disclosures routed through the web links, 
toll-free number and application access mentioned in detail on the Intranet, Deep Purple. The 
Company investigates all the complaints reported under the whistle blowing mechanism after 
the due approval from a member of the Disciplinary Action Committee in a timely manner. The 
investigating team ensures compliance with all the regulatory requirements during the course of 
investigation. After the completion of the investigation, a report is submitted with recommended 
measures to the Disciplinary Action Committee. The Disciplinary Action Committee initiates

We are proud to represent our nation on the global stage, actively advocating for sustainable 
practices. Since December 2017, our Founder & CEO, Vijay Shekhar Sharma, has been serving 
as the United Nations Environment Programme’s (UNEP) advocate  for Clean Air. He has been 
instrumental in driving environmental action and awareness, championing UNEP’s global 
#BreatheLife campaign, which focuses on improving air quality and influencing policy and 
citizen action for a healthier future.
In collaboration with UNEP, our CSR arm, Paytm Foundation, launched the Air Quality Action 
Forum (AQAF) last financial year. This national-level forum brings together regulators, national 
and international philanthropic organisations, international development agencies, and 
the corporate sector. The goal is to identify needs, gaps, and solutions to India’s air quality 
problems, ensuring structured project implementation with a yearly action plan. AQAF facilitates 
an inclusive approach to tackling air pollution through stakeholder engagement.
Vijay also serves on the Advisory Board of the Green Digital Finance Alliance. This Alliance 
explores the potential for digital finance and fintech innovations to reshape the financial system 
in alignment with sustainable development goals. Our initiatives, such as reducing paper 
usage by promoting digital transactions and e-receipts, reflect our commitment to conserving 
resources and reducing pollution.
Paytm’s ‘Box of Joy’ initiative epitomises purposeful gifting with environmental consciousness 
and community engagement. Central to this initiative is the ‘Vriksharopan’ project, where Paytm 
pledges to plant two trees for each employee in the newly established Paytm Forest near the 
National Capital Region (NCR), in collaboration with the Sankalptaru Foundation. This afforestation 
effort addresses environmental concerns and contributes to socio-economic empowerment by 
providing livelihood opportunities to local communities responsible for nurturing these trees.
Each tree planted under the ‘Box of Joy’ initiative is geotagged, allowing employees to monitor 
their growth and visit the site. This deepens their connection with nature and reinforces 
Paytm’s dedication to community welfare and environmental sustainability. This comprehensive 
approach exemplifies how Paytm seamlessly integrates joy, environmental stewardship, and

The Company's operations do not involve the use of hazardous or toxic chemicals. In managing 
electronic waste (e-waste) responsibly, the Company has implemented comprehensive 
systems across all its facilities in India. Our dedication to environmental stewardship extends 
to the handling of e-waste assets, which undergo a structured disposal process. We strictly 
adhere to our comprehensive E-Waste Policy, ensuring the proper management of e-waste 
resulting from our business operations. To uphold these standards, we collaborate with e-waste 
vendors approved by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), guaranteeing responsible 
and compliant e-waste handling practices across our operations.
The Company has also devised a comprehensive waste collection strategy in accordance with 
the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to the CPCB. To efficiently manage 
other forms of waste, the Company segregates and stores generated waste into two distinct 
categories: dry waste and wet waste, utilizing appropriate bins for this purpose. All waste 
generated on our premises is managed through our partnerships with government-authorized 
agencies equipped with sorting and processing facilities.

The Emergency Response Plan (ERP) documentation encompasses the following 
key components:
 
 
Establishment of an Emergency Response Team (ERT): Comprising individuals trained to 
prepare for and respond to emergency incidents, the ERT addresses a wide spectrum 
of potential crises, including natural disasters and industrial accidents. Through ongoing 
training and awareness-building exercises, the ERT enhances preparedness and 
response capabilities.
 
 
Deployment of a Quick Response Team (QRT): Operating round-the-clock as the initial 
responders, the QRT comprises a designated driver and two Civil Defence Volunteers 
skilled in firefighting, search and rescue, and first aid. During emergencies such as 
fires, the Emergency Coordinator assumes primary responsibility for coordinating 
staff response efforts and liaising with external emergency services. Additionally, the 
Emergency Coordinator oversees the training and designation of QRT members in fire 
prevention techniques.

Limitations
TUVI did not perform any assurance procedures 
on the prospective information disclosed in 
the Report, including targets, expectations, 
and ambitions. Consequently, TUVI draws no 
conclusion on the prospective information. 
During the assurance process, TUVI did not come 
across any limitation to the agreed scope of the 
assurance engagement. TUVI did not verify any 
ESG goals and claim through this assignment. 
TUVI disclaims any liability or co-responsibility 
1) for any decision a person or an entity would

sample desired for limited level of assurance; the 
responsibility for the authenticity of submitted 
data entirely lies with ‘Paytm’. TUVI has taken 
reference of the financial figures from the audited 
financial statements. ‘Paytm’ will be responsible 
for the appropriate application of the financial 
data. The application of this assurance statement

Water
1.	
The raw water consumption at the 50 fleet 
offices is estimated based on the studies 
provided by the per day per employee 
water consumption as per CWGA studies.
Waste
1.	
The waste data was not monitored for the 
50 fleet offices; thus, the reported waste 
values are limited to the 20 regional offices.
2.	 The generated non-hazardous waste in 
the 20 regional offices is handed over to 
the land lord. Thus, traceability to disposal 
method is missing. Thus, all generated non-
hazardous waste is thus conservatively 
assumed to be landfilled.
Our Responsibility
TUVI's 
responsibility 
in 
relation 
to 
this 
engagement is to perform a limited level of 
assurance and to express a conclusion based 
on the work performed. Our engagement did not 
include an assessment of the adequacy or the 
effectiveness of Paytm's strategy, management 
of ESG-related issues or the sufficiency of 
the Report against BRSR reporting principles, 
other than those mentioned in the scope of the 
assurance. TUVI's responsibility regarding this 
verification is in reference to the agreed scope 
of work, which includes assurance of non-
financial quantitative and qualitative information 
(09 attributes as per Annexure I - Format of 
BRSR Core) disclosed by ‘Paytm’. Reporting

Conflict of Interest
In the context of BRSR requirements set by 
SEBI, addressing conflict of interest is crucial 
to maintain high integrity and independence 
of assurance engagements. As per SEBI 
guidelines, 
assurance 
providers 
need 
to 
disclose any potential conflict of interest 
that could compromise the independence or 
neutrality of their assessments. TUVI diligently 
identifies any relationships, affiliations, or 
financial interests that could potentially cause 
conflict of interest. We proactively implement 
measures to mitigate or manage these conflicts, 
ensuring independence and impartiality in our 
assurance engagements. We provide clear and 
transparent disclosures about any identified 
conflicts of interest in our assurance statement. 
We recognize that failure to address conflict 
of interest adequately could undermine the 
Statutory Reports

creditability of the assurance process and the 
reliability of the reported information. Therefore, 
we strictly adhere to SEBI guidelines and take 
necessary measures to avoid, disclose, or 
mitigate conflicts of interest effectively.
