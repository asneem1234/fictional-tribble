Indicate whether 
risk or opportunity 
(R/O)
Rationale for identifying the 
risk/opportunity
Financial implications of 
the risk or opportunity
1.
Printing and 
writing paper 
segment which 
is the prime 
grade among 
company's 
products, is 
expected to 
be negatively 
impacted in the 
near future
Opportunity & 
Risk
Risk:
Will affect the margins of the 
business that the Company 
operates. 
Opportunity: 
(i)	 Provides 
opportunity 
to 
diversify into other product 
range to cater to different 
segments of markets. 
Adverse since margins 
of alternate grades are 
likely to be lower when 
compared with printing 
and writing segment.
187
S 
No.
Material issue 
identified
Indicate whether 
risk or opportunity 
(R/O)
Rationale for identifying the 
risk/opportunity
Financial implications of 
the risk or opportunity
(ii)		To 
take 
advantage 
of 
restrictions 
on 
single 
use plastic materials, by 
developing 
alternatives. 
The Company has been 
making 
necessary 
investments to diversify 
its product range and has 
also been strengthening its 
marketing network, as well 
as the supply chain
2.
Failure of 
Monsoon and 
absence of 
water flow 
in the River 
from where 
the Company 
draws its water 
requirements
Risk
Risk: Since water shortage 
will directly disrupt the pulp 
and paper production. The 
Company is taking various 
initiatives to curtail quantum 
of fresh water used in the 
process
Since 
the 
company 
is taking initiative to 
curtail  usage of fresh 
water, there may not be 
any adverse  financial 
implication  
3.
Wood 
availability
Risk
Risk: 
Since 
wood 
pulp 
constitutes the major portion 
in the pulp furnish of the 
paper manufacturing in the 
Company. The Company has 
well defined tree farming 
strategy to enable marginal 
land owners in nearby districts 
to grow trees in about 22982 
acres annually. This enables 
Company to be wood positive. 
This risk is further addressed 
through a 4 pronged strategy : 
-	 Adding Newer species of 
wood to its raw material 
base 
-	 Enhancing the sourcing of 
wood from regions outside 
Tamil Nadu 
-	 Direct connect with Farmers 
through Contract Farming 
initiatives
 -	Enhancing usage of bagasse 
& deinked pulp to reduce 
dependency on wood pulp.
Negative since shortage 
of wood will result in 
company resorting to use 
of costlier sourced pulp.

4.
Dependency 
on Imported 
Coal
Opportunity & 
Risk
Risk: Since this results in 
increase in energy cost. 
Opportunity: 
Since 
this 
opens up avenues to move 
towards non-fossil fuel based 
energy sources. 
The 
company 
has 
continuously 
taken 
steps 
to reduce its dependency 
on Coal. The company is 
taking adequate measure to 
address this issue through 
renewable energy sources 
and bio-fuels. Further steps 
are being taken to increase 
the share by augmenting in-
house pulp production
Neutral 
since 
the 
company’s dependency 
on Coal has come down.
5.
Monsoon 
failures 
affecting the 
Sugar Industry 
thereby 
restricting 
the supply of 
Bagasse
Risk
Risk: Since Bagasse is a 
key input material for the 
company. 
The 
Company 
has its own Captive source 
with Bagasse sourced from 
Associate 
Company. 
The 
Bagasse production by the 
Associate Company is more 
than the material required by 
TNPL.
Neutral since bagasse 
represents only some 
portion of the pulp mix 
in the operations.

a)	 Does the entity 
have procedures 
in place for 
sustainable 
sourcing?  
(Yes/No)
Yes, “Sustainable Sourcing" lies at the heart of TNPL's environmental commitment. 
Launched in 2004, TNPL's Plantation initiative is grounded in the pursuit of self-
sufficiency in pulpwood. Over 19 years, this endeavour has spread across an extensive 
2,56,756-acre area, aiming to source economically viable, socially acceptable, and 
environmentally compatible pulpwood. This initiative encompasses several key 
objectives. It seeks to establish renewable plantations by transforming barren and 
degraded lands into thriving ecosystems, extending tree cover beyond natural forests.
TNPL's responsible sourcing extends beyond paper production, with pulpwood 
procurement, mechanized harvesting, and aid for cyclone-affected farmers 
showcasing the company's commitment to ethical and eco-conscious practices. 
The positive ecological impact of the plantation includes nurturing biodiversity and 
contributing to reforestation and water balance. With sustainable sourcing deeply 
ingrained, TNPL's Plantation Program stands as a symbol of holistic, environmentally 
sensitive practices in the paper industry.
Additionally, TNPL's main site demonstrates unwavering dedication to efficiency and 
sustainability, with 100% utilization of lime sludge and dry fly ash, as well as innovative 
approaches in the Soda Recovery Plant that maximize resource utilization. These 
practices exemplify TNPL's commitment to environmentally conscious operations.
b)	 If yes, what 
percentage 
of inputs 
were sourced 
sustainably?  
(By Quantity)
The company sourced inputs sustainably, with 100% coming from bagasse  and 88% 
from pulpwood.

within the factory premises to produce Cement from Paper Mill wastes such as lime 
sludge-109740 MT, Lime Grit-4313.7 MT and fly ash-36939 MT into high grade cement 
as part of its solid waste management system. During the financial year 2023-2024, 
The Company has manufactured 2,00,154 MT of cement.
Generated Lime sludge and lime grits wastes are safely reused as raw material in 
Lime kiln & TNPL LSFM respectively.
(d) Other waste
The organic waste generated from the process of pulp mill is effectively utilized as a 
fuel to generate wealth from waste. The company has utilized 153309 MT of internally 
generated organic waste such as bagasse pith, wood dust, and pulpwood bark etc., 
and utilized the same in the Power Boilers, which has resulted in the conservation of 
50,251 MT of imported coal for Financial Year 2023-2024.
The Unit - I has generated 378592 MT of Black liquor solid from hard wood pulp and 
chemical bagasse pulp plant during the Financial Year 2023-24 and fired the same

5.	 Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its coverage 
and implementation: 
Water stands as a cornerstone in pulp and paper manufacturing, playing a pivotal role throughout the paper 
production process. The usage of water spans multiple key areas, including raw material cleaning, pulp 
mills, showers on washers, paper formation and boiler operations. At TNPL, the primary water source is 
fresh water drawn from the Cauvery River. By integrating cutting-edge technologies, TNPL has effectively 
harnessed water recycling in its operations. 
Driven by a strong commitment to sustainability, TNPL actively seeks ways to lessen its reliance on 
freshwater intake. The company has a vision to potentially transition to Zero Liquid Discharge, harnessing 
modern innovations for this purpose. A noteworthy distinction is that TNPL pursues a minimum liquid 
discharge strategy rather than the conventional Zero Liquid Discharge.
With unwavering commitment, the company diligently complies with SPCB regulations, overseeing 
wastewater management with meticulous care. The outcome of this dedication is evident as treated 
effluent from the Effluent Treatment Plant finds purposeful use within the TNPL Effluent Water Lift 
Irrigation Society (TEWLIS), supporting on-land irrigation. This eco-conscious approach extends with the 
presence of a 20 KLD on-site sewage treatment plant, pivotal in the company’s strategic blueprint. Here, 
treated sewage water serves a dual purpose - nurturing thriving plantations while effectively suppressing 
dust.
Unit I resonate TNPL’s sustainability drive as treated wastewater irrigates 1650 acres, facilitated through 
the TEWLIS Scheme. Similarly, Unit-II takes a green initiative, channelling all generated wastewater to 
irrigate the company’s vast 650-acre land. This transformation is realized through the implementation of 
an advanced wastewater treatment plant.

8.	 Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If yes, then provide 
detail:
At TNPL, the commitment to environmental responsibility and carbon footprint reduction is evident 
through our pursuit of green energy generation and adoption of a circular economy approach. Here 
are the key points regarding energy reduction initiatives:
Green Energy Generation:
•	 TNPL has embraced renewable energy resources by establishing a 15 MW Wind Farms in Tirunelveli 
District in FY 1993-94. Over the years, capacity additions in four phases have increased the plant’s 
capacity to 35.5 MW.
•	 Wind farms cover more than 1,100 acres, strategically located to harness seasonal winds during monsoon 
seasons.
•	 Low Tension (LT) Rooftop Solar Power Plants, with a 3 KW capacity, were installed in wind farms to reduce 
LT consumption bills.
•	 TNPL remains dedicated to a carbon-neutral mantra through the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). 
The company has recognized 1,90,920 Certified Emission Reductions for energy production without 
carbon emissions from wind farms.
Resource Utilization and Efficiency:
•	 Unused spaces among Wind Electric Generators are transformed into eucalyptus plantations, 
repurposing 2,300 Tons of EH pulpwood. This initiative supports carbon sequestration and sustainable 
forestry methods.
•	 TNPL employs an eco-friendly process where bagasse wash water is treated in a bio-methanation plant, 
producing biogas. This biogas replaces furnace oil in the lime kiln, curbing pollution. This pioneering 
Clean Development Project in the paper industry reduces approximately 45,000 MT of CO2 annually.
•	 Carbon emission reduction efforts are extended through the conversion of bagasse pith and wood dust 
into biofuel. This biofuel is utilized in the paper mill’s boiler as an energy-efficient and safe alternative to 
fossil fuels.
212
Efficient Resource Planning:
•	 TNPL ingeniously repurposes flue gas from the cement mill to facilitate fuel drying in the coal mill and 
lime sludge drying, crucial for paper mill’s operation. This process also heats raw materials in TNPL’s 
cement manufacturing, boosting efficiency and reducing energy consumption.
•	 Caustic waste is reused in the Soda Recovery Plant, facilitating power generation and reducing 
environmental impact.
•	 Utilizing the organic waste material, lignin, extracted as black liquor after wood and bagasse pulping, 
TNPL repurposes it in the Soda Recovery Plant to generate steam. This steam is then employed in the 
turbo generator as an eco-friendly alternative to fossil fuels, resulting in cost-effective and sustainable 
power generation.
•	 Waste materials from the paper mill, such as lime sludge and fly ash, are reused to produce high-grade 
cement, minimizing waste and promoting sustainability.
These energy reduction initiatives reflect TNPL’s dedication to responsible energy practices, circular 
economy adoption, and sustainable resource utilization.
