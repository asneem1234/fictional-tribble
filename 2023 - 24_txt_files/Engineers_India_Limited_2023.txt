or negative implications)
1
Environment: 
The 
climate 
change
Risk
There is a strong need for 
the industry to reduce their 
carbon footprints amidst 
the growing concerns of 
global warming.
Increased 
focus 
on energy efficient 
processes 
and 
m i n i m i z a t i o n 
of 
wastes. 
The 
company 
has 
declared to become 
net 
zero 
carbon 
emitting corporate 
by the year 2035.
Negative: 
The initial investments would be 
required to install clean energy 
facilities to reduce the scope-1 
and scope-2 emissions of the 
company.
2
Environment: 
To offer value-
added 
and 
clean 
energy 
t e c h n o l o g y 
to the clients 
to 
meet 
their 
energy 
t r a n s i t i o n 
objectives.
Opportunity
The 
ongoing 
energy 
transition 
requires 
the 
implementation of clean 
energy technologies in the 
energy sector which is our 
core 
business 
segment. 
EIL 
is 
already 
involved 
in development of clean 
energy technology both on 
its own or in collaboration 
with the industry, national 
laboratory and academia.
-
Negative: It requires manpower 
efforts 
in 
development 
of 
green 
energy 
technologies 
and investments/ funding for 
collaborative 
clean 
energy 
technology 
development. 
The 
investment 
would 
be 
largely 
funded by the R&D budget of the 
company. It will help secure more 
business in the clean energy 
segment that will significantly 
outnumber the initial investment

7.	 Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets and 
achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the   placement of this disclosure: 
In its long journey of six decades since its inception in the year 1965, EIL has remained focused in delivering innovative technological 
solutions tailored to the evolving needs of the energy industry, aligning closely with both Indian energy sector demands and global 
trends. The organization’s strategy has consistently integrated Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance (ESG) principles, 
which is exemplified by its vision statement: “To be a Global Leader Offering Total Energy Solutions for a Sustainable Future.”
One of the foremost ESG challenges across industrial sectors is the cultural shift towards sustainability, which EIL has addressed 
through various initiatives aimed at optimizing water and electricity consumption, adhering to the 3Rs principle (Reduce, Reuse, and 
Recycle) for resource conservation. Efforts such as providing washable tea mugs to employees have significantly reduced plastic 
and other waste generation in office complexes. Moreover, the organization has progressively reduced paper use by embracing 
digital interventions.
EIL’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Policy is dedicated to uplifting communities through inclusive growth and environmental 
stewardship. The company is committed to transforming the nation’s social infrastructure sustainably, aligning its CSR initiatives 
with national priorities.
In its commitment to fostering a greener environment, EIL spearheaded the development of a Miyawaki forest in Gurugram, 
Haryana, aimed at enhancing air quality, conserving water, and supporting local flora and fauna. Over 8,250 saplings were planted 
in April 2023, with a remarkable survival rate of around 95%.
Another critical ESG imperative is the development of sustainable technologies and products, which EIL has pursued by diversifying 
its portfolio to include energy-efficient infrastructure, biofuels, green hydrogen and Solar CST. In the past year, EIL forged strategic 
partnerships through MoUs with public and private entities to advance technologies relevant to the energy industry.
EIL is currently executing one of India’s largest Biorefinery projects in Assam for ABRPL (a JV of NRL, Fortum, and Chempolis, OY, 
Finland) and has developed the technology for Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) in collaboration with CSIR-IIP, Dehradun. Additionally, 
EIL is at the forefront of green hydrogen projects in India, implementing various green hydrogen projects with applications in 
refining and integrating into the City Gas Distribution (CGD) network.
In summary, EIL has emerged as a key stakeholder in providing ESG-compliant, sustainable, and low-carbon technological solutions 
to industrial sectors in their journey towards decarbonization.

Note-A: 
EIL has developed several innovative technological solutions to address the climate change issues pertinent to its domain 
industries either on its own or in collaboration with private and public sector entities both in India and overseas. Sulphur 
Recovery Unit is one of the important units in the oil refinery and EIL has designed several Sulphur Recovery Units (SRU) in the 
past for its esteemed clients to mitigate emissions. Ammonia rich gases produced in SWSU are destructed in SRU to convert 
NH3 into N2 and H2O. In this process, valuable NH3 molecule is lost. Technology has been developed to recover  NH3 molecule 
from ammonia rich sour gases and converted to valuable products like aqueous ammonia / anhydrous ammonia.
EIL has continued its efforts in BIO ATF technology development in the current financial year as well. Further, EIL executed 
collaborative agreements with reputed national laboratories and Oil majors to catapult its efforts towards environment and 
sustainability. Some of them includes, EIL has extended the synergistic potential with research organizations, educational
