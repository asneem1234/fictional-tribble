 Nuvama has established robust internal mechanisms to redress grievances related to human rights issues like 
misbehaviour, discrimination based on gender, caste, sex and sexual harassment of employees. The company’s 
framework includes several policies aimed at protecting human rights and facilitating grievance resolution:
ŉ

 Prevention of Sexual Harassment (POSH): This policy, in compliance with national laws, addresses sexual 
harassment at work, providing clear protocols for handling complaints. In addition, the company also provides 
mandatory POSH training for all its employees reiterating its commitment to human rights and prevention of 
sexual harassment.
ŉ
Ħŉ
 Whistleblower Mechanism: Enables employees and stakeholders to report unethical behavior or violations 
anonymously and securely.
ŉ
Ħŉ
 Disciplinary Mechanism: Ensures prompt and effective action against human rights violations and breaches 
of company policy.
ŉ
Ħŉ
 Equal Opportunity Policy: Upholds principles of non-discrimination and equality, ensuring all employees are 
treated fairly regardless of their background.
ŉ
Ħŉ
 No-Retaliation Policy: The company also enforces a strict no-retaliation policy, which is clearly outlined in 
its Prevention of Sexual Harassment (POSH) and Whistleblower policies.

policies and their rights. An independent redressal process, supported by these frameworks, helps ensure that 
the workplace remains safe and respectful for all employees. All human rights related grievances are centrally 
managed by the ESG committee.
