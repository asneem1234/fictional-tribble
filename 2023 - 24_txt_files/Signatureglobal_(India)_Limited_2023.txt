* The Group has a Grievance Redressal Mechanism through various policies and procedures. For example, the 
Group has a well-defined Whistle-Blower Policy/ Vigil Mechanism (https://www.signatureglobal.in/pdf/investors/
Whistle-Blower-Policy.pdf ), Code of Ethics, Grievance Redressal Policy and Policy for Prevention of Sexual 
Harassment (POSH) (available on Company’s Intranet) for all of its women employees to allow for the expression 
of concerns and grievances. Moreover, there is a dedicated Grievance Redress Committee, which is responsible 
for addressing the concerns and grievances of both internal as well as external stakeholders.
 
 
 Further, the Group through its Secretarial Team takes care of the grievances of the members of the Company 
through a dedicated portal i.e., Online Dispute Resolution Mechanism for Members of the Group (https://
www.signatureglobal.in/pdf/ONLINE-RESOLUTION-OF-DISPUTES.pdf) and a specific email id (investors@
signatureglobal.in).
 
 
 Furthermore, there is a dedicated section on the Group’s website i.e., “Customer Support (https://www.signatureglobal.
in/customer_support.php)”, which provides the customers with multiple mechanisms to lodge their complaints or 
provide their feedback such as by means of email id, dedicated helpline number, SMS and whatsapp, downloading 
a digital application.
 
 
** Since, SGIL got listed in September 2023, therefore FY 2023-24 is the first year of reporting BRSR, hence, the 
data w.r.t. Previous Financial Year is not available.

(Indicate positive

The Company’s inability to 
adapt to swiftly transforming 
regulatory mandates may 
culminate in detrimental 
consequences, thereby 
undermining the confidence of 
stakeholders. The emergence 
of environmental and societal 
regulations poses a risk of 
potential non-compliance. 
If these are not adequately 
addressed, it could lead to 
the imposition of fines and 
penalties, and negatively 
affect the Company’s brand 
reputation.
• To raise awareness w.r.t. 
compliances, we conduct 
regular awareness 
sessions training for our 
employees and provide 
them with other necessary 
resources to raise 
awareness amongst them.
• There is a dedicated 
team, which make sure 
a thorough approach 
is being followed to 
risk assessment and 
appropriate mitigation 
measures are being taken.
• Before starting any 
development project, 
the management makes 
sure that the necessary 
regulatory permissions 
are available through 
a specific governance 
framework.

Climate 
change 
adaptation
Risk
The effects of climate 
change are being seen in 
nearly every region and 
industry. It can lead to both 
physical risks as well as 
transitional risks such as 
natural calamities, escalating 
average temperatures, and 
rising sea levels etc. This 
could potentially lead to future 
implications, manifested in 
the form of expenses incurred 
to repair and replace assets 
damaged by any natural 
disasters, and the subsequent 
downtime of properties.
We at Signatureglobal are 
committed to using a variety 
of strategies to tackle climate 
change, which includes 
incorporating sustainable 
practices in our products and 
services. Further, we are 
an EDGE-certified Green 
Building Developer and 
also a member of the Indian 
Green Building Council 
(IGBC). We constantly

Biodiversity 
Conservation 
and 
Restoration
Risk and 
Opportunity
Loss of biodiversity may result 
in regulatory challenges, 
harm to one’s reputation, and 
higher operating expenses. 
Furthermore, there may be 
dangers to the long-term 
sustainability and value of 
real estate investments due 
to the reduction in ecological 
services and the possible 
disturbance of habitats.
Further, one of our top 
priorities as a Group is 
to mitigate any dangers 
and dedicate our efforts to 
protecting the biodiversity 
in and around our activities. 
It will improve our influence 
on the environment and 
fosters goodwill among 
our stakeholders and the 
community.
Before starting any 
construction activity, we give 
priority to environmental 
impact assessments, taking 
into account the effects on 
human health, culture, and 
the socioeconomic system.

Health and 
Safety
Risk
Considering the nature of our 
operations, health and safety 
are considered as potential 
risk for our business.
One of our Group’s key 
values is putting the health 
and safety of our employees 
first. Ensuring a safe work 
environment not only boosts 
employee satisfaction but also 
helps them reach their full 
potential. Numerous mishaps 
involving safety might result 
from inefficient management 
of health and safety 
procedures. Therefore, we at 
Signatureglobal places the 
highest priority on ensuring 
the safety of our employees, 
contractors and local 
communities surrounding our 
project sites.
• All our project sites are 
certified Occupational 
Health and Safety 
Management Systems as 
per ISO 45001.
• Regular training sessions 
are being conducted on 
various Occupational 
Health and Safety aspects 
to sensitize our employees 
and contractors and instil 
a culture of safety.
• Safety Performance 
Review Meetings are 
being held at frequent

Water 
Management
Risk and
Opportunity
Water is one of the essential 
resources required during 
construction, operation and 
maintenance. With the rapid 
increase in population and 
other irregularities due to 
climate change, water is 
becoming a scarce resource. 
Therefore, it is important for 
the organisations to focus 
on water efficiency and 
conservation.
• All our projects are 
designed considering the 
concept of Zero Liquid 
Discharge, wherein 
Sewage Treatment Plants 
(STP) with dual plumbing 
system are installed. 
These systems are 
designed to ensure that all 
wastewater is treated and 
recycled and used

Customer 
Satisfaction
Opportunity
Since customer happiness 
serves as a reliable indicator 
of brand value and business 
performance, it is a crucial 
part of our business 
approach. It gives us 
important information about 
what customers anticipate 
from us and gives us the 
chance to guarantee excellent 
customer satisfaction. In order 
to maintain a high degree 
of customer service quality, 
it helps us to understand 
more about the needs of our 
customers and the caliber of 
the products and services that 
are being offered.

Data 
Protection 
and Security
Risk
The increasing reliance 
on digital platforms and 
technologies for operations, 
transactions, and customer 
interactions necessitates 
robust data protection 
measures. There is a risk of 
unauthorized access, data 
breaches, or cyber-attacks, 
which could lead to the loss, 
theft, or misuse of sensitive 
data, including proprietary 
information and personal 
data of clients. Such incidents 
could result in regulatory 
penalties, reputational 
damage, and loss of client 
trust.
Respecting the rights to 
personal data privacy is a 
top priority for the us. To 
ensure a standardised and 
high degree of protection for 
Personal Data processes by 
the Group, the Group has 
embraced global protection 
standards. Further, we are 
ISO 27001 compliant.

• Implementation of a

Risk
There is a potential risk 
associated with the inability 
to attract or retain the 
appropriate talent. This risk 
is further exacerbated by 
the increasing number of 
career options available in 
the market, which could lead 
to higher attrition rates. Such 
a scenario could adversely 
impact the operational 
efficiency and overall 
performance of the real estate 
business option.
Maintaining and identifying 
vital talent is a top priority 
in order to keep up with 
competitiveness and 
growth. A cohesive work 
environment is fostered by 
team building exercises. 
We appropriately recognize 
and award our staff. With 
policies such as Grievance 
Redressal Policy and POSH, 
we uphold a secure and 
welcoming work environment 
for our employees.

Human Rights Risk
Considering the nature of the 
Real Estate Industry, which 
is a labour-intensive industry, 
it has always been the focus 
of human rights organisations 
for their labour management 
practices.
Human rights advocacy and 
protection are essential to 
our Group’s success. It is 
our responsibility as ethical 
corporate citizens to uphold 
the human rights of all of our 
stakeholders including our 
employees and contractors. 
Human rights breaches will 
damage our reputation, have 
a negative financial impact, 
and erode stakeholder trust.
• There is an established 
grievance redressal 
mechanism, which takes 
care of complaints.
• Regular trainings are 
being conducted for all 
our employees to raise 
awareness of human

Local 
Community 
Development
Risk and 
Opportunity
Though construction activities 
contribute to economic 
and social development. 
However, they might also put 
the environment and nearby 
local communities at risk. 
Activities such as clearing, 
grading, and using dangerous 
chemicals are a few 
examples of activities that can 
harm the neighbouring local 
communities. Environmental 
concerns and community 
opposition may cause project 
delays or project cancellations 
in certain circumstances. This 
may have a detrimental effect 
on the Group’s earnings and 
expansion prospects.
Our Company uses 
Corporate Social 
Responsibility (CSR) 
programs to actively interact 
with the community. We 
make investments in 
initiatives and programs that 
help communities with their 
social, environmental, and 
financial needs. By working 
together with the community, 
we hope to have a positive, 
long-lasting effect that raises 
everyone’s standard of living.

products. However, the Group has implemented robust processes to manage waste generated during the operation and 
maintenance of buildings within its projects. These processes ensure that waste is appropriately recycled, reused, or 
treated in accordance with relevant regulatory requirements.
 
 Furthermore, non-performing assets that are no longer usable due to hardware issues are meticulously identified. 
With the assistance of the internal teams, these assets are dispatched to government-authorized e-waste dismantling 
and recycling units for safe disposal. The disposal of assets adheres strictly to the E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2016. 
Upon disposal, we obtain a certificate of receipt from the e-waste handler.

of our corporate safety strategy, we conduct a risk assessment that provides the factual basis for activities 
aimed at reducing losses from identified hazards at the workplace. During the Hazard Assessment, all activities, 
both routine and non-routine, in each section are selected. We then conduct the Hazard Assessment to identify 
significant risks. For all significant risks identified, we define control measures to mitigate these risks.
 
 
• 
 Daily Site Inspection: The site team carries out daily inspections to ensure safety protocols are being followed 
and to identify any potential hazards that could lead to injuries.

of the workplace to assess the effectiveness of health and safety management systems, identify areas for 
improvement, and ensure compliance with safety regulations.

10.  Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your 
Company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted 
to manage such wastes.
 
 Management of waste in a responsible manner is a critical component of sustainable project development. In this context, 
waste management involves the elimination of waste where it’s possible, minimisation of waste where it’s feasible, and 
the reuse of materials that could otherwise become waste. Signatureglobal has implemented appropriate measures 
for handling, storage, transportation, and disposal of waste during both the construction and operation phases of the 
projects. These measures constitute the waste management practices followed at our construction sites.
 
 For non-hazardous waste, which includes metal scraps and construction debris, the maximum amount of waste that 
can be reused is indeed reused at the site. Additionally, we collaborate with authorised recyclers to ensure the proper 
disposal and recycling of waste. The hazardous waste is responsibly disposed of through authorised third party vendors, 
considering the applicable waste management regulations. This approach of Reusing, Reducing and Recycling not only 
promotes the principles of sustainability but also supports the circular economy.
