INDUSTRY TAILWINDS
High-End Hopes of Luxury 
India’s luxury market is poised for significant growth, driven by the rising middle-class 
population and the country’s status as the fastest-growing large economy. Indians are 
increasingly willing to invest in travel comfort, opting for business or first-class upgrades, 
selecting premium seats, and accessing airport lounges.  Indian interest in international 
trips is surging, with travel searches increasing by 225% since 2019, outpacing other 
Asia-Pacific countries. This indicates a strong demand for luxury travel.
Destinations worldwide, including Saudi Arabia, San Francisco, Switzerland, and 
Singapore, target Indian luxury travelers. Saudi Arabia, for example, welcomed over 
1 million Indian visitors in 2022 and aims to increase this to over 7 million by 2030, making 
India its top source market.
Business Travel Surge 
Corporate travel demands are rising, pushing the need for advanced technology. Businesses 
now seek modern expense management solutions with intuitive interfaces, mobile apps, 
and automated processes to streamline reporting and enhance the travel experience. 
In-person interactions remain crucial for achieving business goals.
Credit Cards in Circulation & Spending 
The adoption and usage of credit cards in India are surging, driven by Buy Now Pay Later 
(BNPL) services and Financial Technology (FinTech) innovations such as digital wallets and 
contactless payments. Collaborations between banks and FinTech companies are enhancing 
this growth. Offering attractive rewards and cashback incentives further encourages credit 
card usage. Additionally, the economic rebound is boosting consumer spending.
Disposable Income & Rising Middle Class 
India is poised to become the fourth-largest global spender on travel by 2030, driven by 
the increasing purchasing power of its middle class. Government initiatives, substantial 
infrastructure development, and rich cultural attractions boost tourism appeal. 
Additionally, India's youthful demographic, with a median age of 28.2 years, will make 
the country an irresistible destination for global tourism players.

Message from the 
Chairperson and 
Managing Director
Management Message
Dear Shareholders, 
As we continue to work towards 
DreamFolks' mission, we aim to 
offer everyone high-quality travel 
and lifestyle experiences and 
become a preferred service provider. 
This year, we continued to expand 
our service offerings by leveraging 
our advanced technology and 
valuable client relationships.  
We are strengthening our leadership 
in airport services and increasing 
our brand recognition through 
strategic global partnerships. This 
strategy reinforces our commitment 
to expanding the range and 
accessibility of our services, 
ensuring that DreamFolks remains 
at the forefront of innovation in 
the travel industry.
World, India, and Aviation Industry
In FY2023-24, the global economy displayed robust 
growth, marked by a significant 3.2% expansion, reflecting 
resilience 
and 
adaptability 
in 
economic 
practices 
worldwide. India particularly shone, with its GDP touching 
8.2% p.a., significantly outperforming predictions and 
setting a positive economic narrative that continued into 
the aviation sector. The sector rebounded impressively, 
with passenger traffic surging by 36.9% year-over-year, 
catapulting beyond pre-pandemic levels. The aviation 
industry is expected to continue its growth momentum, 
supported by rising global travel interest, increased 
aircraft  deliveries, and the growing demand for luxury 
travel experiences.
This upward trend is supported by substantial investments 
in aviation infrastructure, particularly in the Asia Pacific 
region, which is poised to become the fastest-growing 
aviation market globally. With India's domestic air 
passenger traffic surging by 13% to 153.7 million in FY2024, 
the nation is on track to secure its position as the world's 
third-largest aviation market by 2025, driven by increased 
leisure and business travel. This trajectory is a testament 
to the industry's resilience and underscores the strategic 
insights that continue to propel DreamFolks forward in 
these thriving times. Furthermore, the expanding lounge 
areas, up by 7,000 square meters in FY2024 alone, highlight 
the lucrative potential of this niche within the broader 
aviation industry.
Credit card industry in India 
has witnessed significant growth
The credit card industry in India has witnessed significant 
growth and evolution in recent years, fueled by increasing 
consumer spending, digitalization, and expanding financial 
inclusion initiatives.
Data from RBI indicates that the number of credit cards in 
circulation as on the end of last financial year has increased 
by 19% YoY to reach 101.8 million cards outstanding. 
Another metric showcasing the increasing adoption of 
credit cards, is the noticeable increase in the average spend 
per credit card during the year, to about INR 1.80 lakh in 
FY2024, from INR 1.68 lakh in FY2023, an increase of about 
7% YoY.
Both these facts clearly signal the leading adoption of credit 
cards in the country, which would certainly provide us with 
the necessary tailwinds to ensure a sustained growth in 
the business.

Diverse Dimensions, Superior Experiences
We emphasize our commitment to expanding and 
enriching the travel and lifestyle services we offer at 
DreamFolks. This theme reflects our strategic approach 
to integrating a wider range of services, catering to our 
global clientele's varied needs and aspirations. Our focus 
remains on aggregation and integration of new services 
to our portfolio and ensuring unparalleled quality across 
all interactions, ensuring that every experience with 
DreamFolks meets and exceeds the expectations of those 
we serve. We have added various services throughout the 
year like providing access to luxury services, car rental 
services, salon services, and many more.
In addition to integrating new contemporary services, we 
have broadened our aggregation efforts in lounge services 
as well, and are now facilitating access of lounges not only 
at the airport but also at the railway stations, highways, 
and visa application centres for which we have tied up 
with Visa Services, the largest visa outsourcing service 
provider globally.
At DreamFolks, we are 
committed to redefining the 
travel and lifestyle sector 
and being a one-stop solution 
for all lifestyle services, 
by diversifying our service 
portfolio and strengthening 
our global presence.
 
As we look to the future, 
DreamFolks is poised to 
seize the vast opportunities 
ahead. Our strategy is clear: 
to continue expanding our 
global footprint, diversifying 
our service offerings and the 
categories of clients, reaching 
new markets, and enhancing 
our clients’ travel and 
lifestyle experiences. 
Financial Performance
In FY2024, DreamFolks achieved remarkable financial 
growth, with revenue increasing to INR 11,350 million, a 
47% rise from INR 7,733 million in FY2023, significantly 
outpacing the domestic air traffic growth of 13%. This year's 
performance underscores our leadership in the lounge 
services aggregation industry, with a revenue CAGR of 
100% from FY2022 to FY2024. We facilitated approximately 
11 million passengers in FY2024 which was 3.5 million in 
FY2022, leveraging digital advancements like web access 
and self-check-in kiosks, which now accounts for ~10% of 
our monthly passenger interactions. Our gross margins 
remained within guidance at 12.1%, and our adjusted 
EBITDA reached INR 1,033 million, with a margin of 9.1%. 
Additionally, revenues from services beyond Indian airport 
lounges grew to 6%, from less than 2% in FY2022, owing 
to our focus on diversifying our business model, with a 
strategic vision to expand these contributions to 15-20% 
over the next 4-5 years.
Strategic Achievements
At DreamFolks, we are committed to redefining the travel 
and lifestyle sector and being a one-stop solution for all 
lifestyle services, by diversifying our service portfolio and 
strengthening our global presence. We forged important 
alliances with RedBeryl and Eco Mobility, broadening our 
luxury lifestyle services and introducing luxury car rentals 
for the end consumers. Further enriching our offerings, 
we entered the beauty and grooming space through a new 
partnership with Looks Salon, and others like Matrix for 
E-sim and MyFlowerTree for gifting services.
Our strategic expansion continued by integrating over 340 
Plaza Premium lounges across more than 70 major airports 
worldwide, enhancing our network's global reach. Our entry 
into the Malaysian market was a significant development, 
leveraging our proprietary technology to manage lounge 
benefits effectively. These efforts are complemented by our 
expansions into high-growth regions in CEMEA (Central 
Europe, Middle East & Africa) and Southeast Asia, 
fueled by our robust technological framework and solid 
client relationships.
Our new go-to-market strategy involves partnerships 
with OTAs, airlines, and enterprises. This strategic pivot is 
designed to broaden our market reach and increase the 
brand equity of DreamFolks among different set of clients.
These initiatives would allow us to scale operations, improve 
profit margins, and capture growth opportunities presented 
by increasing travel demand, the rising adoption of digital 
payments, and a growing preference for premium services. 
DreamFolks is poised to maintain its leadership and deliver 
build up value to travelers worldwide by continuously 
innovating and adapting to the industry's dynamic needs.
Technology and Innovation
Our technology platform is crucial to operational success, 
enhancing 
service 
and 
ensuring 
efficient 
delivery. 
Developed in-house, the proprietary platform is the 
backbone of our bespoke product offerings, enabling 
tailored solutions that cater uniquely to client needs. 
Our 
asset-light, 
cloud-based 
infrastructure 
ensures 
that clients and consumers have transparent access to 
services and benefits, facilitated by a robust omnichannel 
approach—including mobile apps, self-check-in kiosks, and 
web portals.
This technology improves customer engagement through 
specific value propositions and reduces our clients' total 
cost of ownership. Our ongoing investment in technology 
innovation ensures DreamFolks remains a leader in the 
travel and lifestyle sectors.
Sustainability and Community Engagement
DreamFolks is committed to integrating sustainability and 
community engagement into its core business practices, 
focusing on societal and environmental benefits. For 
over a decade, initiatives such as Project AKSHAR have 
driven educational support by improving infrastructure 
in underprivileged schools. In the fiscal year 2023-2024, 
efforts were particularly directed towards enhancing 
educational facilities for girls in Haryana, supporting our 
goals of female empowerment and community upliftment, 
and reinforcing our impact on sustainable development.
Future Outlook and Closing Remarks
As we look to the future, DreamFolks is poised to seize 
the vast opportunities ahead. Our strategy is clear: to 
continue expanding our global footprint, diversifying our 
service offerings and the categories of clients, reaching 
new markets, and enhancing our clients' travel and 
lifestyle experiences. We are committed to harnessing 
cutting-edge technology and innovation to stay at the 
forefront of the industry, ensuring that we meet but 
exceed the expectations of our clients and shareholders. 
Positive industry tailwinds, such as increase in demand for 
travel, rising adoption of credit cards and digital payment 
solutions and growing demand for premium services such 
as lounges and other lifestyle services present significant 
growth prospects in the foreseeable future. Thank you 
for your continued trust and support as we journey into 
another promising year with a vision to make every travel

Six Questions for 
Balaji Srinivasan 
Director and CTO, DreamFolks
Q: Can you describe DreamFolks’ unified 
technology platform and its capabilities?
DreamFolks tech platform has fundamentally transformed 
the industry, addressing critical pain points for our 
clients. Traditionally, banks & other clients struggled to 
provide their customers with seamless access to travel & 
lifestyle benefits, facing challenges in integration and real-
time benefit management. DreamFolks’ technology has 
resolved these issues by integrating directly into banks’ / 
clients’ systems, allowing for effortless management and 
tracking of services availed, thus enhancing the overall 
customer experience. 
This integration ensures that details such as the benefits for 
each product variant, the benefits availed by consumers, 
and the accounting pertaining to use of the lounge & other 
services by consumers are maintained and monitored 
through DreamFolks. In other words, DreamFolks helps to 
address the front-end i.e., validating and providing access 
to lounges & other services as well as the back end in terms 
of maintaining the benefits and utilization of usage for end-
consumers of the lounges. 
In terms of tech prowess, we are typically 2-3 years ahead of 
the market, anticipating industry transitions well in advance 
and upgrading our tech solution as per our clients’ needs.
Q: What problems does DreamFolks solve 
for its clients? 
DreamFolks is the key enabler for top Indian banks, helping 
them address P&L issues related to their credit and debit 
card products. Banks were under pressure due to the 
increased costs of offering benefits like airport lounges and 
other travel perks. To alleviate this, DreamFolks launched 
an industry-first spend-based solution on its tech platform 
about three years ago, which has now been adopted by 
most of its clients. 
Our tech solution allows banks to link card benefits to spend-
based or usage-based models, offering benefits to ‘right’ 
customers and tying them to key performance indicators 
(KPIs) such as spending, transactions, user profitability, 
active status, etc. Additionally, DreamFolks’ technology 
helps reduce benefit abuse by customers who acquire cards 
solely for complimentary perks. 
The platform enables banks to create virtual logical tiers 
within the same card product, offering different benefits to 
cardholders based on these tiers, thereby allowing banks 
to shift from a fixed-cost to a variable-cost model. Today, 
Banks and Financial Institutions are standardizing our tech 
solution which is scalable for the future.
Q: How does DreamFolks improve the 
experience for end-consumers?
There is a growing demand among travellers for 
differentiated services and seamless experiences. In 
addition to offering traditional modes of service access via 
credit/debit cards, DreamFolks is the only company that 
provides customers with hybrid modes of access to lounges 
& other services. DreamFolks has launched one-of-its kind 
industry solutions to enhance the customers airport travel 
experience – like QR enabled web access and self-check in 
kiosks to skip the queue at lounges. 
Web-access platform: Enables end-users to add multiple 
cards and check their benefits/usage, purchase additional 
visits, and get digital access via QR code generation. 
Self check-in kiosks for lounge access: DreamFolks has 
deployed self-serve kiosks at high traffic airports for users 
to check their benefits on their bank cards, and get a QR for 
digital access to a lounge. This helps utilize the full capacity of 
lounges, reduces the waiting time to gain access & improves 
passenger experience for smooth lounge check-in.
Broadened array of services: Makes customers spoilt for 
choice. Services are not just limited to air travel, but also 
access to railway lounges and lifestyle services like golf, 
beauty & grooming, healthcare, travel SIM, and more.
Q: How is technology transforming the 
airport service sector?
As air passenger traffic in India is expected to reach a 
record high in the range of 408 to 417 million passengers by 
FY2025, the role of technology becomes crucial in enhancing 
travel experience. 
DreamFolks instigated a paradigm shift in the landscape of 
airport & travel services, leveraging its technology as a core 
unique selling proposition. The once-exclusive premium 
services which were accessible to only business class 
passengers/frequent flyers have now become accessible to 
everyone, revolutionizing the overall airport experience. 
Financial institutions, in turn, have found avenues to 
reinforce customer engagement and loyalty by offering 
these value-added services which are not only limited to 
lounge access but also include aspirational services covering 
the entire traveller journey such as Meet & Assist, Airport 
Transfers, Airport Spa, Transit Hotels/Nap Rooms, Visa at 
Your Doorstep, Duty Free, and more. 
DreamFolks’ commitment to continuous tech advancement 
and client-centric innovation re- strengthens its mission to 
disrupt the industry with innovative tech solutions.
Q: Can you discuss the capabilities and 
features of DreamFolks’ new web access 
product for lounge services?
DreamFolks’ web access platform is a significant addition 
to our suite of service access modes. . This platform lets 
consumers register their bank cards and view the benefits 
available on their cards in real-time. Users can monitor 
card utilization, generate QR codes for lounge access, 
and purchase additional visits. Notably, the platform 
also supports a paid model for gaining service access 
for additional guests. This in-house developed solution 
simplifies the access  and management of benefits, thereby 
enhancing end-user convenience.
Q: How does DreamFolks integrate new 
partnerships and offerings to enhance 
customer benefits?
DreamFolks utilizes its proprietary technology platform 
to seamlessly integrate new services, such as those from 
RedBeryl and Eco Mobility, enhancing user benefits. 
DreamFolks offers the benefits to all clients on the same 
platform, with full access to the access modes, tiers 
technology, and spend based solutions.
This enables DreamFolks’ clients to offer targeted products 
and solutions, optimizing the value proposition for end 
consumers and maintaining a competitive advantage in 
the market.
Our tech remains one of our most vital assets and thus reflects our commitment to 
continuously upgrading the platform. This is rooted in our pursuit of providing future 
forward solutions that solve targeted industry problems and needs of our clientsm and 
continue to disrupt the industry.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
GLOBAL ECONOMY
Overview 
The global economy’s post-pandemic journey has been 
resilient. As the world avoided a recession, the banking 
system proved its robustness and emerging markets did 
not suffer sudden stops, translating into a global growth 
of 3.2% during CY2023 as compared to 3.5% in 2022. 
Advanced economies played a key role in sustaining global 
resilience by growing at 1.6% in CY2023. Given the backdrop 
of significant monetary tightening, these economies thrived 
on steady employment growth and a resurgence in consumer 
confidence, which proved crucial in supporting their stability. 
In the United States, growth surpassed pre-pandemic levels. 
In emerging market economies, decisive monetary policy 
actions and enhanced monetary policy frameworks have 
effectively anchored inflation expectations. These measures 
have been instrumental in enhancing economic stability, 
increasing confidence, and facilitating continuous growth 
amid global uncertainties. Consequently, Emerging Market 
and Developing Economies (EMDEs) grew by 4.3% as 
compared to 4.0% witnessed in CY2022.1

Source: IMF World Economic Outlook3, *calendar year
The global economic strength was supported by robust 
economic activity and the ability to adapt to changing financial 
conditions. Despite higher interest rates implemented by 
central banks, households in major developed countries 
actively utilized their accumulated pandemic savings, 
contributing unexpectedly to the economic momentum in 
those regions. Stability was reflected in steady job growth 
and rising incomes, strong consumer demand, increased 
government spending, and higher labour force participation. 
The growth in global services sector is outpacing the 
growth in manufacturing sector as depicted by the J.P. 
Morgan Global Composite PMI Output Index, with service 
sector business activity rising for the 11th successive month 
in December 2023.2 
Moreover, Global inflation has been settling, helped 
by easing supply-chain frictions and declining Chinese 
export prices coupled with central banks’ policy easing. 
The global inflation has come down to 6.8% in CY2023, from 
8.7% in CY2022.3 
Outlook
According to International Monetary Fund (IMF) projections, 
global growth for CY2024F and CY2025F will hold steady at 
around 3.2%, the same as CY2023.The advanced economies 
are expected to bounce back due to balanced growth from 
US, overcoming recession by Euro Area countries and 
improvement in growth of other advanced economies, 
offsetting the decline in growth rate of Japanese economy. 
Thus, the advanced economies are expected to grow by 
1.7% and 1.8% in CY2024F and CY2025F, respectively, from 
1.6% in CY2023. 
However, the EMDEs growth is expected to slow down from 
4.3% in CY2023 to 4.2% each in CY2024F and CY2025F. 
The troubled Chinese property sector growth is expected to 
decline from 5.2% in CY2023 to 4.6% and 4.1% for CY2024F 
and CY2025F, respectively, and poses significant threat to 
the trading partners. Moreover, The global headline inflation 
is expected to decline to 5.9% in CY2024F and further 4.5% 
in CY2025F enabled by cooling of advanced economies 
faster than the EMDEs.3

Inflation vis-à-vis Real GDP growth YoY trend (2000-2029F)
INDIAN ECONOMY
Overview 
The Indian economy demonstrated robust growth, driven 
by vigorous demand and buoyant investment, amid 
optimistic business and consumer sentiments. In FY2024, 
economic conditions were shaped by a sluggish global 
recovery, moderated inflation, and declining commodity 
prices, particularly in crude oil. Supportive policies have 
enhanced growth and investment inflows. Key indicators, 
such as high manufacturing capacity utilization, substantial 
government capital expenditure, and strong FDI inflows, 
reflected investment dynamism.
As per the Provisional Estimates released by the National 
Statistical Office (NSO) in May 2024, Real Gross Domestic 
Product (GDP) growth for FY2024 is estimated at 8.2% 
as compared to 7.0% in FY2023. However, the final 
consumption, i.e., per capita Private Final Consumption 
Expenditure, during FY2024 grew at a slower pace by 
7.6% as compared to 13.0% during FY2023. The real Gross 
Value Added (GVA) recorded a growth of 7.2% in FY2024 
representing increase from 6.7% in FY2023. The financial, 
real estate, and professional services sectors grew by 
8.4%. The trade, hotels, transport, communication, and 
broadcasting services grew by 6.4% during FY2024.4,5
India’s services exports grew by 4.4% during FY2024 to 
record USD 339.6 billion from USD 325.3 billion in FY2023, 
while as of May 2024, the services exports are estimated 
to grow by robust 14.6% during April-May 2024 over 
April-May 2023 period.6,7 
Further, the country’s external balance sheet remains 
strong, characterized by a moderate current account deficit, 
robust capital flows, and increasing foreign exchange 
reserves. India’s foreign exchange reserves reached to USD 
645.6 billion as of March 31, 2024, representing an increase 
of USD 67.1 billion over reserves as on March 31, 2023, and 
has now reached USD 655.8 billion as of June 7, 2024, with 
an increase of USD 4.3 billion over the previous week. This is 
expected to safeguard the domestic economic activity from 
global volatility and their central bank’s monetary policies. 
The acceleration in economic growth often influences 
inflationary pressures, impacting price levels across various 
sectors of the economy. In India, inflation is influenced by 
several factors, including fluctuations in food and fuel prices, 
as well as global economic conditions. A rise in the repo rate 
increases borrowing costs, reducing the money supply and 
aiding in inflation control. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) 
headline inflation softened to 5.4% for FY2024 down from 
6.7% in FY2023. 4,8 
As per RBI sample households survey, although private 
consumption lags behind Gross Fixed Capital Formation 
and exports compared to 2019-20 levels, urban consumer 
confidence has improved in terms of economic conditions, 
employment, and income. Declining unemployment and 
steady bank credit growth further highlight favourable 
economic conditions.4
In the business landscape, the rise of digital platforms 
and e-commerce has provided entrepreneurs with new 
opportunities and streamlined global trade. In India, the 
adoption 
of 
technology-driven 
solutions, 
particularly 
innovative digital payment methods like the Unified Payments 
Interface (UPI), has significantly propelled e-commerce 
growth. Digital payment transactions have experienced 
remarkable expansion, with the volume soaring from 20.71 
billion in FY2018 to 134.62 billion in FY2023, demonstrating 
a robust Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 45.0%. 
As of December 11, 2023, digital payment transactions for 
FY2024 have already surpassed 1.17 billion, indicating the 
sustained momentum in digital payment adoption, and 
creating opportunities for businesses to cross-sell products 
and attract new customers.

Outlook
The high-frequency indicators of domestic activity indicate 
strong performance in FY2025E. A sustained momentum 
in manufacturing and services sector, coupled with an 
above-normal southwest monsoon which bodes well for 
agriculture and rural demand, are expected to revive 
private consumption. High capacity-utilization in the 
manufacturing sector, combined with healthy balance 
sheets of banks and corporations, underscores the stability 
of investment activity. The government's continued focus 
on infrastructure spending and the prevailing optimism in 
business sentiments further fortify this outlook. 
Despite headwinds from geopolitical tensions, volatility 
in international commodity prices, and geo-economic 
fragmentation, the prospects of improving global trade 
could promote external demand. Real GDP growth for 
FY2025F is projected at 7.2%, as against 8.2% in FY2024P. 
While headline inflation is gradually easing, adverse 
climate events introduce uncertainty to the trajectory of 
food inflation. Additionally, volatility in crude oil prices, 
fluctuations in financial markets, and the tightening of 
non-energy commodity prices pose upside risks to inflation. 
Considering these factors, CPI inflation for FY2025F is 
projected at 4.5% compared to 5.4% achieved in FY2024.9

Global RPKs Growth by Market
GLOBAL AVIATION INDUSTRY
Overview
The year 2023 marks the comeback of airline industry 
with strong air travel demand, after four years of pressure 
on the passenger growth, as a result of pandemic shock. 
According to International Air Transport Association (IATA), 
the total passenger traffic which is measured by Revenue 
Passenger Kilometres (RPKs), grew by 36.9% in CY2023 
over CY2022 and was 94.1% of pre-pandemic CY2019 
levels. In CY2023, the passenger carrying capacity, which 
is measured by Available Seat Kilometres (ASKs), grew by 
24.1% over CY2022, which was 94.4% of pre-pandemic 
CY2019 levels.11
The global domestic airline traffic (RPKs) in CY2023 has 
surpassed CY2019 peak by 3.6% and rose by 30.2% over 
CY2022. The world’s three largest domestic passenger 
markets, viz, China, the United States, and India contributed 
most of the industry performance growth in CY2023, 
growing by 138.8%, 9.4% and 22.4%, YoY respectively. 
While the three markets had exceeded CY2019 peak RPKs by 
7.1%, 3.2% , and 5.3%, respectively. Japan and Australia were 
the only two markets lagging 2019 peak RPKs though shown 
significant YoY growth of 30.7% and 14.8% in CY2023.10

Domestic RPKs Growth by Market
International RPKs Growth by Market
Whereas the international RPKs saw remarkable growth in 
CY2023 of 41.4% YoY, reflecting strong results for all the 
regions. However, they are still 11.5% short of CY2019 levels. 
While all the major markets grew by average 30.0%, Asia 
Pacific grew significantly by 126.1% over CY2022, but also 
had a largest shortfall vis-à-vis CY2019 by 27.4%.10
During CY2023, most governments through the International 
Civil 
Aviation 
Organization 
unveiled 
five 
roadmaps 
addressing aircraft technology, energy infrastructure, 
operations, finance and major being policy consideration 
of setting a target of 5.0% reduction in carbon dioxide 
emissions through Sustainable Aviation Fuels to achieve net 
zero carbon emissions by CY2050F.12
As per IATA, during CY2023, despite high crude oil prices, 
strong USD against many other currencies, and constant 
inflation throughout the world, the aviation industry 
has adapted to the changing environment and reported 
revenues more than CY2019 levels with operating profits 
rebounded to CY2018 levels. IATA expects operating margin 
to increase to 5.7% and net profits to clock USD 27.4 billion 
in CY2023F.10

Airline Industry EBIT Margin and Net Profit Trend
Outlook
As per IATA, most regions are expected to surpass CY2019 
levels in 2024F with Asia Pacific’s connectivity is expected to 
be fully restored. The region’s total passengers are expected 
to significantly increase by 17.2% in CY2024F, mostly by 
China and India, while other regions could see a growth in 
the range of 6.0%-10.0% in CY2024F. Africa would be the only 
market which is expected to see contraction in passenger 
numbers by 1.6% in CY2024F. The world passenger numbers 
are expected to increase by 10.4% in CY2024F.
The study expects in over 20 years by CY2043F, the world 
passengers to increase by CAGR of 3.8% p.a., resulting in 
more than 4 billion additional passenger journeys over 
CY2023. Though the European and North American markets 
would see slow CAGR by 2.3% p.a. and 2.7% p.a., respectively, 
Asia Pacific region is forecasted to report the fastest CAGR 
of 5.3% and contributing more than half of the net increase 
in global passengers by CY2043F.10

Aircraft Deliveries Trend
Despite slower growth in the air traffic in CY2024F, the 
Operating margin is expected to climb to 6.0% and net profit 
to reach USD 30.5 billion, driven by the increasing fleet 
utilization, favorable load factors, and sustained demand.10
In response to strong passenger and cargo demand, airlines 
are seeking quieter and more fuel-efficient equipment and 
placing large orders for new commercial jets, resulting in 
aircraft deliveries in CY2023 to surge by 11.3% over CY2022 
to reach 1,378 aircrafts.
Despite being downwardly revised by 8.4%, the industry 
forecasts 1,583 scheduled deliveries in CY2024F, which is 
still the highest number of aircraft scheduled to be delivered 
since CY2018. Furthermore, the industry is expected to 
receive 2,293 aircrafts by CY2025F.10
Additionally, the total deliveries of aircrafts between CY2024 
to CY2030E, is expected to be more than 12,800, which 
was 8,100+ between CY2017 to CY2023, as per Mordor 
Intelligence reports. 
Airline Ancillary Services Market
As per Global Insight Services, the global airline ancillary 
services market, which was valued at USD 100.5 billion 
in CY2022, is expected to grow up to USD 481.3 billion by 
CY2032F, with a CAGR of 17.0% during the period.14
Rising aspirations of passengers seeking a premium 
experience, are set to substantially enhance the global 
lounge industry in the foreseeable future. The global lounge 
industry is expected to experience a CAGR of 7.5% from 
CY2023 to CY2033F, according to the Spherical Insights 
Report from January 2024. As per the Mordor Intelligence 
Report, the airport lounge market which is valued at USD 
4.2 billion by CY2024 is expected to grow at a much faster 
rate of CAGR 17.5% until CY2029F to reach USD 9.4 billion.15 
Globally, the Asia-Pacific region is anticipated to be the 
fastest-growing market, driven by a significant surge in air 
traffic and substantial investments in aviation infrastructure. 
Lounges continue to generate high margins for airport 
operators, prompting greater allocation of space. In FY2024, 
we witnessed a notable expansion of lounge areas by 7,000 
square meters across all airports.
Airline ancillary services include revenue streams distinct 
from ticket sales, including offerings such as foods & 
beverages, baggage check-ins, premium seats, early 
boarding privileges, and other features. Additionally, 
commission-based products such as non-transportation 
related services such as airport transfers, hotel and cab 
reservations, trip insurance, inflight entertainment, and 
advertising, are often facilitated through collaborations with 
online travel agencies.
These ancillary revenues enable airlines to upsell premium 
seating options (e.g., aisle seats) or bundle the primary 
product (airline ticket) with additional services like meals. 
Such strategies enhance revenue by meeting customer 
expectations 
and 
enriching 
the 
travel 
experience. 
Frequent flyers can earn rewards and loyalty bonuses 
through co-branded credit cards and mile accelerator 
programs based on their travel frequency. Globally, airlines 
prioritize ancillary products and services as a critical 
revenue source and efforts are underway to develop

INDIAN AVIATION INDUSTRY
Overview 
The continuous enhancement of aviation infrastructure, 
coupled with strategic policy interventions, has elevated 
India's status as a rapidly growing global aviation hub. 
CY2023 witnessed numerous significant developments 
and achievements in the Indian aviation sector, reflecting 
its resilience and adaptability amidst global challenges. 
Despite the ongoing complexities introduced by the global 
pandemic, Indian airlines have successfully navigated these 
obstacles, gradually recovering and adapting to the evolving 
travel landscape. This period saw the introduction of new 
routes and expansion of services, enhancing connectivity 
both domestically and internationally. 
On November 19, 2023, India marked a significant milestone 
in its aviation sector as domestic airlines transported 
a record-breaking 456,910 passengers in a single day. 
This achievement represents the highest daily air traffic since 
the onset of the pandemic, showcasing a remarkable 7.4% 
increase compared to pre-COVID averages. As per DGCA 
data, FY2024 has witnessed a 13.0% increase in passengers 
travelled, reaching 153.7 million from 136.0 million in 
FY2023. This surge in passenger numbers underscores 
the recovery and resilience of the aviation industry and 
will lead India to become the world’s third-largest aviation 
market by FY2025F.16
As per Government of India (GoI) data, the number of 
operational airports has surged from a modest 74 in 2014 to 
an impressive 148 by 202317, effectively doubling the nation's 
aviation infrastructure. This substantial augmentation 
is indicative of the government's resolute and strategic 
endeavours to enhance aviation facilities and infrastructure, 
which are pivotal to the sector's evolution.
Central to this transformative journey is the Regional 
Connectivity Scheme – Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik (RCS-UDAN), 
an innovative initiative launched in 2016. On the basis of five 
rounds of bidding, 517 routes have commenced operations 
connecting 76 airports, including 9 Heliports and 2 Water 
Aerodrome.  More than 130 city pairs have been created 
and around 2.47 lakh flights have operated under the UDAN 
scheme so far, carrying over 130 lakh passengers.18 During 
CY2023, 60 new routes under the Regional Connectivity 
Scheme (RCS) were introduced16. In the northeastern states, 
12 new RCS routes were launched. Furthermore, 154 new 
RCS routes were awarded under UDAN 4.2 and 5.0.16 
Significant progress was made in airport infrastructure 
development and modernization projects across the 
country. The Greenfield Airports Policy, introduced by 
the GoI in 2008, outlines guidelines, procedures, and 
conditions for establishing new Greenfield airports in the 
country. Under this policy, the government has granted 
'in-principle' approval for the development of 21 Greenfield 
airports nationwide. Among these, 12 airports have 
become operational. Notably, in CY2023, three Greenfield 
airports, namely Mopa in Goa, Shivamogga in Karnataka, 
and Rajkot in Gujarat, commenced operations, significantly 
contributing to the growth and connectivity of India's 
aviation infrastructure.16
This ambitious scheme has successfully democratised 
air travel, rendering it more accessible and affordable for 
millions of Indians. The scheme has not only facilitated 
greater regional connectivity but also has stimulated 
ancillary industries, thereby creating a ripple effect of 
economic prosperity. Moreover, the augmentation of airport 
infrastructure has catalysed the growth of the tourism 
sector, attracting both domestic and international tourists 
and thereby promoting the country's economic fabric. 
Additionally, the sector integrated advanced technologies 
to streamline operations, improve passenger experiences, 
and ensure safety. There was also a notable adoption 
of sustainable aviation practices, including the use of 
fuel-efficient technologies and eco-friendly initiatives. At the 
Paris Air Show, held in June 2023, IndiGo finalized a landmark 
order for 500 Airbus A320 family aircraft and the following 
day, Air India sealed a deal for 470 aircraft from Airbus and 
Boeing, further emphasizing the sector's robust growth.16
Outlook
As per Mordor Intelligence, the Indian aviation market 
size is expected to grow from USD 13.9 billion in CY2024 
to USD 26.1 billion in CY2030F at a CAGR of 11.1% p.a.

Annual Report 2023-24
According to Boeing’s 2023 Commercial Market Outlook, 
the South Asian region is expected to become the 
fastest-growing commercial aviation market with more than 
8.1% annual passenger traffic growth by 2042F. The South 
Asian carriers are expected to quadruple the size of fleets by 
more than 2,700 new aircrafts to meet the rising passenger 
and cargo growth. Of this, roughly 72.0% will be new 
additions to fleet while remaining will be replacement with 
fuel-efficient models and about 2,320 aircraft will be single 
aisle and 380 would be widebody.20
India, being one of the strongest economies in the region, 
is supported by its fastest-growing middle class travellers, 
which will drive the regional air travel in the region. 
India’s low-cost carriers extensively connect the emerging 
regions with low fares garnering to approximately 90% of all 
domestic and international seats in the South Asian market.20
India’s domestic market, in terms of traffic and capacity, 
has now fully recovered from pandemic and have exceeded 
CY2019 levels by 9.0% and 11.0%, respectively. The financial 
investment in Indian carriers and their subsequent fleet 
orders have boosted confidence in future passenger 
traffic growth. With the highest global population of 1.4 
billion and median age of 29 years, India’s demographics 
are well-positioned tailwinds to support the economy for 
decades. The rapid pace of recovery and economic activity 
in the region further extends the non-stop connectivity to 
North America, Europe, East Asia, and Oceania markets, 
marking the growth from CY2019 levels.20
According to CAPA India, as Indian airlines receive deliveries 
from their extensive order of approximately 1,500 aircraft, 
it is projected that Indian carriers will deploy an additional 
325-350 aircraft on international routes over the next 5-7 
years. This influx will introduce unprecedented choices 
for Indian consumers, who will have the option of flying 
with world-class Indian full-service carriers (FSCs), low-cost 
carriers (LCCs), and leading global airlines. Consequently, 
the dynamics of international travel from India are evolving 
to resemble those of domestic travel, prompting the notion 
that “international is suddenly the new domestic.”21
The volume of international outbound departures by Indian 
residents is anticipated to soar from 17.4 million in CY2019 to 
over 50 million by CY2030F. This surge reflects a burgeoning 
interest in international leisure travel, which is expected 
to grow from 8.3 million trips to over 28 million during the 
same period. In tandem with this growth, expenditure on 
holidays including both air travel and ground arrangements 
is forecasted to escalate dramatically, increasing from 
USD 16-18 billion in CY2019 to USD 65-75 billion in CY30F. 
Additionally, by CY2030F, it is projected that air travel will 
constitute just over 20.0% of total leisure spending.21
This robust growth in international travel is driven by 
several factors. Indian travellers are increasingly seeking 
longer-duration holidays, with a significant shift in 
preferences among younger travellers who desire more 
immersive and engaging experiences. These travellers are 
looking for itineraries that feature events, activities, and 
adventures, rather than trips cantered solely on relaxation 
and unwinding. 
The ongoing expansion of international flight options, 
combined with evolving travel preferences and increasing 
disposable incomes, positions Indian travellers as a major 
force in the global tourism market. This transformation 
is expected to reshape the landscape of international 
travel, underscoring the growing influence of Indian 
tourists worldwide.
GoI further plans to increase the number of operational 
airports from 148 to over 200 by FY2030F. The Indian 
aviation industry is poised to elevate its domestic traffic 
to 300 million passengers by 2030F, a substantial increase 
from 60 million in 2014 and 153 million passengers in 2024. 
This ambitious target reflects a significant investment in the 
sector, highlighting a strong commitment to enhancing the 
aviation infrastructure and services within the country.22
Furthermore, the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) has been 
allocated a substantial budget of INR 30 billion for FY2025. 
This financial backing reflect the government's robust 
support and dedication to the successful execution of these 
expansive projects.23
As part of this modernization, the airline ancillary industry 
is also expected to witness significant growth. With airlines 
continually striving to enhance passenger experiences 
and generate additional revenue, the demand for ancillary 
services is set to rise. Factors such as increasing urbanization, 
the need for convenience and personalization, and higher 
private consumption are driving this demand. The industry 
is poised to benefit from a growing trend towards 
personalized services, with airlines offering customized 
experiences based on individual passenger preferences.
Airport lounges, as a key component of the ancillary services 
landscape, are set to become even more integral to the 
passenger experience. These lounges provide a tranquil and 
luxurious environment, allowing travellers to relax, work,

HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY
Overview 
The global hospitality industry witnessed a robust recovery in 
CY2023, spurred by the gradual easing of travel restrictions 
and a surge in travel demand. According to the United 
Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), international 
tourism ended CY2023 at 88.0% of pre-pandemic levels, 
with an estimated 1.3 billion international arrivals with a 
remarkable growth of 41.8% over CY2022 arrivals of 917 
million passengers. The Middle East led recovery in relative 
terms as the only region to overcome pre-pandemic levels 
with arrivals 22.0% above CY2019. The world’s largest 
destination region, Europe reached 94.0% of CY2019 
levels supported by intra-regional demand and travel 
from Americas. The Americas reached 90.0% while Africa 
recovered 96.0% of pre-pandemic visitors. The International 
tourism revenues reached USD 1.4 trillion in CY2023, which 
stood about 93% of the USD 1.5 trillion earned in the 
pre-pandemic CY2019.24
This resurgence in international travel is transforming the 
global hospitality landscape. Hotels, resorts, and other 
accommodation providers are experiencing increased 
occupancy rates, driving revenue growth and encouraging 
further investment in the sector. The recovery is also 
imparting innovation, with hospitality businesses adopting 
advanced technologies to enhance guest experiences and 
ensure safety.
In addition to increased leisure travel, the hospitality 
industry is witnessing a resurgence in business travel and 
MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences, and exhibitions) 
tourism. This trend is critical for the full recovery of the 
sector, as business travel typically generates higher revenue 
per guest and supports a wide range of ancillary services.
or refresh before their flights. With the modernization of 
airports and the introduction of new aircraft, the demand 
for premium lounge services is expected to rise, catering to 
the needs of both business and leisure travellers seeking 
exclusive amenities.
With the right strategies and initiatives, the industry is 
well-positioned to capitalize on emerging opportunities and

INDIAN HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY
Overview
The Indian hospitality industry has exhibited remarkable 
resilience by adeptly navigating through periods of volatility 
and economic uncertainty. By adopting leaner and more 
efficient cost structures, major hotel chains and hospitality 
companies have not only achieved higher profitability 
but also significantly strengthened their balance sheets. 
This strategic fiscal prudence has enabled these entities 
to better withstand market fluctuations and capitalize on 
emerging opportunities.
India, currently the world's sixth-largest domestic travel

travellers, partly due to escalating conflicts in West Asia and 
the redirection of foreign tourists from China following the 
Covid-19 pandemic.
The Indian government's concerted efforts to promote 
tourism, 
enhance 
infrastructure 
development, 
and 
streamline the ease of doing business have created a 
highly conducive environment for sustained growth within 
the hospitality sector. These initiatives, coupled with the 
strategic hosting of international events and conferences, 
present unparalleled opportunities for the industry to attract 
a substantial influx of international visitors. Such events

INDIAN CARD INDUSTRY
Overview
The Indian payment card sector has seen significant growth, 
reflecting global trends. According to Reserve Bank of India 
(RBI) data, in FY2024, credit card transactions increased by 
22.2% to 3.6 trillion transactions. This surge is attributed 
to the government's push for digitalization, increased 
consumer trust in digital payments, and the expanding 
e-commerce market.
The digital payments landscape in India has been propelled 
by various factors, including demonetization, government 
initiatives, and the widespread use of smartphones. The RBI 
reported a record 164.4 billion digital transactions in FY2024, 
marking a 44.3% increase from FY2023.31 Contactless

more popular, aided by the introduction of the National 
Common Mobility Card (NCMC) by the Ministry of Housing 
and Urban Affairs.
The regulatory framework for the card industry in India 
has seen significant changes to enhance security, promote 
innovation, and protect consumer interests. Fintech startups 
and established companies worked together to create 
innovative payment solutions, such as digital wallets, 
UPI-based apps, and payment gateways. The National 
Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) introduced Open APIs, 
facilitating seamless integration between different payment 
systems, and promoting interoperability, which enhanced 
the overall user experience.
The credit card industry in India has witnessed significant 
growth and evolution in recent years, fuelled by increasing 
consumer 
spending, 
digitalization, 
and 
expanding 
financial inclusion initiatives. With a rising middle class 
and a rising number of digitally savvy consumers, credit 
cards have become a preferred mode of payment for 
transactions ranging from everyday purchases to high-value 
expenditures. 
As per RBI data, the number of credit cards in circulation in 
India has grown by 19.3% from 85.3 million in March 2022 
end to 101.8 million in March 2024 end. Frost and Sullivan 
further forecasts the circulation to expand to 339 million 
by FY2030F growing at a CAGR of 22.2%. With the increase 
in number of credit cards in circulation, there is also an 
increase in the average value of transaction per credit card 
has increased to INR 1.8 lakh in FY2024 at a growth of 7.1% 
over INR 1.7 lakh in FY2023.

Outlook
Technological 
advancements, 
evolving 
consumer 
preferences, and the continuous expansion of e-commerce 
are propelling the growth of the global payment card 
industry. According to a Research and Markets report, the 
global payment processing solutions market experienced 
significant growth, increasing from USD 104.7 billion in 
2023 to USD 121.8 billion in 2024, at a growth rate of 16.3%. 
This market is projected to reach USD 227.2 billion by 2028, 
with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.9%.32 
Key drivers of this growth include the rising contactless 
payments, blockchain integration, embedded payments, 
enhanced cybersecurity measures, and the proliferation 
of mobile wallets. Additionally, trends such as biometric 
authentication, the Internet of Things (IoT) in payment 
systems, 
subscription-based 
payment 
models, 
user 
experience improvements, and the globalization of payment 
solutions will significantly shape the industry’s future.
The expansion of payment processing solutions is largely 
driven by the surging e-commerce sales and widespread 
internet access. Consumers' increasing preference for 
online shopping is fuelled by easy internet access, seamless 
transactions, 
diverse 
product 
offerings, 
personalized 
incentives, and the convenience of avoiding physical stores. 
The COVID-19 pandemic further accelerated this shift, 
emphasizing the need for secure and integrated payment 
processing systems.

Annual Report 2023-24
Consequently, the demand for mobile payment solutions 
and digital wallets has risen, supported by the widespread 
use of smartphones and the convenience they offer for 
transactions. Contactless payments have seen rapid growth 
due to the convenience and hygiene they offer, particularly 
highlighted during the pandemic. 
According to IMARC Group, the global contactless payment 
market reached USD 15.2 billion in 2023 and is expected 
to grow to USD 38.1 billion by 2032, with a CAGR of 10.7% 
from 2023 to 2032.33 Factors driving this growth include 
the increasing demand for convenient and hygienic 
payment methods, widespread adoption of smartphones 
and wearable devices, and advancements in secure 
payment technologies like Near Field Communication 
and tokenization. The digitization of the banking, financial 
services, and insurance (BFSI) industry is also a significant 
growth driver.
In India, the payment card industry is anticipated to grow 
robustly in the coming years. Innovative payment solutions 
such as biometric authentication and tokenization are 
expected to enhance the security and convenience of card 
payments. The RBI's goal of achieving 10 billion digital 
transactions per month by 2024 highlights the substantial 
potential for growth in India's payment card industry.
As digital payments become more widespread, ensuring 
transaction security, and protecting customer data will be 
critical. Regulatory bodies are likely to introduce stricter 
guidelines and standards to enhance security measures and 
safeguard consumer interests. Furthermore, government 
initiatives like the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) 
and Bharat Bill Payment System (BBPS), coupled with the 
integration of Aadhaar for financial inclusion, will drive the 
growth of digital payments in rural and underserved areas.
As per Mordor Intelligence, the Indian e-commerce market 
is estimated to be worth USD 112.9 billion in CY2024 and is 
expected to grow to USD 299.0 billion by CY2029F, with a 
CAGR of 21.5%.34 This growth highlights the rising preference 
for online shopping and digital payments, further driving 
the use of payment cards in India.
The industry has been witnessing ongoing structural changes 
wherein the card issuers providing blanket card benefits are 
now moving towards spend-based benefits. However, as per 
RBI data, there has also been a noticeable increase in the 
average spend per credit card to about INR 1.80 lakh during 
FY2024, from INR 1.68 lakh in FY2023, an increase of about 
7.1% over previous year, indicating long-term sustainability 
of the lounge access through credit card in India.  
Rapid urbanization and increased internet penetration are 
primary drivers of the market's growth. The widespread use 
of devices like smartphones, laptops, and tablets has made 
access to e-commerce platforms easier, allowing businesses 
to operate without needing physical stores, resulting in 
significant savings on infrastructure and overhead costs. 
INDIAN RAILWAY INDUSTRY
In FY2024, Indian Railways has demonstrated remarkable 
growth and modernization, reflecting its commitment to 
providing comfortable and efficient services to passengers 
and freight operators alike. By March 15, 2024, Indian 
Railways achieved a total revenue of INR 2.4 trillion, reflecting 
a robust 7.6% increase from INR 2.2 trillion in the same period 
previous year. This financial success is complemented by a 
significant 8.7% increase in passenger numbers, reaching 
648 crores compared to 596 crores last year.35
Indian Railways has made significant strides in its 
modernization efforts in FY2024, introducing several key 
advancements. The network has seen enhancements in 
freight loading capabilities, the introduction of new Vande 
Bharat Trains, increased capital expenditure allocations, 
comprehensive 
station 
redevelopment 
projects, 
the 
implementation of the Kavach safety system, extensive track 
laying, and electrification initiatives. By November 2023, 
60,814 km of India's broad-gauge network had been 
electrified, a substantial increase from 21,801 km in FY2014. 
Notably, 14 states and union territories now boast 100% 
electrified rail tracks.36 
Over the past nine years (FY2014-23), Indian Railways has 
completed 25,871 Route Kilometres (RKM) of track work, 
significantly outpacing the 14,985 RKM completed between 
FY2004-14. There were 35 Vande Bharat Express trains in 
operation, all domestically designed, providing 70 services 
across the nation. This fleet is set to expand with six 
additional trains, increasing the total number of services to 
82 and extending coverage to 247 districts.37
The continued growth and modernization of railway 
infrastructure have also spurred the development of 
ancillary industries, including enhanced railway lounge 
services, ensuring a more comfortable and seamless travel 
experience for passengers

Our Company focuses on aggregating new contemporary 
or other than lounge services to its portfolio of offerings. 
Access to golf games and lessons through the acquisition 
of GolfKlik; ultra luxury experiences like members-only 
club, private yacht, tickets for global sporting events; airport 
transfer services; E-Sim; health services; Salon services and 
Gifting services; are some of the services we have added 
to our portfolio during the year. In addition to this, our 
Company is aggregating new lounge services as it is now 
offering lounges not only at the airport but also at railway 
stations, highways, and visa application centers.
In addition to adding new services, DreamFolks is focused on 
partnering with OTAs, airlines, and enterprises, to broaden 
its market reach and diversify the client base. The Company 
has added several enterprise clients belonging to various 
industries like fintech, e-commerce, etc. Along with this, our 
Company is focused on deepening engagement with existing 
clients by offering a broader range of contemporary services 
to them. Increasing wallet share of the client will enable 
our Company to provide more value, strengthen client 
loyalty and drive higher revenues per client. Our Company 
has launched an exclusive membership initiative, the 
DreamFolks Club, which offers a range of membership 
packages where the services are bundled together into 
different budget ranges. 
DreamFolks is also committed to expanding its footprints and 
go global. For this purpose, our Company had established 
a wholly owned subsidiary in Singapore. Our Company 
has recruited professionals to drive the expansion efforts 
from Singapore. This move is aimed at leveraging Southeast 
Asia’s robust economic growth and will serve as a gateway 
to broader opportunities. Our Company has also partnered 
with another leading global lounge aggregator to significantly 
expand its reach and presence across the globe.
With the evolving nature of the industry where many 
clients are looking to implement spend and usage-based 
solutions, we witnessed rapid adoption of our spend and 
usage-based solutions by our clients to optimize the total 
cost of ownership of the product offerings and launch 
new product initiatives. The clients also use our tiers 
technology to define a few tiers of benefits with each tier 
having a different number of benefits and access to more 
premium services like Airport Transfer and Meet and Assist, 
depending on the annual spend. All this is done using our 
in-house developed platform.
Information Technology
Our Company’s in-house proprietary technology platform is 
a crucial asset and forms the backbone of our operations. 
The entire platform and technology are cloud-based, which 
bodes well with our Company’s strategy of maintaining an 
asset-light and low-cost business model. 
Levering the state-of-the-art technology, our Company 
targets to enhance the spending habits of its clients 
by offering customized, tailor-made solutions for each 
client and presenting a high-quality Consumer Value 
Proposition to the end consumers rather than a one size 
fits all solution. It also provides the clients clear visibility 
into the benefits and services provided by DreamFolks 
and enables them to effectively monitor and optimize the 
spends on product P&L and implement targeted benefits for 
the profitable customers.
The access to lounges and other benefits are enabled 
through an omnichannel approach which involves access 
to services through DreamFolks App, credit/debit cards, 
card issuer applications, self-check-in kiosks, web-based 
portal, etc. All this is facilitated by the hybrid technology 
developed by DreamFolks. It allows our Company to push 
the boundaries by developing new solutions based on the 
evolving market trends and have a rapid adoption due to 
the concentrated market share.

Opportunities
Our enterprise has discerned several critical opportunities 
that are poised to catalyze growth and fortify our market 
position. These opportunities are meticulously aligned with 
our strategic imperatives and are projected to significantly 
augment our long-term prosperity. Primary areas of 
emphasis include:
Encouraging Industry Climate
The Indian aviation and airline ancillary sector are on the cusp 
of a significant upsurge, driven by a confluence of favorable 
factors. The resurgence in travel demand, spurred by a 
burgeoning middle class and escalating disposable income, 
is set to propel the industry’s expansion. Projections indicate 
a robust annual growth rate of 9.0% in air passenger traffic 
in India over the next two decades. In response to this 
burgeoning demand, the Indian government has unveiled 
ambitious plans to take number of operational airports 
to over 200 by 2035, in addition to expanding existing 
facilities, thereby substantially enhancing air connectivity 
and accessibility.

Domestic Passenger Traﬃc (In Million)
Furthermore, the government’s UDAN scheme, which 
aims to promote regional air connectivity, is anticipated to 
further stimulate domestic air travel. The rapid assimilation 
of digital technologies is revolutionizing the airline ancillary 
domain, transforming passenger interactions with airlines. 
Innovations such as mobile check-ins, digital boarding 
passes, personalized travel recommendations, and in-flight 
connectivity are enhancing convenience and enabling 
airlines to generate ancillary revenue through targeted 
advertising and personalized services.
Expanding Demand for Airport Services
The global travel industry is experiencing an unprecedented 
surge in demand for airport services, driven by an uptick in 
business and leisure travel. To capitalize on this trend, our 
Company intends to invest in advanced technology and 
infrastructure to elevate the customer experience and offer 
a gamut of lifestyle services. Strategies to meet the evolving 
needs of travelers include enhancing service quality, 
streamlining operations, and implementing innovative 
solutions. By leveraging our platform for dynamic benefit 
selection overlaid with data analytics and feedback, we 
will be able to tailor services for a more personalized and 
gratifying experience.
Corporate Travel and Workcation Trends
The pandemic-induced shift in work patterns has given rise to 
the trend of workcations, where individuals amalgamate work 
and travel experiences. This phenomenon has transformed 
the travel industry, leading to the development of bespoke 
products and marketing strategies. Workcations have also 
encouraged the exploration of lesser-known destinations, 
benefiting local economies. Our Company aims to capitalize 
on this trend by offering services specifically designed to 
cater to the unique needs of corporate & business travelers 
and workcations.
Harnessing Technological Innovations
Embracing technological advancements presents substantial 
opportunities for operational enhancement and superior 
customer experiences. Our Company plans to invest in 
cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), 
machine learning, and data analytics to streamline processes 
and offer personalized services. AI-powered chatbots will 
enhance customer support, while data analysis will inform 
service customization based on customer preferences and 
feedback. Investments in research and development will 
further augment our capabilities, including the development 
of card-based and digital access and billing services, 
attracting more operators and consumers, and increasing 
market share and revenue.
Exploiting Financial Inclusion
In India, the current level of card penetration is relatively 
low, presenting a significant opportunity for our Company 
to leverage the increasing financial inclusion initiatives 
in the country. As more individuals are introduced to the 
benefits of debit and credit cards, we plan to offer attractive 
incentives and rewards to encourage the use of our platform. 
With our innovative solutions and customer-centric 
approach, we are confident in enhancing the growth of the 
card industry in India.
Augmented Discretionary Spending
As the pandemic recedes, individuals are experiencing 
increased disposable income, leading to a rise in discretionary 
spending. This shift has resulted in more individuals 
allocating funds toward travel. Following a prolonged period 
of isolation, many are eager to explore new destinations 
and immerse themselves in diverse cultural experiences. 
This surge in discretionary spending enables us to leverage 
our products and services to capitalize on this burgeoning 
opportunity.
By strategically positioning ourselves to leverage these 
growth opportunities, our Company is well-equipped to 
enhance its market presence and achieve sustained success 
in the airline ancillary services industry.
Value-Added Services
Integration of diverse value-added services through strategic 
tie-ups presents expansive opportunities to elevate offerings 
for our club members, enhancing their experience and 
reinforcing our brand’s commitment to luxury, convenience, 
and well-being. Our Company has added a host of services 
other than Airport lounges to its service offerings, some of 
which are Golf Games and Lessons, Meet and Assist, Railway 
Lounges, Airport Transfers, Car Rentals, Beauty & Grooming 
Services, etc. By strategically partnering with top-tier 
providers to offer these diverse value-added services, we 
significantly enhance the travel experience for our club 
members, catering to their varied needs and preferences. 
These tie-ups not only create new revenue streams but also 
strengthen our standing as a premier provider of luxury, 
convenience, and exceptional service in the airline ancillary 
services industry.

Internal Control Systems and Their Adequacy
Dreamfolks Services Limited has established robust internal 
control systems that align with our Company's size and 
industry, demonstrating a strong commitment to integrity 
and ethics. The internal control system is designed to 
achieve strategic objectives, ensure operational efficiency, 
and comply with laws and regulations, thereby minimizing 
errors, theft, and fraud. Regular monitoring assesses the 
adequacy, effectiveness, and usefulness of these financial 
and operational controls. It enhances the reliability and 
accuracy of accounting data, provides reasonable assurance 
in recording, and providing reliable financial and operational 
information, safeguarding assets, executing authorized 
transactions, and ensuring compliance with corporate 
policies. The Audit Committee, comprising the Board of 
Directors, oversees the annual audit plan and examines key 
findings, addressing deviations promptly with corrective 
measures to strengthen the control framework. 
The internal audit function is crucial in evaluating and 
monitoring our Company's internal controls and processes 
through risk-based audits and periodic reviews. The Internal 
Auditor reports directly to the Audit Committee, which 
regularly reviews audit findings and the adequacy and 
effectiveness of control measures. Based on these 
evaluations, the Board of Directors believes our Company 
has an adequate and effective internal control system as of 
March 31, 2024.

We constantly endeavour to improve our investor services 
and benchmark ourselves against best practices. We have 
a dedicated Investor Relations team which services the

developments, and to exchange information. 
The Chairperson & Managing Director, Executive Director 
& Chief Technology Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and the 
Chief Business Officer, along with our Investor Relations

objectives, 
projections, 
estimates,

expectations, 
as defined by relevant securities laws and regulations.

Dear Stakeholders
At Dreamfolks, we are deeply committed to leading our efforts in addressing one of the most 
pressing challenges of our era: climate change. Climate change presents an urgent and formidable 
challenge that demands immediate and sustained action. In recognizing this, our approach to 
sustainability transcends mere compliance.  In my last statement, I have outlined our priority in 
harnessing the power of technology and innovation to make a significant societal impact, with a 
central focus on environmental stewardship. I am happy to share that we have made significant 
strides towards this commitment. During FY23-24, through constant research and development, 
we have introduced significant changes in our delivery model, which eliminates the need to use 
plastic cards to use our platform. This initiative can lead to a significant reduction in plastic usage. 
Additionally, we have also introduced web access and QR code access, which has reduced the use 
of paper by eliminating the need to generate the transaction slip. Apart from technology-driven 
interventions, we are continuously to putting efforts into creating a more sustainable workspace 
by investing in indoor plants and LED lighting. All these initiatives will go a long way in contributing 
their bit to the environment.  Within the organization, we are also continuously working to (a) 
strengthen our governance and risk management systems by investing in systems and processes 
and (b) create a healthier workspace that not only attracts and retains talent but also offers an 
environment that promotes diversity and inclusion without free of any discrimination. 
We are committed to authenticate our CSR practices through creating ground level impact in the 
lives of underprivileged girl children, providing smoother access to education through programs 
such as Akshar. 
Sustainability goes beyond mere concept for Dreamfolks. We keep a track of our footprint in 
various aspects and take conscious measures to reduce it, setting reasonable targets. Our tech 
platform is designed in a manner that has eradicated the use of plastic and paper in one go. 
I thank all the stakeholders for continuous support while we advance in our mission.

Independent Auditors’ Report 
To the Members of Dreamfolks Services Limited 
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying Standalone Financial 
Statements of Dreamfolks Services Limited (“the Company”), 
which comprise the Balance sheet as at March 31, 2024, 
the Statement of profit and loss, including the Statement 
of Other Comprehensive income, the Cash Flow Statement 
and the Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then 
ended, and notes to the Standalone Financial Statements, 
including a summary of material accounting policies and 
other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as 
the “Standalone Financial Statements”). 
In our opinion and to the best of our information and 
according to the explanations given to us the aforesaid 
Standalone Financial Statements give the information 
required by the Companies Act, 2013, as amended (“the 
Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair 
view in conformity with the accounting principles generally 
accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as 
at March 31, 2024, its profit including other comprehensive 
loss, its cash flows and the statement of changes in equity 
for the year ended on that date. 
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of the Standalone Financial 
Statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing 
(SAs), as specified under section 143(10) of the Act. 
Our responsibilities under those Standards are further 
described in the ‘Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of 
the Standalone Financial Statements’ section of our report. 
We are independent of the Company in accordance with 
the ‘Code of Ethics’ issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India together with the ethical requirements 
that are relevant to our audit of the Standalone Financial 
Statements under the provisions of the Act and the 
Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and 
the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our audit opinion on the Standalone Financial Statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the 
Standalone Financial Statements for the financial year 
ended March 31, 2024. These matters were addressed in the 
context of our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements 
as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do 
not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each 
matter below, our description of how our audit addressed 
the matter is provided in that context. 
We have determined the matters described below to be 
the key audit matters to be communicated in our report. 
We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the 
auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the Standalone 
Financial Statements section of our report, including in 
relation to these matters.
REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Key audit matters
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Revenue recognition 
The Company through its platform allows transactions 
between the consumers of its clients and service operators 
enlisted with the platform. The Company earns revenue 
when the consumers of its clients utilize services such as 
lounge access, meet and assist, airport transfers, food and 
beverages, door-step baggage and spa & wellness either 
through the DreamFolks App, DreamFolks Card, Issuer’s 
Card, Issuer’s Website, Issuer’s Web or Mobile Application 
(App) or Interactive Voice Response (IVR). 
Revenue is recognized as the services are performed in 
accordance with contractual terms. The Company’s invoicing 
cycle is on contractual predetermined dates.
Revenues relating to services rendered as a key audit matter 
as the Company has to ensure that revenue is recorded 
based on (1) contractual terms and (2) total passengers 
(pax) who utilized services, which is considered on the basis 
of report from digital platform.
Our audit approach was a combination of test of controls and 
substantive procedures which included amongst others the 
following: 
a)	
Tested the total no of passengers (pax), who have utilized 
the Company’s services and verified the sale with these 
billable number of pax.
b)	
Tested the effectiveness of controls relating to recording 
of unbilled revenues.
c)	
Tested revenue recognition by agreeing key terms used 
for recording revenue with terms in the signed contracts 
and subsequent confirmation received from customers 
after the balance sheet date.
d)	
Tested unbilled revenues with subsequent invoicing 
based on customer acceptances.
Information Other than the Standalone Financial 
Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the 
other information. The other information comprises the 
information included in the Annual Report but does not 
include the Standalone Financial Statements and our 
auditor’s report thereon. The Annual Report is expected 
to be made available to us after the date of this auditors’ 
report. Our opinion on the Standalone Financial Statements 
does not cover the other information and we do not express 
any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the Standalone Financial 
Statements, our responsibility is to read the other 
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other 
information is materially inconsistent with the Standalone 
Financial Statements, or our knowledge obtained in the audit 
or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. When we 
read Annual Report, if we conclude that there is a material 
misstatement therein, we are required to communicate the 
matter to those charged with governance.
Responsibilities of Management for the Standalone 
Financial Statements 
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the 
matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the 
preparation of these Standalone Financial Statements that 
give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial 
performance including other comprehensive income, cash 
flows and changes in equity of the Company in accordance 
with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, 
including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified 
under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies 
(Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. 
This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate 
accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the 
Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for 
preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; 
selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; 
making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance 
of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating 
effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness 
of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation 
and presentation of the Standalone Financial Statements 
that give a true and fair view and are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In 
preparing 
the 
Standalone 
Financial 
Statements, 
Management is responsible for assessing the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as 
applicable, matters related to going concern and using the 
going concern basis of accounting unless management 
either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease 
operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The Company’s Board of Directors are also responsible for 
overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Standalone Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the Standalone Financial Statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our 
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it 
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they 
could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these Standalone 
Financial Statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:
•	 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of 
the Standalone Financial Statements, whether due to fraud 
or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive 
to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk 
of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from 
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud 
may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. 
•	 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to 
the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)
(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our 
opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal 
financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial 
Statements in place and the operating effectiveness of 
such controls.
•	 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used 
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and 
related disclosures made by management. 
•	 Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of 
the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the 
audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty 
exists related to events or conditions that may cast 
significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty 
exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s 
report to the related disclosures in the Standalone 
Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, 
to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the 
audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s 
report. However, future events or conditions may cause 
the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. 
•	 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content 
of the Standalone Financial Statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the Standalone Financial 
Statements represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

Annual Report 2023-24
We communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and 
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including 
any significant deficiencies in internal control that we 
identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a 
statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate 
with them all relationships and other matters that may 
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and 
where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of 
most significance in the audit of the Standalone Financial 
Statements for the financial year ended March 31, 2024 
and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these 
matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation 
precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in 
extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter 
should not be communicated in our report because the 
adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably 
be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of 
such communication.

ANNEXURE B TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF 
DREAMFOLKS SERVICES LIMITED OF EVEN DATE
Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 
2013 (“the Act”)
(Referred to in paragraph 2(f) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report of even date)
We have audited the internal financial controls over financial 
reporting of Dreamfolks Services Limited (“the Company”) as of 
March 31, 2024 in conjunction with our audit of the Standalone 
Financial Statements of the Company for the year ended on 
that date.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Con-
trols
The Company’s Management is responsible for establishing and 
maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal 
control over financial reporting criteria established by the 
Company considering the essential components of internal 
control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial 
Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of 
Chartered Accountants of India. These responsibilities include 
the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate 
internal financial controls that were operating effectively for 
ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, 
including adherence to the Company’s policies, the safeguarding 
of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, 
the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, 
and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as 
required under the Companies Act, 2013. 
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s 
internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference 
to these Standalone Financial Statements based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance 
Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial 
Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) and the Standards on Auditing 
as specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, 
to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls 
and, both issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of 
India. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we 
comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the 
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate 
internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference 
to these Standalone Financial Statements was established 
and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all 
material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls 
over financial reporting with reference to these Standalone 
Financial Statements and their operating effectiveness. 
Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting 
included obtaining an understanding of internal financial 
controls over financial reporting with reference to these 
Standalone Financial Statements, assessing the risk that a 
material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design 
and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the 
assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s 
judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material 
misstatement of the Standalone Financial Statements, whether 
due to fraud or error. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the 
internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference 
to these Standalone Financial Statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial 
Reporting with reference to these Standalone Financial 
Statements
A company’s internal financial control over financial reporting 
with reference to these Standalone Financial Statements is a 
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding 
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of 
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal 
financial control over financial reporting with reference to 
these Standalone Financial Statements includes those policies 
and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records 
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the 
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) 
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded 
as necessary to permit preparation of Standalone Financial 
Statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company 
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of 
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide 
reasonable 
assurance 
regarding 
prevention 
or 
timely 
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of 
the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the 
Standalone Financial Statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over 
Financial Reporting with reference to these Standalone Fi-
nancial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls 
over financial reporting with reference to these Standalone 
Financial Statements, including the possibility of collusion 
or improper management override of controls, material 
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be 
detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal 
financial controls over financial reporting with reference to 
these Standalone Financial Statements to future periods 
are subject to the risk that the internal financial control over 
financial reporting with reference to these Standalone Financial 
Statements may become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or 
procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, 
adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting with 
reference to these Standalone Financial Statements and such 
internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference 
to these Standalone Financial Statements were operating 
effectively as at March 31, 2024, based on the internal control 
over financial reporting criteria established by the Company 
considering the essential components of internal control stated 
in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls 
Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India.

1.	 	 CORPORATE INFORMATION
Dreamfolks Services Limited (the ‘Company’) primarily 
integrates global card networks operating in India, 
card issuers, and corporate clients including airline 
companies with various airport lounge operators, 
transport operators and other airport service providers 
on a unified technology platform. The company is 
engaged in providing benefit management services 
through a proprietary technology platform that 
empowers clients such as banks, card networks, 
airlines, and corporations to tailor airport and lifestyle 
service offerings for their end customers.
The Company is incorporated and domiciled in 
India under the provisions of the Companies Act, 
2013 applicable in India. The registered office of the 
Company is located at 26, DDA Flats, Panchsheel Park, 
Shivalik Road, Malviya Nagar New Delhi- 110017 India. 
These financial statements are adopted by the Board 
of Directors during the meeting held on May 28, 2024.
2.1	 	 Basis of Preparation
The financial statements of the Company is prepared 
to comply in all material respects with the Indian 
Accounting Standards (“Ind AS”) notified under the 
Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 
2015 as amended time to time and presentation 
requirements of Division II of Schedule III to the 
Companies Act, 2013, (Ind AS compliant Schedule III), 
as applicable to the financial statements and other 
relevant provisions of the Act. 
The financial statements of the Company have been 
prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the 
following assets and liabilities which have been 
measured at fair value or revalued amount:
•	 	
Certain financial assets and liabilities measured 
at fair value (refer accounting policy regarding 
financial instruments), and
•	 	
Contingent consideration. The company has 
prepared the financial statements on the 
basis that it will continue to operate as a going 
concern.
The accounting policies as set out in the following 
paragraphs of this note, have been consistently 
applied, by the Company, to all the periods presented 
in the said financial statements.
2.2	 Critical accounting estimates and assumptions
The preparation of the financial statements in 
conformity with the principles of Ind AS requires 
the management to make judgements, estimates 
and assumptions that effect the reported amounts 
of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the 
disclosure of contingent liabilities, at the end of the 
reporting period. Although these estimates are based 
on the management’s best knowledge of current events 
and actions, uncertainty about these assumptions and 
estimates could result in the outcomes requiring a 
material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets 
or liabilities in future periods. 
The estimates and underlying assumptions are 
reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting 
estimates are recognised in the period in which the 
estimate is revised if the revision affects only that 
period, or in the period of the revision and future 
periods if the revision affects both current and 
future periods. In particular, information about the 
significant areas of estimation, uncertainty and critical 
judgements in applying accounting policies that have 
the most significant effect on the amounts recognised 
in the financial statements.
There are no assumptions and estimation uncertainties 
that have a significant risk of resulting in a material 
adjustment within the next financial year except for as 
disclosed in these financial statements. 
Information about significant areas of estimation /
uncertainty and judgements in applying accounting 
policies that have the most significant effect on the 
financial statements are as follows: - 
Impairment of financial assets 
The Company determines the allowance for credit 
losses based on policy for expected loss provision 
based on experiential realisations, current and 
estimated future economic conditions. The Company 
considered current and anticipated future economic 
conditions relating to industries the Company deals 
with and the countries where it operates. 
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment represent a significant 
proportion of the asset base of the company. 
The useful lives and residual values of property, plant 
and equipment are determined by the management 
based on technical assessment by internal team and 
external advisor. The charge in respect of periodic 
depreciation is derived after determining an estimate 
of an asset’s expected useful life and the expected 
residual value at the end of its life. The Company 
believes that the useful life best represents the period 
over which the Company expects to use these assets.
Contingent liabilities
Management judgment is required for estimating the 
possible outflow of resources, if any, in respect of 
contingencies/claim/litigations against the Company 
as it is not possible to predict the outcome of pending 
matters with accuracy.  
Income taxes
Management judgment is required for the calculation 
of provision for income taxes and deferred tax assets 
and liabilities. The Company reviews at each balance 
sheet date the carrying amount of deferred tax assets. 
The factors used in estimates may differ from actual 
outcome which could lead to significant adjustment to 
the amounts reported in the financial statements.
Leases
Judgment required to ascertain lease classification, 
lease term, incremental borrowing rate, lease and 
non-lease component and impairment of ROU.
3.	 Summary of material accounting policies
3.1	 Business combinations and goodwill
In accordance with Ind AS 101 provisions related 
to first time adoption, the Company had elected to 
apply Ind AS accounting for business combinations 
prospectively from the date of transition to Ind AS i.e. 
April 1, 2019. As such, Indian GAAP balances relating 
to business combinations entered into before that 
date, including goodwill, have been carried forward 
to Ind AS financial statements on the transition date. 
Business combination post April 1, 2019 had been 
accounted for as per Ind AS including the accounting 
for amortising the value of resulting goodwill.
3.2	 Current versus non- current classification
The Company presents assets and liabilities in the 
financial statements of assets and liabilities based on 
current/ non-current classification. An asset is treated 
as current when it is:
•	 Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or 
consumed in normal operating cycle
•	 Held primarily for the purpose of trading
•	 It is expected to be realised within twelve months 
after the reporting period, or
•	 Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from 
being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at 
least twelve months after the reporting period. 
All other assets are classified as non-current.
All other assets are classified as non-current. 
A liability is current when:
•	 It is expected to be settled in normal operating 
cycle
•	 Held primarily for the purpose of trading
•	 It is due to be settled within twelve months after 
the reporting period, or
•	 There is no unconditional right to defer the 
settlement of the liability for at least twelve months 
after the reporting period.
The Company classifies all other liabilities as 
non-current. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
classified as non-current assets and liabilities.
The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition 
of assets for processing and their realisation in cash 
and cash equivalents. The Company has identified 
twelve months as its operating cycle.
3.3	 Foreign currencies
The Company’s financial statements are presented 
in INR, which is also its functional currency. 
Functional currency is the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the Company 
operates and is normally the currency in which the 
Company primarily generates and expends cash.
Foreign currency transactions are recorded at the 
exchange rate prevailing on the date of transaction. 
Foreign currency rate fluctuations relating to monetary 
assets and liabilities are restated at the year-end rates. 
The net gain or loss arising on restatement/ settlement 
is recorded in Statement of Profit and Loss.
Non‑monetary assets and non-monetary liabilities 
denominated in a foreign currency and measured 
at historical cost are translated at the exchange rate 
prevalent at the date of the transaction. The related 
revenue and expense are recognized using the same 
exchange rate.
3.4	 Fair value measurement
The Company measures financial instruments such as 
derivatives at fair value at each balance sheet date.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell 
an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly 
transaction between market participants at the 
measurement date. The fair value measurement is 
based on the presumption that the transaction to sell 
the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:
1.	 In the principal market for the asset or liability, or
2.	 In the absence of a principal market, in the most 
advantageous market for the asset or liability The 
principal or the most advantageous market must 
be accessible by the Company.
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured 
using the assumptions that market participants would 
use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that 
market participants act in their economic best interest.
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset 
takes into account a market participant’s ability to 
generate economic benefits by using the asset in its 
highest and best use or by selling it to another market 
participant that would use the asset in its highest and 
best use.

All amounts are in INR Million, unless otherwise stated
The Company uses valuation techniques that are 
appropriate in the circumstances and for which 
sufficient data are available to measure fair value, 
maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and 
minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is 
measured or disclosed in the financial statements are 
categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described 
as follows, based on the lowest level input that is 
significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:
1.	 Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in 
active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
2.	 Level 2 — Valuation techniques for which the 
lowest level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement is directly or indirectly observable.
3.	 Level 3 — Valuation techniques for which the 
lowest level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement is unobservable.
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the 
financial statements on a recurring basis, the Company 
determines whether transfers have occurred between 
levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation 
(based on the lowest level input that is significant to 
the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of 
each reporting period.
External valuers may be required for valuation of 
significant assets and liabilities. Involvement of 
external valuers is decided on the basis of nature of 
transaction and complexity involved. Selection criteria 
include market knowledge, reputation, independence 
and whether professional standards are maintained.
At each reporting date, the finance team analyses 
the movements in the values of assets and liabilities 
which are required to be remeasured or re-assessed 
as per the Company’s accounting policies. For this 
analysis, the team verifies the major inputs applied 
in the latest valuation by agreeing the information 
in the valuation computation to contracts and 
other relevant documents. A change in fair value 
of assets and liabilities is also compared with 
relevant external sources to determine whether the 
change is reasonable.
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Company 
has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the 
basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the 
asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy 
as explained above.
This note summarises accounting policy for fair value. 
Other fair value related disclosures are given in the 
relevant notes.
3.5	 Property, plant and equipment
An item of property, plant and equipment is 
recognised as an asset if it is probable that future 
economic benefits associated with the item will flow 
to the Company and its cost can be measured reliably. 
This recognition principle is applied to costs incurred 
initially to acquire an item of property, plant and 
equipment and also to costs incurred subsequently to 
add to, replace part of, or service it. All other repair 
and maintenance costs, including regular servicing, 
are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss 
as incurred. Where an item of property, plant and 
equipment comprises major components having 
different useful lives, these components are accounted 
for as separate items. 
The cost of property, plant and equipment comprises 
its purchase price net of any trade discounts and 
rebates, any import duties and other taxes (other 
than those subsequently recoverable from the tax 
authorities), any directly attributable expenditure on 
making the asset ready for its intended use, other 
incidental expenses and interest on borrowings 
attributable to acquisition of qualifying fixed assets 
up to the date the asset is ready for its intended 
use. Subsequent expenditure on fixed assets after 
its purchase / completion is capitalized only if such 
expenditure results in an increase in the future 
benefits from such asset beyond its previously 
assessed standard of performance. The Company 
depreciates property, plant and equipment over their 
estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. 
Depreciation methods and useful lives are reviewed 
periodically at each financial year end. The gain or loss 
arising on disposal of an item of property, plant and 
equipment is determined as the difference between 
sale proceeds and carrying value of such item and is 
recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
3.6	 	 Intangible assets
Design, development and software costs are included 
in the balance sheet as intangible assets when it is 
probable that associated future economic benefits 
would flow to the Company. All other costs on the 
aforementioned are expensed in the statement of 
profit and loss as and when incurred. Intangible assets 
are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and 
accumulated impairment. The estimated useful life of 
an identifiable intangible asset is based on a number 
of factors including the effects of obsolescence, 
demand, competition, and other economic factors 
(such as the stability of the industry and known 
technological advances). Amortization methods and 
useful lives are reviewed periodically including at each 
financial year end.
Amortisation 
method: 
The 
Company 
amortizes 
intangible assets with a future useful life using the 
straight-line method over following period: 
Class of assets 
Useful life 
Computer Software 
3 years
3.7	 	 Investment property 
Investment properties are measured initially at cost, 
including transaction costs. Subsequent to initial 
recognition, investment properties are stated at cost 
less accumulated depreciation and accumulated 
impairment loss, if any.
The cost includes the cost of replacing parts and 
borrowing costs for long-term construction projects 
if the recognition criteria are met. When significant 
parts of the investment properties are required to be 
replaced at intervals, the Company depreciates them 
separately based on their specific useful lives. All other 
repair and maintenance costs are recognised in profit 
or loss as incurred.
The company depreciates building component of 
investment property over 30 years using written down 
value method from the date of original purchase.
The company, based on technical assessment 
made 
by 
technical 
expert 
and 
management 
estimate, depreciates the building over estimated 
useful lives which are different from the useful life 
prescribed in Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013. 
The management believes that these estimated useful 
lives are realistic and reflect fair approximation of the 
period over which the assets are likely to be used.
Though 
the 
company 
measures 
investment 
properties 
using 
cost-based 
measurement, 
the 
fair value of investment properties are disclosed 
in the notes. Fair values are determined based on 
an annual evaluation performed by an accredited 
external independent valuer applying a valuation 
model recommended by the International Valuation 
Standards Committee.
Investment 
properties 
are 
derecognised 
either 
when they have been disposed of or when they are 
permanently withdrawn from use and no future 
economic benefit is expected from their disposal. 
The difference between the net disposal proceeds and 
the carrying amount of the asset is recognised in profit 
or loss in the period of derecognition. In determining 
the amount of consideration from the derecognition 
of investment properties the Company considers 
the effects of variable consideration, existence 
of a significant financing component, non-cash 
consideration, and consideration payable to the 
buyer (if any).
Transfers are made to (or from) investment properties 
only when there is a change in use. Transfers between 
investment property, owner-occupied property and 
inventories do not change the carrying amount of 
the property transferred and they do not change 
the cost of that property for measurement or 
disclosure purposes.
3.8	 Depreciation of property, plant and equipment 
Depreciation is provided on the written down value 
method. The estimated useful life of each asset as 
prescribed under Schedule II of the Companies Act, 
2013 and based on technical assessment of internal 
experts (after considering the expected usage of the 
asset, expected physical wear and tear, technical and 
commercial obsolescence and understanding of past 
practices and general industry experience) are as 
depicted below:  
Particulars

Office equipment
3-5 Years
Motor vehicles
8-10 Years
The residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and 
adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting 
period. Lease hold Improvements are amortised on a 
straight-line basis over the lease period. 
3.9	 Leases
The Company’s leased assets primarily consist of 
leases for office space. The Company assesses whether 
a contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. 
A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys 
the right to control the use of an identified asset for 
a period in exchange for consideration. To assess 
whether a contract conveys the right to control the use 
of an identified asset, the Company assesses whether: 
•	 the contract involves the use of an identified asset 
•	 the Company has substantially all of the economic 
benefits from use of the asset through the period 
of the lease; and
•	 the Company has the right to direct the use of the 
asset.
	
	 1.	 Right of use assets
	
At the date of commencement of the lease, the 
Company recognizes a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) 
and a corresponding lease liability for all lease 
arrangements in which it is a lessee, except 
for leases with a term of twelve months or less 
(short-term leases) and low value leases. For these

All amounts are in INR Million, unless otherwise stated
short-term and low-value leases, the Company 
recognizes the lease payments as an operating 
expense on a straight -line basis over the term of 
the lease. 
	
The right-of-use assets are initially recognized at 
cost, which comprises the initial amount of the 
lease liability adjusted for any lease payments 
made at or prior to the commencement date of 
the lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease 
incentives. They are subsequently measured at cost 
less accumulated depreciation and impairment 
losses. Right-of-use assets are depreciated from 
the commencement date on a straight-line basis 
over the shorter of the lease term and useful life 
of the underlying asset unless the lease transfers 
ownership of the underlying asset to the Company 
by the end of the lease term or the cost of the 
right-of-use asset reflect that the Company exercise 
a purchase option. The Company applies Ind AS 36 to 
determine whether a right-of-use asset is impaired 
and accounts for any identified impairment loss 
as described in the accounting policy below on 
“Impairment of non- financial assets”.
	
	 2.	 Lease liabilities
	
The lease liability is initially measured at amortized 
cost at the present value of the future lease 
payments that are not paid at the commencement 
date. The lease payments are discounted using 
the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not 
readily 
determinable, 
using 
the 
Company’s 
incremental borrowing rates. Lease liabilities are 
remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to 
the related right of use asset (or in profit or loss if 
the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has 
been reduced to zero) if the Company changes its 
assessment of whether it will exercise an extension 
or a termination or a purchase option. The interest 
cost on lease liability (computed using effective 
interest method), is expensed in the statement of 
profit and loss. 
	
Lease liability and right-of-use asset have been 
separately presented in the Balance Sheet and 
lease payments have been classified as financing 
cash flows. The Company has applied a practical 
expedient wherein the Company has ignored the 
requirement to separate non- lease components 
(such as maintenance services) from the lease 
components. Instead, the Company has accounted 
for the entire contract as a single lease contract.
3.10	 Revenue recognition
The 
Company 
has 
revenue 
from 
its 
clients. 
The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies 
performance obligations under the terms of its 
contracts, and control of its services is transferred 
to its client’s users in an amount that reflects the 
consideration the Company expects to receive from 
its client in exchange for those services. This process 
involves identifying the client contract, determining the 
performance obligations in the contract, determining 
the contract price, allocating the contract price to 
the distinct performance obligations in the contract, 
and recognizing revenue when the performance 
obligations have been satisfied. 
The Company through its platform allows transactions 
between the consumers of its clients and service 
operators enlisted with the platform. The Company 
earns revenue when the consumers of its clients 
utilize services such as Lounge Access, Meet and 
Assist, Airport Transfers, Food and Beverages, 
Door-step Baggage and Spa & Wellness either through 
the DreamFolks App, DreamFolks Card, Issuer’s Card, 
Issuer’s Website, Issuer’s web or mobile Application 
(App) or Interactive voice response (IVR). 
Revenue is recognised in the accounting period in 
which the services are rendered. A receivable is 
recognised when the goods are delivered as this is the 
point in time that the consideration is unconditional 
because only the passage of time is required before 
the payment is due
Cash received before the goods and services are 
delivered is recognised as a contract liability. 
Financing Components: The Company does not expect 
to have any contracts where the period between the 
transfer of the promised goods or services to the 
customer and payment by the customer exceeds 
one year. As a consequence, the Company does 
not adjust any of the transaction prices for the time 
value of money.
Other income
Interest income from a financial asset is recognised 
when it is probable that the economic benefits will 
flow to the Company and the amount of income can 
be measured reliably. Interest income is accrued on 
a time proportion basis, by reference to the principal 
outstanding and effective interest rate applicable, 
which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated 
future cash receipts through the expected life of the 
financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount on 
initial recognition. 
3.11	 Retirement and other employee benefits
Employee benefits include provident fund, employee 
state insurance scheme, gratuity and compensated 
absences. 
Long-term employee benefits:
Defined 
contribution 
plans: 
The 
Company's 
contribution to provident fund and employee 
state insurance scheme are considered as defined 
contribution plans and are charged as an expense based 
on the amount of contribution required to be made 
and when services are rendered by the employees. 
Defined benefit plans: The Company has Defined 
Benefit Plan in the form of Gratuity. Liability for Defined 
Benefit Plans is provided on the basis of valuations, 
as at the balance sheet date, carried out by an 
independent actuary. The defined benefit obligation 
is calculated annually by independent actuary using 
the projected unit credit method. The present value 
of the defined benefit obligation is determined by 
discounting the estimated future cash outflows using 
discount rate (interest rates of government bonds) that 
have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of 
the gratuity. Remeasurement gains and losses arising 
from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial 
assumptions are recognised in the period in which 
they occur, directly in other comprehensive income. 
They are included in ‘Other comprehensive income’ 
(net of taxes) in the statement of changes in equity 
and in the balance sheet. Net interest is calculated by 
applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit 
liability or asset. The Company presents the first two 
components of defined benefit costs in profit or loss in 
the line item ‘Employee Benefits Expense’. 
Short-term employee benefits:
The undiscounted amount of short-term employee 
benefits expected to be paid in exchange for the 
services rendered by employees are recognised 
during the year when the employees render the 
service. These benefits include performance incentive 
and compensated absences which are expected to 
occur within twelve months after the end of the period 
in which the employee renders the related service. 
The cost of short-term compensated absences is 
accounted as under: 
•	 in case of accumulated compensated absences, 
when employees render the services that increase 
their entitlement of future compensated absences; 
and
•	 in 
case 
of 
non-accumulating 
compensated 
absences, when the absences occur.
3.12	 Share based payments 
Employees (including senior executives) of the 
Company receive remuneration in the form of share 
based payment transactions, whereby employees 
render services as consideration for equity instruments 
(equity-settled transactions). The cost of equity-settled 
transactions is determined by the fair value at the 
date when the grant is made using an appropriate 
valuation model. That cost is recognised, together 
with a corresponding increase in share Options 
outstanding reserves in equity, over the period in 
which the performance and/or service conditions are 
fulfilled in employee benefits expense. 
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled 
transactions at each reporting date until the vesting 
date reflects the extent to which the vesting period 
has expired and the Company’s best estimate of the 
number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. 
The statement of profit and loss expense or credit 
for a period represents the movement in cumulative 
expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that 
period and is recognised in employee benefits expense. 
When the terms of an equity-settled award are 
modified, the minimum expense recognised is the 
expense had the terms had not been modified, if the 
original terms of the award are met. An additional 
expense is recognised for any modification that 
increases the total fair value of the share-based 
payment transaction or is otherwise beneficial to the 
employee as measured at the date of modification. 
Where an award is cancelled by the entity or by 
the counterparty, any remaining element of the 
fair value of the award is expensed immediately 
through profit or loss. 
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected 
as additional share dilution in the computation of 
diluted earnings per share.
3.13	 Taxes
a.	
Current income tax
Current tax is the tax payable on the taxable profit 
for the year. Taxable profit differs from 'profit before 
tax' as reported in the Statement of Profit and Loss 
because of items of income or expense that are taxable 
or deductible in other years and items that are never 
taxable or deductible. The Company's current tax is 
calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the end of the reporting 
period, in accordance with the Income Tax Act, 1961. 
Current income tax relating to items recognised outside 
financial statements profit and loss is recognised 
outside financial statements profit and loss (either in 
other comprehensive income or in equity). Current tax 
items are recognised in correlation to the underlying 
transaction either in OCI or directly in equity. 
Management periodically evaluates positions taken 
in the tax returns with respect to situations in which 
applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation 
and establishes provisions where appropriate.
Advance taxes and provisions for current income 
taxes are presented in the statement of assets and 
liabilities after off-setting advance tax paid and income 
tax provision arising in the same tax jurisdiction and 
where the relevant tax paying units intends to settle 
the asset and liability on a net basis.
b.	
Deferred taxes
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for 
the future tax consequences of temporary differences

All amounts are in INR Million, unless otherwise stated
All amounts are in INR Million, unless otherwise stated
between the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets are 
recognised for all deductible temporary differences 
and unused tax losses only if it is probable that future 
taxable amounts will be available to utilise those 
temporary differences and losses. 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed 
at the end of each reporting period and reduced to 
the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient 
taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of 
the asset to be recovered. 
Deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured at 
the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period 
in which the liability is settled or the asset is realised, 
based on the tax rates (and tax laws) that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the 
reporting period. 
The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets 
reflects the tax consequences that would follow from 
the manner in which the Company expects, at the 
end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the 
carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when 
there is a legally enforceable right to offset current 
tax assets and liabilities and where the deferred tax 
balances relate to the same taxation authority. 
Current tax assets and tax liabilities are off set where 
the entity has a legally enforceable right to offset and 
intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realize the 
asset and settle the liability simultaneously. 
Current and deferred tax is recognised in profit or 
loss, except to the extent that it relates to items 
recognised in other comprehensive income or directly 
in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in 
other comprehensive income or directly in equity, 
respectively.
3.14	 Segment reporting
Operating segments are defined as components of an 
entity where discrete financial information is evaluated 
regularly by the chief operating decision maker 
(“CODM”) in deciding allocation of resources and in 
assessing performance. The Company’s Managing 
Director is its CODM. The Company’s CODM reviews 
financial information presented on a consolidated 
basis for the purposes of making operating decisions, 
allocating 
resources, 
and 
evaluating 
financial 
performance. Our business activity primarily falls 
within a single business and geographical segment, 
hence, the disclosure of segment-wise information is 
not applicable under Ind AS 108- 'Operating Segments'. 
3.15	 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is computed using the 
weighted average number of equity shares outstanding 
during the period. Diluted earnings per share is 
computed using the weighted-average number of 
equity and dilutive equivalent shares outstanding 
during the period, except where the results would be 
anti-dilutive. 
The number of equity shares and potentially 
dilutive equity shares are adjusted retrospectively 
for all periods presented for any splits and bonus 
shares issues including for change effected prior 
to the approval of the financial Information by the 
Board of Directors.
3.16	 Provisions and contingent liabilities
1.	
	 Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a 
present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of 
a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources 
embodying economic benefits will be required to 
settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be 
made of the amount of the obligation. The expense 
relating to a provision is presented in the statement of 
profit and loss net of any reimbursement. If the effect 
of the time value of money is material, provisions 
are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that 
reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the 
liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the 
provision due to the passage of time is recognised 
as a finance cost.
2.	
Contingent liabilities
Contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises 
from past events and the existence of which will be 
confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence 
of one are more uncertain future events not wholly 
within the control of the Company, or is a present 
obligation that arises from past event but is not 
recognised because either it is not probable that 
an outflow of resources embodying economic 
benefits will be required to settle the obligation, or 
a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation 
cannot be made. Contingent liabilities are disclosed 
and not recognised.
3.17	 Financial instruments
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to 
a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or 
equity instrument of another entity. Transaction costs 
directly attributable to the acquisition of financial 
assets or financial liabilities at fair value through 
statement 
of 
profit 
and 
loss 
are 
recognised 
immediately in statement of profit and loss.
1.	
Financial assets
All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value 
plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair 
value through statement of profit and loss, transaction 
costs that are attributable to the acquisition of 
the financial asset. Purchases or sales of financial 
assets that require delivery of assets within a time 
frame established by regulation or convention in the 
market-place (regular way trades) are recognised 
on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Company 
commits to purchase or sell the asset.
	
	 a.	 Classification and subsequent measurement: 
	
Debt instruments that meet the following conditions 
are subsequently measured at amortised cost less 
impairment loss (except for debt investments that 
are designated as at fair value through profit or loss 
on initial recognition) (i) the asset is held within a 
business model whose objective is to hold assets 
in order to collect contractual cash flows; and (ii) 
the contractual terms of the instrument give rise 
on specified dates to cash flows that are solely 
payments of principal and interest on the principal 
amount outstanding.
	
Debt 
instruments 
that 
meet 
the 
following 
conditions are subsequently measured at fair value 
through other comprehensive income (except for 
debt investments that are designated as at fair 
value through profit or loss on initial recognition) 
(i) the asset is held within a business model whose 
objective is achieved both by collecting contractual 
cash flows and selling financial assets; and (ii) 
the contractual terms of the instrument give rise 
on specified dates to cash flows that are solely 
payments of principal and interest on the principal 
amount outstanding.
	
FVTPL is a residual category for debt instruments. 
Any debt instrument, which does not meet the 
criteria for categorization as at amortized cost or as 
FVTOCI, is classified as at FVTPL. Trade receivables, 
cash and cash equivalents, other bank balances, 
loans and other financial assets are classified for 
measurement at amortised cost.
	
Financial assets at amortised cost are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using effective 
interest method. The effective interest method is 
a method of calculating the amortised cost of an 
instrument and of allocating interest income over 
the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the 
rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash 
receipts (including all fees paid or received that 
form an integral part of the effective interest rate, 
transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) 
through the expected life of the debt instrument, 
or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net 
carrying amount on initial recognition.
	
	 b.	 Equity instruments:
	
The Company subsequently measures all equity 
investments in scope of Ind AS 109 at fair value, 
with net changes in fair value recognised in the 
statement of profit and loss.
	
c.	
Derecognition
	
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a 
financial asset or part of a group of similar financial 
assets) is primarily derecognised (i.e. removed from 
the Company’s financial statements of assets and 
liabilities) when: i) The rights to receive cash flows 
from the asset have expired, or ii) The Company 
has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from 
the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the 
received cash flows in full without material delay to 
a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; 
and either (a) the Company has transferred 
substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, 
or (b) the Company has neither transferred nor 
retained substantially all the risks and rewards of 
the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
	
When the Company has transferred its rights to 
receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into 
a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if and to 
what extent it has retained the risks and rewards 
of ownership. When it has neither transferred nor 
retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of 
the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the 
Company continues to recognise the transferred 
asset to the extent of the Company’s continuing 
involvement. In that case, the Company also 
recognises an associated liability. The transferred 
asset and the associated liability are measured on 
a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that 
the Company has retained.
	
Continuing involvement that takes the form of a 
guarantee over the transferred asset is measured 
at the lower of the original carrying amount of the 
asset and the maximum amount of consideration 
that the Company could be required to repay.
	
	 d.	 Impairment of financial assets
	
	
The Company recognises loss allowances using the 
Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model for the financial 
assets which are not fair valued through profit and 
loss. Loss allowance for trade receivables with no 
significant financing component is measured at an 
amount equal to lifetime ECL. For all other financial 
assets, expected credit losses are measured at an 
amount equal to the 12-month ECL, unless there has 
been a significant increase in credit risk from initial 
recognition, in which case those financial assets are 
measured at lifetime ECL. The changes (incremental 
or reversal) in loss allowance computed using ECL 
model, are recognised as an impairment gain or 
loss in the statement of profit and loss. 
The Company recognises loss allowances for 
expected credit losses on financial assets measured 
at amortised cost.

All amounts are in INR Million, unless otherwise stated
At each reporting date, the Company assesses 
whether financial assets carried at amortised cost 
are credit impaired. A financial asset is ‘credit 
impaired’ when one or more events that have a 
detrimental impact on the estimated future cash 
flows of the financial asset have occurred. 
Evidence that a financial asset is credit impaired 
includes the following observable data:
•	 significant financial difficulty of the borrower or 
issuer;
•	 a breach of contract such as a default or past 
dues;
•	 the restructuring of a loan or advance by the 
Company on terms that the Company would 
not consider otherwise; - it is probable that the 
borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial 
reorganisation; or 
•	 the disappearance of an active market for a 
security because of financial difficulties. 
The Company follows ‘simplified approach’ for 
recognition of impairment loss allowance on trade 
receivables which do not contain a significant 
financing component. The application of simplified 
approach does not require the Company to 
track changes in credit risk. Rather, it recognises 
impairment loss allowance based on lifetime 
impairment pattern at each balance sheet date, 
right from its initial recognition. 
In all cases, the maximum period considered when 
estimating expected credit losses is the maximum 
contractual period over which the Company is 
exposed to credit risk. 
When determining whether the credit risk of a 
financial asset has increased significantly since 
initial recognition and when estimating expected 
credit losses, the Company considers reasonable 
and supportable information that is relevant and 
available without undue cost or effort. This includes 
both quantitative and qualitative information 
and analysis, based on the Company’s historical 
experience and informed credit assessment and 
including forward looking information. 
The Company considers a financial asset to be in 
default when: 
•	 the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit 
obligations to the Company in full, without 
recourse by the Company to actions such as 
realising security (if any is held); or 
•	 the financial asset is more than past due. 
The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is 
written off (either partially or in full) to the extent 
that there is no realistic prospect of recovery. This is 
generally the case when the Company determines 
that the counterparty does not have assets or 
sources of income that could generate sufficient 
cash flows to repay the amounts subject to 
write-off. However, financial assets that are written 
off could still be subject to enforcement activities 
in order to comply with the Company's procedures 
for recovery of amounts due.
2.	
	 Financial liabilities
	
	 Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, 
as financial liabilities at fair value through profit and 
loss, loans and borrowings, payables, as appropriate. 
	
	 a.	 Initial recognition and measurement
	
	
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair 
value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and 
payables, net of directly attributable transaction 
costs. The Company’s financial liabilities include 
Borrowings, Other Financial Liabilities, Trade 
Payables and Leases.
	
	 b.	 Subsequent measurement
	
	
All financial liabilities are subsequently measured 
at amortized cost using the effective interest 
method or at FVTPL. For financial liabilities that 
are denominated in a foreign currency and are 
measured at amortized cost at the end of each 
reporting period, the foreign exchange gains and 
losses are determined based on the amortized 
cost of the instruments and are recognized in 
‘Other income’. The fair value of financial liabilities 
denominated in a foreign currency is determined 
in that foreign currency and translated at the spot 
rate at the end of the reporting period. For financial 
liabilities that are measured as at FVTPL, the foreign 
exchange component forms part of the fair value 
gains or losses and is recognized in profit or loss. 
	
	 c.	 Derecognition
	
	
The Company derecognizes financial liabilities 
when, and only when, the Company’s obligations 
are 
discharged, 
cancelled 
or 
have 
expired. 
The difference between the carrying amount 
of the financial liability derecognized and the 
consideration paid and payable is recognized in 
statement of profit and loss.
	
	 d.	 Offsetting of financial instruments
	
	
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset 
and the net amount is reported in the statement 
of assets and liabilities if there is a currently 
enforceable legal right to offset the recognised 
amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net 
basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities 
simultaneously.
3.18	 Impairment of non-financial assets
The carrying amounts of assets are reviewed at 
each balance sheet date. If there is any indication 
of 
impairment 
based 
on 
internal 
/ 
external 
factors, an impairment loss is recognised, i.e. 
wherever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its 
recoverable amount. 
For impairment testing, assets that do not generate 
independent cash inflows are Companied together 
into 
cash-generating 
units 
(CGUs). 
Each 
CGU 
represents the smallest Company of assets that 
generates cash inflows that are largely independent of 
the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs. 
The recoverable amount of a CGU (or an individual 
asset) is the higher of its value in use and its fair value 
less costs to sell. Value in use is based on the estimated 
future cash flows, discounted to their present value 
using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of money and 
the risks specific to the CGU (or the asset). 
The Company’s corporate assets (e.g., office building 
for providing support to various CGUs) do not 
generate independent cash inflows. To determine 
impairment of a corporate asset, recoverable amount 
is determined for the CGUs to which the corporate 
asset belongs.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount 
of an asset or CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable 
amount. Impairment losses are recognised in 
the statement of profit and loss. Impairment loss 
recognised in respect of a CGU is allocated first to 
reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated 
to the CGU, and then to reduce the carrying amounts 
of the other assets of the CGU (or group of CGUs) on 
a pro rata basis. 
An impairment loss in respect of assets for which 
has been recognised in prior periods, the Company 
reviews at each reporting date whether there is any 
indication that the loss has decreased or no longer 
exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has 
been a change in the estimates used to determine the 
recoverable amount. Such a reversal is made only to 
the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not 
exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no 
impairment loss had been recognised.
3.19	 Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which 
they occur. Borrowing cost consist of interest and 
other costs that an entity incurs in connection with 
the borrowing of funds. Borrowing cost also includes 
exchange differences to the extent regarded as an 
adjustment to the borrowing costs.
3.20	 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalent in the statement of assets 
and liabilities comprise cash at banks and on hand and 
short-term deposits with an original maturity of three 
months or less, which are subject to an insignificant 
risk of changes in value. For the purpose of the 
statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents 
consist of cash and short-term deposits, as defined 
above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts (if any) as 
they are considered an integral part of the Company’s 
cash management.
3.21	 Cash flow statement
Cash flows are reported using the indirect method, 
whereby loss for the period is adjusted for the effects 
of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or 
accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or 
payments and item of income or expenses associated 
with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows 
from operating, investing and financing activities of 
the Company are segregated.
3.22	 Events occurring after the balance sheet date
Based on the nature of the event, the Company 
identifies the events occurring between the balance 
sheet date and the date on which the financial 
statements are approved as ‘Adjusting Event’ and 
‘Non-adjusting event’. Adjustments to assets and 
liabilities are made for events occurring after the 
balance sheet date that provide additional information 
materially affecting the determination of the amounts 
relating to conditions existing at the balance sheet 
date or because of statutory requirements or because 
of their special nature. For non-adjusting events, the 
Company may provide a disclosure in the financial 
statements considering the nature of the transaction.
3.23	 Functional and presentation currency 
The Company has determined the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which the Company 
operates, i.e., the functional currency, to be Indian 
Rupees (INR). The financial statements are presented 
in Indian Rupees, which is the Company's functional 
and presentation currency. All amounts have been 
rounded to the nearest Million up to two decimal places, 
unless otherwise stated. Consequent to rounding off, 
the numbers presented throughout the document 
may not add up precisely to the totals and percentages 
may not precisely reflect the absolute amounts. 
3.24	 Recent accounting pronouncements
During the year ended March 31, 2024, Ministry of 
Corporate Affairs (MCA) has not notified any new 
standards or amendments to the existing standards 
applicable to the Company.

Contract assets
A contract asset is the right to consideration in exchange for services transferred to the customer. If the Company performs 
by transferring services to a customer before the customer pays consideration or before payment is due, a contract asset 
is recognized for the earned consideration that is conditional. The contract assets are transferred to receivables when the 
rights to consideration become unconditional. This usually occurs when the Company issues an invoice to the customers.
Contract liabilities
A contract liability is the obligation to transfer services to a customer for which the Company has received consideration 
from the customer. If a customer pays consideration before the Company transfers services to the customer, a contract 
liability is recognised when the payment is made. Contract liabilities are recognized as revenue when the Company 
performs under the contract.

Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
The Company is principally exposed to risk against USD. Sensitivity of profit or loss arises mainly from USD 
denominated receivables and payables. 
As per management’s assessment of reasonable possible changes in the exchange rate of (+/-) 5% between USD- INR 
currency pair, sensitivity of profit or loss only on outstanding USD denominated monetary items at the period end is 
presented below:
USD sensitivity at year end

As per management’s opinion, the sensitivity analysis is unrepresentative of the inherent foreign exchange risk 
because the exposure at the end of the reporting period does not reflect the exposure during the year.
B	
Credit risk:
Credit risk from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed in accordance with the Company’s policy.

II.	 Gratuity
	
The Company have an obligation towards gratuity, a defined benefit plan covering eligible employees as per the Payment 
of Gratuity Act, 1972. The plan provides for a lump-sum payment to vested employees at retirement, death while in 
employment or on termination of employment of an amount equivalent to 15 days salary payable for each completed 
year of service. Vesting occurs upon completion of five years of service. The gratuity benefits are unfunded.
	
Gratuity liability is provided for on the basis of an actuarial valuation on projected unit credit method made at the end 
of each financial year. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated 
future cash outflows by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting year on government bonds that have terms 
approximating to the terms of the related obligation.
	
The Company regularly assesses these assumptions with the projected long-term plans and prevalent industry standards.
III.	 Leave plan and compensated absences
	
The Company has a leave encashment scheme with defined benefits for its employees. The Company makes provision 
for such liability in the books of accounts on the basis of year end actuarial valuation. No fund has been created for this 
scheme.

Employee Stock Option Plan 2021 namely “ESOP 2021” was adopted by the Board of Directors vide its resolution dated 
September 28, 2021 and by the shareholders vide its resolution dated September 29, 2021. Under the ESOP 2021, the 
Company granted stock options (“”Grant 1””) to the eligible employees of Company which will vest over a period of 3 years 
from date of Grant and are exercisable for a period of 5 years once vested.  . 
	
The Nomination and Remuneration Committee of the Company has approved further grants (“”Grant 2 and Grant 3””) 
under ESOP 2021 with related vesting conditions. Vesting of the options would be subject to continuous employment 
and certain performance parameters stipulated by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee of the Company. 
Hence the options would vest with the passage of the time on meeting the performance parameters. However, the 
above performance condition is only considered in determining the numbers of instruments that will ultimately vest. 
Options have been granted with vesting period of up to 7 years and are exercisable for a period of 5 years once vested.  
	
The fair value of the share options is estimated at the grant date using the Black- Scholes option pricing model, taking into 
account the terms and conditions upon which the share options were granted.  
	
There are no cash settlement alternatives. The Company does not have a past practice of cash settlement for these share 
options.

statement and the consolidated statement of changes 
in equity for the year then ended, and notes to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements, including a summary 
of significant accounting policies and other explanatory 
information (hereinafter referred to as the “Consolidated

In our opinion and to the best of our information and 
according to the explanations given to us and based on the 
consideration of reports of the other auditors on separate 
financial statements of the subsidiaries referred to in the 
other matters section below, the aforesaid  Consolidated 
Financial Statements give the information required by the 
Companies Act, 2013, as amended (“the Act”) in the manner 
so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with 
the Indian accounting Standards prescribed under section 
133 of the Act read with the relevant rules made thereunder, 
as amended, and other accounting principles generally 
accepted in India, of the consolidated state of affairs of 
the Group as at March 31, 2024, their consolidated profit 
including the other consolidated comprehensive loss, their 
consolidated cash flows and the consolidated statement of 
changes in equity for the year ended on that date. 
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of the  Consolidated Financial 
Statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing 
(SAs), as specified under section 143(10) of the Act. 
Our responsibilities under those Standards are further 
described in the ‘Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit 
of the  Consolidated Financial Statements’ section of our 
report. We are independent of the Group in accordance 
with the ‘Code of Ethics’ issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India together with the ethical requirements 
that are relevant to our audit of the  Consolidated Financial 
Statements under the provisions of the Act and the 
Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements 
and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence 
we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide 
a basis for our audit opinion on the  Consolidated 
Financial Statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the

Holding Company
Revenue recognition :
The Company through its platform allows 
transactions between the consumers of its 
clients and service operators enlisted with 
the platform. The Company earns revenue 
when the consumers of its clients utilize 
services such as lounge access, meet and 
assist, airport transfers, food and beverages, 
door-step baggage and spa & wellness either 
through the DreamFolks App, DreamFolks 
Card, Issuer’s Card, Issuer’s Website, Issuer’s 
web or mobile application (App) or interactive 
voice response (IVR). 
Services are performed in accordance with 
contractual terms. The Company’s invoicing 
cycle is on contractual predetermined dates.
Revenues relating to services rendered as 
a key audit matter as the Company has to 
ensure that revenue is recorded based on (1) 
contractual terms and (2) total passengers 
(pax) who utilized services, which is considered 
on the basis of report from digital platform.
Our audit approach was a combination of 
test of controls and substantive procedures 
which 
included 
amongst 
others 
the 
following: 
a.	
Tested the total no of passengers 
(pax), who have utilized the Company’s 
services and verified the sale with these 
billable number of pax.
b.	
Tested the effectiveness of controls 
relating 
to 
recording 
of 
unbilled 
revenues.
c.	
Tested revenue recognition by agreeing 
key terms used for recording revenue 
in the signed contracts and subsequent 
confirmation received from customers 
after the balance sheet date.
d.	
Tested 
unbilled 
revenues 
with 
subsequent 
invoicing 
based 
on 
customer acceptances
Information other than the  Consolidated Financial 
Statements and Auditor’s Report thereon
The Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible 
for the other information. The other information comprises 
the information included in the Annual Report but does 
not include the  Consolidated Financial Statements and our 
auditor’s report thereon. The Annual Report is expected to 
be made available to us after the date of this auditor’s report. 
Our opinion on the  Consolidated Financial Statements does 
not cover the other information and we do not express any 
form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the  Consolidated Financial 
Statements, our responsibility is to read the other 
information and, in doing so, consider whether such other 
information is materially inconsistent with the  Consolidated 
Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit 
or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. When we 
read Annual Report, if we conclude that there is a material 
misstatement therein, we are required to communicate the 
matter to those charged with governance.
Responsibilities of Management for the  Consolidat-
ed Financial Statements
The Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible 
for the preparation and presentation of these  Consolidated 
Financial Statements in terms of the requirements of the Act 
that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial 
position, consolidated financial performance including 
other consolidated comprehensive income, consolidated 
cash flows and consolidated statement of changes in equity 
of the Group in accordance with the accounting principles 
generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting 
Standards (Ind AS) specified under section 133 of the Act 
read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 
Rules, 2015, as amended. The respective Board of Directors 
of the companies included in the Group are responsible for 
maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance 
with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets 
of the Group and for preventing and detecting frauds and 
other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate 
accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that 
are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation 
and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, 
that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy 
and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the

preparation and presentation of the  Consolidated Financial 
Statements that give a true and fair view and are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, 
which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements by the Directors of the 
Holding Company, as aforesaid.
In preparing the  Consolidated Financial Statements, the 
respective Board of Directors of the companies included 
in the Group are responsible for assessing the ability of 
the Group to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as 
applicable, matters related to going concern and using the 
going concern basis of accounting unless management 
either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, 
or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
Those respective Management of the companies included in 
the Group are also responsible for overseeing the financial 
reporting process of the Group.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the  Con-
solidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the  Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our 
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it 
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they 
could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these  Consolidated 
Financial Statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:
•	
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement 
of the  Consolidated Financial Statements, whether due 
to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures 
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence 
that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for 
one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, 
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or 
the override of internal control. 
•	
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to 
the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)
(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our 
opinion on whether the Holding Company has adequate 
internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements in place and the operating effectiveness of 
such controls.
•	
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates 
and related disclosures made by management. 
•	
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use 
of the going concern basis of accounting and, based 
on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material 
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions 
that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the 
Group to continue as a going concern. If we conclude 
that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to 
draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related 
disclosures in the  Consolidated Financial Statements 
or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our 
opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit 
evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s 
report. However, future events or conditions may cause 
the Group to cease to continue as a going concern. 
•	
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content 
of the  Consolidated Financial Statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the  Consolidated Financial 
Statements represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. 
•	
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding 
the financial information of the entities or business 
activities within the Group of which we are the 
independent auditors, to express an opinion on the 
Consolidated Financial Statements. We are responsible 
for the direction, supervision and performance of 
the audit of the financial statements of such entities 
included in the  Consolidated Financial Statements 
of which we are the independent auditors. For the 
other entities included in the  Consolidated Financial 
Statements, which have been audited by other auditors, 
such other auditors remain responsible for the 
direction, supervision and performance of the audits 
carried out by them. We remain solely responsible for 
our audit opinion.
We communicate with those charged with governance of 
the Holding Company and such other entities included in 
the  Consolidated Financial Statements of which we are the 
independent auditors regarding, among other matters the 
planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit 
findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal 
control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a 
statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate 
with them all relationships and other matters that may 
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and 
where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of 
most significance in the audit of the  Consolidated Financial 
Statements for the financial year ended March 31, 2024 
and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these 
matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation 
precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in 
extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter 
should not be communicated in our report because the 
adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably 
be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits 
of such communication.
Other Matter
We did not audit the financial statements and other financial 
information, in respect of two subsidiaries, whose financial 
statements include total assets of Rs 3.75 million as at 
March 31, 2024, and total revenues of Rs. Nil and net cash 
inflows of Rs. 3.03 million for the year ended on that date. 
These financial statements and other financial information 
have been audited by other auditors, whose audit reports 
for the year ended March 31, 2024 have been furnished to 
us by the management. Our opinion, in so far as it relates 
amounts and disclosures included in respect of these 
subsidiaries, and our report in terms of sub-sections (3) of 
Section 143 of the Act in so far as it relates to the aforesaid 
subsidiaries, is based solely report of other auditors. 
One subsidiary which is  located outside India, whose annual 
financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with accounting principles generally accepted in the 
country where it is incorporated. The Holding Company’s 
management has converted the financial statements of such 
subsidiary from accounting principles generally accepted in 
their country to accounting principles generally accepted in 
India. We have audited these conversion adjustments made 
by the Holding Company’s management. Our opinion, in so 
far as it relates to the amounts and disclosures included in 
respect of this subsidiary, is based on the audit report of 
other auditor and the conversion adjustments prepared by 
the management of the Holding Company and audited by us.
Our opinion above on the  Consolidated Financial 
Statements, and our report on Other Legal and Regulatory 
Requirements below, is not modified in respect of the above 
matter with respect to our reliance on the work done and 
report of the other auditors.

ANNEXURE A TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT OF EVEN DATE ON THE  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS OF DREAMFOLKS SERVICES LIMITED OF EVEN DATE
Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 
2013 (“the Act”)
(Referred to in paragraph 2(f) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report of even date)
In conjunction with our audit of the  Consolidated Financial 
Statements of the Holding Company as of and for the year 
ended March 31, 2024, we have audited the internal financial 
controls over financial reporting of Dreamfolks Services 
Limited (hereinafter referred to as “the Holding Company”) 
its subsidiaries (the Holding Company and its subsidiaries 
together referred to as “the Group”), which are companies 
incorporated in India, as of that date. 
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial 
Controls 
The respective Board of Directors of the Holding company 
and its subsidiary companies, which are companies 
incorporated in India, are responsible for establishing 
and maintaining internal financial controls based on the 
internal control over financial reporting criteria established 
by the Group considering the essential components of 
internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of 
Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued 
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI). 
These responsibilities include the design, implementation 
and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls 
that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly 
and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence 
to the respective company’s policies, the safeguarding of its 
assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, 
the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, 
and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, 
as required under the Companies Act, 2013. 
Auditor’s Responsibility 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal 
financial controls over financial reporting based on our 
audit of the Holding Company. We conducted our audit in 
accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal 
Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance 
Note”) issued by the ICAI and the Standards on Auditing, 
issued by ICAI and deemed to be prescribed under section 
143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable 
to an audit of internal financial controls, both issued by the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. Those Standards 
and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical 
requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal 
financial controls over financial reporting was established 
and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in 
all material respects. 
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial 
controls system over financial reporting and their operating 
effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over 
financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of 
internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing 
the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and 
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of 
internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures 
selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the 
financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained, and 
the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms 
of their reports referred to in the Other Matters paragraph 
below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
audit opinion on the Holding Company’s internal financial 
controls system over financial reporting.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over Finan-
cial Reporting 
A company's internal financial control over financial 
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable 
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting 
and the preparation of financial statements for external 
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles. A company's internal financial control over 
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures 
that: 
a)	
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable 
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and 
dispositions of the assets of the company;
b)	
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are 
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial 
statements 
in 
accordance 
with 
generally 
accepted 
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures 
of the company are being made only in accordance with 
authorizations of management and directors of the 
company; and 
c)	
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention 
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or 
disposition of the company's assets that could have a 
material effect on the financial statements. 
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls 
Over Financial Reporting 
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial 
controls over financial reporting, including the possibility 
of collusion or improper management override of controls, 
material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and 
not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the 
internal financial controls over financial reporting to future 
periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial 
control over financial reporting may become inadequate 
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of 
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
Opinion 
In our opinion, to the best of our information and according 
to the explanations, given to us the Holding Company and its 
subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in 
India, have, in all material respects, an adequate internal 
financial controls system over financial reporting and such 
internal financial controls over financial reporting were 
operating effectively as at March 31, 2024, based on the 
internal control over financial reporting criteria established 
by the Group considering the essential components of 
internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of 
Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued 
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. 
Other Matters 
Our aforesaid reports under Section 143(3) (i) of the 
Act on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of 
the internal financial controls over financial reporting 
of Holding Company, in so far as it relates to separate 
financial statements of one subsidiary companies which 
are companies incorporated in India, is based on the 
corresponding reports of the auditors of such companies. 
Our audit report is not modified in respect of this matter.

1.	 	 CORPORATE INFORMATION
Dreamfolks Services Limited (formerly known as 
Dreamfolks Services Private Limited) (the ‘Company’ 
or the 'Holding Company') and its subsidiaries 
Dreamfolks Services Pte Limited, Golfklik Private 
Limited (Formerly Vidsur Golf Private Limited)
and Dreamfolks Hospitality Private Limited (In the 
process of Voluntary Winding Up) (collectively, the 
'Group') primarily integrates global card networks 
operating in India, card issuers, and corporate clients 
including airline companies with various airport 
lounge operators, transport operators, Golf course 
operators and other airport service providers on a 
unified technology platform. The company is engaged 
in providing benefit management services through 
a proprietary technology platform that empowers 
clients such as banks, card networks, airlines, and 
corporations to tailor airport and lifestyle service 
offerings for their end customers.
The Company is incorporated and domiciled in 
India under the provisions of the Companies Act, 
2013 applicable in India. The registered office of the 
Company is located at 26, DDA Flats, Panchsheel Park, 
Shivalik Road, Malviya Nagar New Delhi- 110017 India. 
These consolidated financial statements are adopted 
by the Board of Directors during the meeting held on 
May 28, 2024.
2.	 	 BASIS OF PREPARATION
The consolidated financial statements of the Group 
have been prepared in accordance with Indian 
Accounting Standards (Ind AS) notified under the 
Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 
(as amended from time to time) and presentation 
requirements of Division II of Schedule III to the 
Companies Act, 2013, (Ind AS compliant Schedule III), 
as applicable to the CFS.
These consolidated financial statements have been 
prepared on historical cost basis except for certain 
financial instruments and defined benefit plans which 
are measured at fair value or amortised cost at the end 
of each reporting period. Historical cost is generally 
based on the fair value of the consideration given 
in exchange for goods and services. Fair value is the 
price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to 
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between 
market participants at the measurement date.
The statement of cash flows have been prepared under 
indirect method, whereby profit or loss is adjusted 
for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, 
any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating 
cash receipts or payments and items of income or 
expense associated with investing or financing cash 
flows. The cash flows from operating, investing and 
financing activities of the Group are segregated. 
The Group considers all highly liquid investments that 
are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and 
are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value 
to be cash equivalents.
The significant accounting policies used in preparation 
of the consolidated financial statements have been 
discussed in the respective notes.
3.	 	 BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The Company consolidates all entities which are 
controlled by it. 
The Company establishes control when; it has power 
over the entity, is exposed, or has rights, to variable 
returns from its involvement with the entity and has 
the ability to affect the entity’s returns by using its 
power over relevant activities of the entity. 
Entities controlled by the Company are consolidated 
from the date control commences until the date 
control ceases. The results of subsidiaries acquired, 
or sold, during the year are consolidated from the 
effective date of acquisition and up to the effective 
date of disposal, as appropriate. 
The financial statements of the Group companies 
are consolidated on a line-by-line basis and all 
inter-company transactions, balances, income and 
expenses are eliminated in full on consolidation. 
Changes in the Company’s interests in subsidiaries 
that do not result in a loss of control are accounted 
for as equity transactions. The carrying amount of the 
Company’s interests and the non-controlling interests 
are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative 
interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference between 
the amount by which the non-controlling interests 
are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration 
paid or received is recognised directly in equity and 
attributed to shareholders of the Company.

4.	 	 SUMMARY 
OF 
MATERIAL 
ACCOUNTING 
POLICIES
4.1	 	 Use of estimates
The 
preparation 
of 
the 
consolidated 
financial 
statement in conformity with the principles of Ind 
AS requires the management to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions that effect the reported 
amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities 
and the disclosure of contingent liabilities, at the end 
of the reporting period. Although these estimates 
are based on the management’s best knowledge 
of current events and actions, uncertainty about 
these assumptions and estimates could result in 
the outcomes requiring a material adjustment 
to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities 
in future periods.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are 
reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting 
estimates are recognised in the period in which 
the estimate is revised if the revision affects only 
that period, or in the period of the revision and 
future periods if the revision affects both current 
and future periods.
In particular, information about the significant areas 
of estimation, uncertainty and critical judgements 
in applying accounting policies that have the most 
significant effect on the amounts recognised in the 
Consolidated Financial Statement.
There are no assumptions and estimation uncertainties 
that have a significant risk of resulting in a material 
adjustment within the next financial year except for as 
disclosed in these financial statements. 
4.2	 Critical accounting estimates and judgements
Information about significant areas of estimation /
uncertainty and judgements in applying accounting 
policies that have the most significant effect on the 
financial statements are as follows: - 
Impairment of financial assets 
The Group determines the allowance for credit losses 
based on policy for expected loss provision based on 
experiencial realisations, current and estimated future 
economic conditions. The Group considered current 
and anticipated future economic conditions relating 
to industries the Group deals with and the countries 
where it operates. 
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment represent a significant 
proportion of the asset base of the group. The useful 
lives and residual values of property, plant and 
equipment are determined by the management based 
on technical assessment by internal team and external 
advisor. The charge in respect of periodic depreciation 
is derived after determining an estimate of an asset’s 
expected useful life and the expected residual value at 
the end of its life. The Group believes that the useful 
life best represents the period over which the Group 
expects to use these assets.
Contingent liabilities
Management judgment is required for estimating the 
possible outflow of resources, if any, in respect of 
contingencies/claim/litigations against the Group as 
it is not possible to predict the outcome of pending 
matters with accuracy.  
Income taxes
Management judgment is required for the calculation 
of provision for income taxes and deferred tax assets 
and liabilities. The Group reviews at each balance 
sheet date the carrying amount of deferred tax assets. 
The factors used in estimates may differ from actual 
outcome which could lead to significant adjustment to 
the amounts reported in the financial statements.
Leases
Judgment required to ascertain lease classification, 
lease term, incremental borrowing rate, lease and 
non-lease component and impairment of ROU.
4.3	 	 Business combinations and goodwill
Business combinations are accounted for using 
the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition 
is measured as the aggregate of the consideration 
transferred measured at acquisition date fair value 
and the amount of any non-controlling interests in the 
acquiree. For each business combination, the Group 
elects whether to measure the non-controlling interests 
in the acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate 
share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. 
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. 
The Group determines that it has acquired a business 
when the acquired set of activities and assets include 
an input and a substantive process that together 
significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. 
The acquired process is considered substantive if it is 
critical to the ability to continue producing outputs, and 
the inputs acquired include an organised workforce 
with the necessary skills, knowledge, or experience 
to perform that process or it significantly contributes 
to the ability to continue producing outputs and is 
considered unique or scarce or cannot be replaced 
without significant cost, effort, or delay in the ability to 
continue producing outputs.
At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets 
acquired, and the liabilities assumed are recognised 
at their acquisition date fair values. For this purpose, 
the liabilities assumed include contingent liabilities 
representing present obligation and they are measured 
at their acquisition fair values irrespective of the 
fact that outflow of resources embodying economic 
benefits is not probable. However, the following assets 
and liabilities acquired in a business combination are 
measured at the basis indicated below: 
•	 Deferred tax assets or liabilities, and the liabilities or 
assets related to employee benefit arrangements 
are recognised and measured in accordance with 
Ind AS 12 Income Tax and Ind AS 19 Employee 
Benefits respectively.
•	 Potential tax effects of temporary differences and 
carry forwards of an acquiree that exist at the 
acquisition date or arise as a result of the acquisition 
are accounted in accordance with Ind AS 12.
•	 Assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held 
for sale in accordance with Ind AS 105 Non-current 
Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations 
are measured in accordance with that Standard. 
Reacquired rights are measured at a value determined 
on the basis of the remaining contractual term of the 
related contract. Such valuation does not consider 
potential renewal of the reacquired right.
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the 
financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate 
classification and designation in accordance with 
the contractual terms, economic circumstances 
and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date. 
This includes the separation of embedded derivatives 
in host contracts by the acquiree.
If the business combination is achieved in stages, any 
previously held equity interest is re-measured at its 
acquisition date fair value and any resulting gain or loss 
is recognised in profit or loss or OCI, as appropriate. 
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess 
of the aggregate of the consideration transferred 
and the amount recognised for non-controlling 
interests, and any previous interest held, over the net 
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. 
If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess 
of the aggregate consideration transferred, the Group 
re-assesses whether it has correctly identified all of 
the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed 
and reviews the procedures used to measure the 
amounts to be recognised at the acquisition date. 
If the reassessment still results in an excess of the 
fair value of net assets acquired over the aggregate 
consideration transferred, then the gain is recognised 
in OCI and accumulated in equity as capital reserve. 
However, if there is no clear evidence of bargain 
purchase, the entity recognises the gain directly in 
equity as capital reserve, without routing the same 
through OCI.
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost 
less any accumulated impairment losses. For the 
purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in 
a business combination is, from the acquisition date, 
allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units 
that are expected to benefit from the combination, 
irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the 
acquiree are assigned to those units.
A cash generating unit to which goodwill has been 
allocated is tested for impairment annually, or more 
frequently when there is an indication that the unit 
may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the 
cash generating unit is less than its carrying amount, 
the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the 
carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the 
unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata 
based on the carrying amount of each asset in the 
unit. Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognised 
in profit or loss. An impairment loss recognised for 
goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.
Where 
goodwill 
has 
been 
allocated 
to 
a 
cash-generating unit and part of the operation within 
that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with 
the disposed operation is included in the carrying 
amount of the operation when determining the 
gain or loss on disposal. Goodwill disposed in these 
circumstances is measured based on the relative 
values of the disposed operation and the portion of 
the cash-generating unit retained.

4.4	 	 Current versus non- current classification
The Group presents assets and liabilities in the 
Consolidated Financial Statement of assets and 
liabilities based on current/ non-current classification. 
An asset is treated as current when it is:
•	 Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or 
consumed in normal operating cycle
•	 Held primarily for the purpose of trading
•	 It is expected to be realised within twelve months 
after the reporting period, or
•	 Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from 
being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at 
least twelve months after the reporting period. 
All other assets are classified as non-current.
All other assets are classified as non-current. 
A liability is current when:
•	 It is expected to be settled in normal operating 
cycle
•	 Held primarily for the purpose of trading
•	 It is due to be settled within twelve months after 
the reporting period, or
•	 There is no unconditional right to defer the 
settlement of the liability for at least twelve months 
after the reporting period.
The Group classifies all other liabilities as non-current. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as 
non-current assets and liabilities.
The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition 
of assets for processing and their realisation in cash 
and cash equivalents. The group has identified twelve 
months as its operating cycle.
4.5	 	 Foreign currencies
The Group’s Consolidated Financial Statement are 
presented in INR (Indian Rupees), which is also the 
Holding Company’s functional currency. For each 
entity, the Group determines the functional currency 
and items included in the summary statements of each 
entity are measured using that functional currency. 
Functional currency is the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the entities forming 
part of Group operates and is normally the currency 
in which the entities forming part of Group primarily 
generates and expends cash.
Foreign currency transactions are recorded at the 
exchange rate prevailing on the date of transaction. 
Foreign currency rate fluctuations relating to monetary 
assets and liabilities are restated at the year-end rates. 
The net gain or loss arising on restatement/ settlement 
is recorded in Statement of Profit and Loss.
Non‑monetary assets and non-monetary liabilities 
denominated in a foreign currency and measured 
at historical cost are translated at the exchange rate 
prevalent at the date of the transaction. The related 
revenue and expense are recognized using the same 
exchange rate.
4.6	 	 Fair value measurement
The Group measures financial instruments such as 
derivatives at fair value at each balance sheet date.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell 
an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly 
transaction between market participants at the 
measurement date. The fair value measurement is 
based on the presumption that the transaction to sell 
the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:
1.	 In the principal market for the asset or liability, or
2.	 In the absence of a principal market, in the most 
advantageous market for the asset or liability The 
principal or the most advantageous market must 
be accessible by the Group.
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured 
using the assumptions that market participants would 
use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that 
market participants act in their economic best interest.
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset 
takes into account a market participant’s ability to 
generate economic benefits by using the asset in its 
highest and best use or by selling it to another market 
participant that would use the asset in its highest and 
best use.
The Group uses valuation techniques that are 
appropriate in the circumstances and for which 
sufficient data are available to measure fair value, 
maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and 
minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured 
or disclosed in the Consolidated Financial Statement 
are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, 
described as follows, based on the lowest level input 
that is significant to the fair value measurement as a 
whole:
1.	 Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in 
active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
2.	 Level 2 — Valuation techniques for which the 
lowest level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement is directly or indirectly observable.
3.	 Level 3 — Valuation techniques for which the 
lowest level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement is unobservable.
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the 
Consolidated Financial Statement on a recurring 
basis, the Group determines whether transfers 
have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by 
re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level 
input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.
External valuers may be required for valuation of 
significant assets and liabilities. Involvement of 
external valuers is decided on the basis of nature of 
transaction and complexity involved. Selection criteria 
include market knowledge, reputation, independence 
and whether professional standards are maintained.
At each reporting date, the finance team analyses 
the movements in the values of assets and liabilities 
which are required to be remeasured or re-assessed 
as per the Group’s accounting policies. For this 
analysis, the team verifies the major inputs applied 
in the latest valuation by agreeing the information 
in the valuation computation to contracts and 
other relevant documents. A change in fair value of 
assets and liabilities is also compared with relevant 
external sources to determine whether the change is 
reasonable.
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group 
has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the 
basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the 
asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy 
as explained above.
This note summarises accounting policy for fair value. 
Other fair value related disclosures are given in the 
relevant notes.
4.7	 	 Property, plant and equipment
An item of property, plant and equipment is 
recognised as an asset if it is probable that future 
economic benefits associated with the item will flow 
to the Group and its cost can be measured reliably. 
This recognition principle is applied to costs incurred 
initially to acquire an item of property, plant and 
equipment and also to costs incurred subsequently to 
add to, replace part of, or service it. All other repair 
and maintenance costs, including regular servicing, 
are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss 
as incurred. Where an item of property, plant and 
equipment comprises major components having 
different useful lives, these components are accounted 
for as separate items. 
The cost of property, plant and equipment comprises 
its purchase price net of any trade discounts and 
rebates, any import duties and other taxes (other 
than those subsequently recoverable from the tax 
authorities), any directly attributable expenditure on 
making the asset ready for its intended use, other 
incidental expenses and interest on borrowings 
attributable to acquisition of qualifying fixed assets 
up to the date the asset is ready for its intended 
use. Subsequent expenditure on fixed assets after 
its purchase / completion is capitalized only if such 
expenditure results in an increase in the future 
benefits from such asset beyond its previously 
assessed standard of performance. The Group 
depreciates property, plant and equipment over their 
estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. 
Depreciation methods and useful lives are reviewed 
periodically at each financial year end. The gain or loss 
arising on disposal of an item of property, plant and 
equipment is determined as the difference between 
sale proceeds and carrying value of such item, and is 
recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
4.8	 	 Intangible assets
Design, development and software costs are included 
in the balance sheet as intangible assets when it is 
probable that associated future economic benefits 
would flow to the Group. All other costs on the 
aforementioned are expensed in the statement of 
profit and loss as and when incurred. Intangible assets 
are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and 
accumulated impairment. The estimated useful life of 
an identifiable intangible asset is based on a number 
of factors including the effects of obsolescence, 
demand, competition, and other economic factors 
(such as the stability of the industry and known 
technological advances). Amortization methods and 
useful lives are reviewed periodically including at each 
financial year end.
Amortisation method: The Group amortizes intangible 
assets with a future useful life using the straight-line 
method over following period: 
Class of assets
Useful life 
Computer Software 
 3 years
4.9	 	 Investment property
Investment properties are measured initially at cost, 
including transaction costs. Subsequent to initial 
recognition, investment properties are stated at cost 
less accumulated depreciation and accumulated 
impairment loss, if any.
The cost includes the cost of replacing parts and 
borrowing costs for long-term construction projects 
if the recognition criteria are met. When significant 
parts of the investment properties are required to 
be replaced at intervals, the Group depreciates them 
separately based on their specific useful lives. All other 
repair and maintenance costs are recognised in profit 
or loss as incurred.
The Group depreciates building component of 
investment property over 30 years using written down 
menthod from the date of original purchase.

The Group, based on technical assessment made 
by technical expert and management estimate, 
depreciates the building over estimated useful 
lives which are different from the useful life 
prescribed in Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013. 
The management believes that these estimated useful 
lives are realistic and reflect fair approximation of the 
period over which the assets are likely to be used.
Though the Group measures investment properties 
using cost-based measurement, the fair value of 
investment properties are disclosed in the notes. 
Fair values are determined based on an annual 
evaluation performed by an accredited external 
independent valuer applying a valuation model 
recommended 
by

The difference between the net disposal proceeds and 
the carrying amount of the asset is recognised in profit 
or loss in the period of derecognition. In determining 
the amount of consideration from the derecognition of 
investment properties the Group considers the effects 
of variable consideration, existence of a significant 
financing component, non-cash consideration, and 
consideration payable to the buyer (if any).
Transfers are made to (or from) investment properties 
only when there is a change in use. Transfers between 
investment property, owner-occupied property and 
inventories do not change the carrying amount of 
the property transferred and they do not change 
the cost of that property for measurement or 
disclosure purposes.
4.10	 Depreciation of property, plant and equipment 
Depreciation is provided on the written down value 
method. The estimated useful life of each asset as 
prescribed under Schedule II of the Companies Act, 
2013 and based on technical assessment of internal 
experts (after considering the expected usage of the 
asset, expected physical wear and tear, technical and 
commercial obsolescence and understanding of past 
practices and general industry experience) are as 
depicted below:
Particulars
Estimated useful life (in Years)
Land and buildings
60
Furniture & fixtures
10
Computers
3
Office equipment
3-5
Motor vehicles
8-10
The residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and 
adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting 
period. Lease hold Improvements are amortised on a 
straight line basis over the lease period. 
4.11	 Leases
The Group’s leased assets primarily consist of leases for 
office space. The Group assesses whether a contract 
contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract 
is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right 
to control the use of an identified asset for a period 
in exchange for consideration. To assess whether 
a contract conveys the right to control the use of an 
identified asset, the Group assesses whether: 
•	 the contract involves the use of an identified asset 
•	 the Group has substantially all of the economic 
benefits from use of the asset through the period 
of the lease; and
•	 the Group has the right to direct the use of the 
asset.
	
	 a.	 Right of use assets
At the date of commencement of the lease, the 
Group recognizes a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) 
and a corresponding lease liability for all lease 
arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases 
with a term of twelve months or less (short-term 
leases) and low value leases. For these short-term 
and low-value leases, the Group recognizes the 
lease payments as an operating expense on a 
straight -line basis over the term of the lease. 
The right-of-use assets are initially recognized at 
cost, which comprises the initial amount of the 
lease liability adjusted for any lease payments 
made at or prior to the commencement date of 
the lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease 
incentives. They are subsequently measured at cost 
less accumulated depreciation and impairment 
losses. Right-of-use assets are depreciated from 
the commencement date on a straight-line basis 
over the shorter of the lease term and useful life 
of the underlying asset unless the lease transfers 
ownership of the underlying asset to the Group 
by the end of the lease term or the cost of the 
right-of-use asset reflect that the Group exercise a 
purchase option. The Group applies Ind AS 36 to 
determine whether a right-of-use asset is impaired 
and accounts for any identified impairment loss 
as described in the accounting policy below on 
“Impairment of non- financial assets”.
	
	 b.	 Lease liabilities
The lease liability is initially measured at amortized 
cost at the present value of the future lease 
payments that are not paid at the commencement 
date. The lease payments are discounted using the 
interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily 
determinable, using the Group’s incremental 
borrowing rates. Lease liabilities are remeasured 
with a corresponding adjustment to the related 
right of use asset (or in profit or loss if the 
carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has 
been reduced to zero) if the Group changes its 
assessment of whether it will exercise an extension 
or a termination or a purchase option. The interest 
cost on lease liability (computed using effective 
interest method), is expensed in the statement of 
profit and loss. 
Lease liability and right-of-use asset have been 
separately presented in the Balance Sheet and 
lease payments have been classified as financing 
cash flows. The Group has applied a practical 
expedient wherein the Group has ignored the 
requirement to separate non- lease components 
(such as maintenance services) from the lease 
components. Instead, the Group has accounted for 
the entire contract as a single lease contract.
4.12	 Revenue recognition
The Group has revenue from its clients. The Group 
recognizes revenue when it satisfies performance 
obligations under the terms of its contracts, and 
control of its services is transferred to its clients’s users 
in an amount that reflects the consideration the Group 
expects to receive from its client in exchange for those 
services. This process involves identifying the client 
contract, determining the performance obligations in 
the contract, determining the contract price, allocating 
the contract price to the distinct performance 
obligations in the contract, and recognizing revenue 
when the performance obligations have been satisfied. 
The Group through its platform allows transactions 
between the consumers of its clients and service 
operators enlisted with the platform. The Group 
earns revenue when the consumers of its clients 
utilize services such as Lounge Access, Meet and 
Assist, Airport Transfers, Food and Beverages, Door 
Step Baggage and Spa & Wellness either through the 
DreamFolks App, DreamFolks Card, Issuer’s Card, 
Issuer’s Website, Issuer’s web or mobile Application 
(App) or Interactive voice response (IVR). 
Revenue is recognised in the accounting period 
in which the services are rendered. A receivable 
is recognised when the services are delivered as 
this is the point in time that the consideration is 
unconditional because only the passage of time is 
required before the payment is due. Cash received 
before the goods and services are delivered is 
recognised as a contract liability. 
Financing Components: The Group does not expect 
to have any contracts where the period between the 
transfer of the promised goods or services to the 
customer and payment by the customer exceeds one 
year. As a consequence, the Group does not adjust any 
of the transaction prices for the time value of money.
Other income
Interest income from a financial assets is recognised 
when it is probable that the economic benefits will 
flow to the Group and the amount of income can be 
measured reliably. Interest income is accrued on a 
time proportion basis, by reference to the principal 
outstanding and effective interest rate applicable, 
which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated 
future cash receipts through the expected life of the 
financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount on 
initial recognition. 
4.13	 Retirement and other employee benefits
Employee 
benefits 
include 
provident 
fund, 
employee state insurance scheme, gratuity and 
compensated absences. 
Long-term employee benefits:
Defined contribution plans: The Group's contribution 
to provident fund and employee state insurance 
scheme are considered as defined contribution plans 
and are charged as an expense based on the amount 
of contribution required to be made and when services 
are rendered by the employees. 
Defined benefit plans: The Group has Defined Benefit 
Plan in the form of Gratuity. Liability for Defined Benefit 
Plans is provided on the basis of valuations, as at the 
balance sheet date, carried out by an independent 
actuary. The defined benefit obligation is calculated 
annually by independent actuary using the projected 
unit credit method. The present value of the defined 
benefit obligation is determined by discounting 
the estimated future cash outflows using discount 
rate (interest rates of government bonds) that have 
terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the 
gratuity. Remeasurement gains and losses arising 
from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial 
assumptions are recognised in the period in which 
they occur, directly in other comprehensive income. 
They are included in ‘Other Comprehensive Income’ 
(net of taxes) in the statement of changes in equity 
and in the balance sheet. Net interest is calculated by 
applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit 
liability or asset. 
The Goup presents the first two components of 
defined benefit costs in profit or loss in the line item 
‘Employee Benefits Expense’.

Short-term employee benefits:
The undiscounted amount of short-term employee 
benefits expected to be paid in exchange for the 
services rendered by employees are recognised 
during the year when the employees render the 
service. These benefits include performance incentive 
and compensated absences which are expected to 
occur within twelve months after the end of the period 
in which the employee renders the related service. 
The cost of short-term compensated absences is 
accounted as under: 
•	 in case of accumulated compensated absences, 
when 
employees 
render 
the 
services 
that 
increase their entitlement of future compensated 
absences; and
•	 in 
case 
of 
non-accumulating 
compensated 
absences, when the absences occur.
4.14	 Share based payments 
Employees (including senior executives) of the Group 
receive remuneration in the form of share based 
payment transactions, whereby employees render 
services as consideration for equity instruments 
(equity-settled transactions). The cost of equity-settled 
transactions is determined by the fair value at the 
date when the grant is made using an appropriate 
valuation model. That cost is recognised, together 
with a corresponding increase in share Options 
outstanding reserves in equity, over the period in 
which the performance and/or service conditions are 
fulfilled in employee benefits expense. 
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled 
transactions at each reporting date until the vesting 
date reflects the extent to which the vesting period 
has expired and the Group’s best estimate of the 
number of equity instruments that will ultimately 
vest. The statement of profit and loss expense or 
credit for a period represents the movement in 
cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning 
and end of that period and is recognised in employee 
benefits expense. 
When the terms of an equity-settled award are 
modified, the minimum expense recognised is the 
expense had the terms had not been modified, if the 
original terms of the award are met. An additional 
expense is recognised for any modification that 
increases the total fair value of the share-based 
payment transaction or is otherwise beneficial to the 
employee as measured at the date of modification. 
Where an award is cancelled by the entity or by 
the counterparty, any remaining element of the 
fair value of the award is expensed immediately 
through profit or loss. 
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected 
as additional share dilution in the computation of 
diluted earnings per share.
4.15	 Taxes
	
	 a.	 Current income tax
Current tax is the tax payable on the taxable profit 
for the year. Taxable profit differs from 'profit before 
tax' as reported in the Consolidated Statement 
of Profit and Loss because of items of income or 
expense that are taxable or deductible in other 
years and items that are never taxable or deductible. 
The Group's current tax is calculated using tax rates 
that have been enacted or substantively enacted by 
the end of the reporting period, in accordance with 
the Income Tax Act, 1961. 
Current income tax relating to items recognised 
outside Consolidated Financial Statement profit 
and loss is recognised outside Consolidated 
Financial Statement profit and loss (either in 
other comprehensive income or in equity). 
Current tax items are recognised in correlation to 
the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly 
in equity. Management periodically evaluates 
positions taken in the tax returns with respect to 
situations in which applicable tax regulations are 
subject to interpretation and establishes provisions 
where appropriate.
Advance taxes and provisions for current income 
taxes are presented in the consolidated statement 
of assets and liabilities after off-setting advance 
tax paid and income tax provision arising in the 
same tax jurisdiction and where the relevant 
tax paying units intends to settle the asset and 
liability on a net basis.
	
	 b.	 Deferred taxes
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized 
for the future tax consequences of temporary 
differences between the carrying values of 
assets and liabilities and their respective tax 
bases. Deferred tax assets are recognised for all 
deductible temporary differences and unused 
tax losses only if it is probable that future taxable 
amounts will be available to utilise those temporary 
differences and losses. 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is 
reviewed at the end of each reporting period and 
reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profits will be available to 
allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. 
Deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured 
at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the 
period in which the liability is settled or the asset is 
realised, based on the tax rates (and tax laws) that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
end of the reporting period. 
The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and 
assets reflects the tax consequences that would 
follow from the manner in which the Group 
expects, at the end of the reporting period, to 
recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets 
and liabilities. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when 
there is a legally enforceable right to offset current 
tax assets and liabilities and where the deferred tax 
balances relate to the same taxation authority. 
Current tax assets and tax liabilities are off set 
where the entity has a legally enforceable right 
to offset and intends either to settle on a net 
basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability 
simultaneously. 
Current and deferred tax is recognised in profit 
or loss, except to the extent that it relates to 
items recognised in other comprehensive income 
or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also 
recognised in other comprehensive income or 
directly in equity, respectively.
4.16	 Segment reporting
Operating segments are defined as components 
of an entity where discrete financial information is 
evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision 
marke (“CODM”) in deciding allocation of resources 
and in assessing performance. The Group’s Managing 
Director is its CODM. The Group’s CODM reviews 
financial information presented on a consolidated 
basis for the purposes of making operating decisions, 
allocating 
resources, 
and 
evaluating 
financial 
performance. Our business activity primarily falls 
within a single business and geographical segment, 
hence, the disclosure of segment-wise information is 
not applicable under Ind AS 108- 'Operating Segments'. 
4.17	 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is computed using the 
weighted average number of equity shares outstanding 
during the period. Diluted earnings per share is 
computed using the weighted-average number of 
equity and dilutive equivalent shares outstanding 
during the period, except where the results would be 
anti-dilutive. 
The number of equity shares and potentially 
dilutive equity shares are adjusted retrospectively 
for all periods presented for any splits and bonus 
shares issues including for change effected prior 
to the approval of the financial Information by the 
Board of Directors.
4.18	  Provisions and contingent liabilities
	
	 a.	 Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has 
a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a 
result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow 
of resources embodying economic benefits will 
be required to settle the obligation and a reliable 
estimate can be made of the amount of the 
obligation. The expense relating to a provision is 
presented in the consolidated statement of profit 
and loss net of any reimbursement.If the effect 
of the time value of money is material, provisions 
are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that 
reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the 
liability. When discounting is used, the increase 
in the provision due to the passage of time is 
recognised as a finance cost.
	
	 b.	 Contingent liabilities
Contingent liability is a possible obligation that 
arises from past events and the existence of 
which will be confirmed only by the occurrence or 
non-occurrence of one are more uncertain future 
events not wholly within the control of the Group, 
or is a present obligation that arises from past 
event but is not recognised because either it is not 
probable that an outflow of resources embodying 
economic benefits will be required to settle the 
obligation, or a reliable estimate of the amount of 
the obligation cannot be made. Contingent liabilities 
are disclosed and not recognised.
4.19	 Financial instruments
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to 
a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or 
equity instrument of another entity. Transaction costs 
directly attributable to the acquisition of financial 
assets or financial liabilities at fair value through 
consolidated statement of profit and loss are 
recognised immediately in consolidated statement of 
profit and loss.
1.	
	 Financial assets
All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value 
plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at 
fair value through consolidated statement of profit 
and loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the 
acquisition of the financial asset. Purchases or sales of 
financial assets that require delivery of assets within a 
time frame established by regulation or convention in 
the market place (regular way trades) are recognised 
on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Group commits 
to purchase or sell the asset.

	 a.	 Classification and subsequent measurement: 
Debt instruments that meet the following conditions 
are subsequently measured at amortised cost less 
impairment loss (except for debt investments that 
are designated as at fair value through profit or loss 
on initial recognition) (i) the asset is held within a 
business model whose objective is to hold assets 
in order to collect contractual cash flows; and (ii) 
the contractual terms of the instrument give rise 
on specified dates to cash flows that are solely 
payments of principal and interest on the principal 
amount outstanding.
Debt 
instruments 
that 
meet 
the 
following 
conditions are subsequently measured at fair value 
through other comprehensive income (except for 
debt investments that are designated as at fair 
value through profit or loss on initial recognition) 
(i) the asset is held within a business model whose 
objective is achieved both by collecting contractual 
cash flows and selling financial assets; and (ii) 
the contractual terms of the instrument give rise 
on specified dates to cash flows that are solely 
payments of principal and interest on the principal 
amount outstanding.
FVTPL is a residual category for debt instruments. 
Any debt instrument, which does not meet the 
criteria for categorization as at amortized cost or as 
FVTOCI, is classified as at FVTPL. Trade receivables, 
cash and cash equivalents, other bank balances, 
loans and other financial assets are classified for 
measurement at amortised cost.
Financial assets at amortised cost are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using effective 
interest method. The effective interest method is 
a method of calculating the amortised cost of an 
instrument and of allocating interest income over 
the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the 
rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash 
receipts (including all fees paid or received that 
form an integral part of the effective interest rate, 
transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) 
through the expected life of the debt instrument, 
or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net 
carrying amount on initial recognition.
	
b.	
Equity instruments:
The Group subsequently measures all equity 
investments in scope of Ind AS 109 at fair value, 
with net changes in fair value recognised in the 
consolidated statement of profit and loss.
	
c.	
Derecognition
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part 
of a financial asset or part of a group of similar 
financial assets) is primarily derecognised (i.e. 
removed from the Group’s Consolidated Financial 
Statement of assets and liabilities) when: i) The 
rights to receive cash flows from the asset have 
expired, or ii) The group has transferred its rights to 
receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed 
an obligation to pay the received cash flows in 
full without material delay to a third party under 
a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; and either (a) the 
group has transferred substantially all the risks and 
rewards of the asset, or (b) the group has neither 
transferred nor retained substantially all the risks 
and rewards of the asset, but has transferred 
control of the asset.
When the group has transferred its rights to receive 
cash flows from an asset or has entered into a 
pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if and to 
what extent it has retained the risks and rewards 
of ownership. When it has neither transferred nor 
retained substantially all of the risks and rewards 
of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, 
the group continues to recognise the transferred 
asset to the extent of the Group’s continuing 
involvement. In that case, the group also recognises 
an associated liability. The transferred asset and 
the associated liability are measured on a basis that 
reflects the rights and obligations that the Group 
has retained.
Continuing involvement that takes the form of a 
guarantee over the transferred asset is measured 
at the lower of the original carrying amount of the 
asset and the maximum amount of consideration 
that the group could be required to repay.
	
d.	
Impairment of financial assets
The Group recognises loss allowances using the 
Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model for the financial 
assets which are not fair valued through profit and 
loss. Loss allowance for trade receivables with no 
significant financing component is measured at an 
amount equal to lifetime ECL. For all other financial 
assets, expected credit losses are measured at an 
amount equal to the 12-month ECL, unless there 
has been a significant increase in credit risk from 
initial recognition, in which case those financial 
assets are measured at lifetime ECL. The changes 
(incremental 
or 
reversal) 
in 
loss 
allowance 
computed using ECL model, are recognised as 
an impairment gain or loss in the consolidated 
statement of profit and loss. 
The Group recognises loss allowances for expected 
credit losses on financial assets measured at 
amortised cost. 
At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether 
financial assets carried at amortised cost are credit 
impaired. A financial asset is ‘credit impaired’ when 
one or more events that have a detrimental impact 
on the estimated future cash flows of the financial 
asset have occurred. 
Evidence that a financial asset is credit impaired 
includes the following observable data:
•	 significant financial difficulty of the borrower or 
issuer;
•	 a breach of contract such as a default or past 
dues;
•	 the restructuring of a loan or advance by the 
Group on terms that the Group would not 
consider otherwise; - it is probable that the 
borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial 
reorganisation; or 
•	 the disappearance of an active market for a 
security because of financial difficulties. 
The Group follows ‘simplified approach’ for 
recognition 
of 
impairment 
loss 
allowance 
on trade receivables which do not contain a 
significant financing component. The application 
of simplified approach does not require the Group 
to track changes in credit risk. Rather, it recognises 
impairment loss allowance based on lifetime 
impairment pattern at each balance sheet date, 
right from its initial recognition. 
In all cases, the maximum period considered when 
estimating expected credit losses is the maximum 
contractual period over which the Group is exposed 
to credit risk. 
When determining whether the credit risk of a 
financial asset has increased significantly since 
initial recognition and when estimating expected 
credit losses, the Group considers reasonable 
and supportable information that is relevant and 
available without undue cost or effort. This includes 
both quantitative and qualitative information and 
analysis, based on the Group’s historical experience 
and informed credit assessment and including 
forward looking information. 
The Group considers a financial asset to be in 
default when: 
•	 the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit 
obligations to the Group in full, without recourse 
by the Group to actions such as realising security 
(if any is held); or 
•	 the financial asset is more than past due. 
The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is 
written off (either partially or in full) to the extent 
that there is no realistic prospect of recovery. This is 
generally the case when the Group determines that 
the counterparty does not have assets or sources 
of income that could generate sufficient cash 
flows to repay the amounts subject to write-off. 
However, financial assets that are written off could 
still be subject to enforcement activities in order to 
comply with the Group's procedures for recovery 
of amounts due.
	
2.	
Financial liabilities
Financial 
liabilities 
are 
classified, 
at 
initial 
recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value 
through profit and loss, loans and borrowings, 
payables, as appropriate. 
	
	 a.	 Initial recognition and measurement
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair 
value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and 
payables, net of directly attributable transaction 
costs. The Group’s financial liabilities include 
Borrowings, Other Financial Liabilities, Trade 
Payables and Leases.
	
	 b.	 Subsequent measurement
All financial liabilities are subsequently measured 
at amortized cost using the effective interest 
method or at FVTPL. For financial liabilities that 
are denominated in a foreign currency and are 
measured at amortized cost at the end of each 
reporting period, the foreign exchange gains and 
losses are determined based on the amortized 
cost of the instruments and are recognized in 
‘Other income’. The fair value of financial liabilities 
denominated in a foreign currency is determined 
in that foreign currency and translated at the spot 
rate at the end of the reporting period. For financial 
liabilities that are measured as at FVTPL, the foreign 
exchange component forms part of the fair value 
gains or losses and is recognized in profit or loss. 
	
	 c.	 Derecognition
The 
Group 
derecognizes 
financial 
liabilities 
when, and only when, the Group’s obligations 
are 
discharged, 
cancelled 
or 
have 
expired. 
The difference between the carrying amount 
of the financial liability derecognized and the 
consideration paid and payable is recognized in 
statement of profit and loss.
	
3.	
Offsetting of financial instruments
	
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset 
and the net amount is reported in the consolidated 
statement of assets and liabilities if there is a 
currently enforceable legal right to offset the 
recognised amounts and there is an intention to 
settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle 
the liabilities simultaneously.

4.20	 Impairment of non-financial assets
The carrying amounts of assets are reviewed at 
each balance sheet date. If there is any indication 
of 
impairment 
based 
on 
internal 
/ 
external 
factors, an impairment loss is recognised, i.e. 
wherever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its 
recoverable amount. 
For impairment testing, assets that do not generate 
independent cash inflows are grouped together into 
cash-generating units (CGUs). Each CGU represents 
the smallest group of assets that generates cash 
inflows that are largely independent of the cash 
inflows of other assets or CGUs. 
The recoverable amount of a CGU (or an individual 
asset) is the higher of its value in use and its fair value 
less costs to sell. Value in use is based on the estimated 
future cash flows, discounted to their present value 
using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of money and 
the risks specific to the CGU (or the asset). 
The Group’s corporate assets (e.g., office building for 
providing support to various CGUs) do not generate 
independent cash inflows. To determine impairment of 
a corporate asset, recoverable amount is determined 
for the CGUs to which the corporate asset belongs.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount 
of an asset or CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable 
amount. Impairment losses are recognised in 
the statement of profit and loss. Impairment loss 
recognised in respect of a CGU is allocated first to 
reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated 
to the CGU, and then to reduce the carrying amounts 
of the other assets of the CGU (or group of CGUs) on 
a pro rata basis. 
An impairment loss in respect of assets for which 
has been recognised in prior periods, the Group 
reviews at each reporting date whether there is any 
indication that the loss has decreased or no longer 
exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has 
been a change in the estimates used to determine the 
recoverable amount. Such a reversal is made only to 
the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not 
exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no 
impairment loss had been recognised.
4.21	 Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which 
they occur. Borrowing cost consist of interest and 
other costs that an entity incurs in connection with 
the borrowing of funds. Borrowing cost also includes 
exchange differences to the extent regarded as an 
adjustment to the borrowing costs.
4.22	 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalent in the consolidated statement 
of assets and liabilities comprise cash at banks and on 
hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity 
of three months or less, which are subject to an 
insignificant risk of changes in value. For the purpose 
of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash 
and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term 
deposits, as defined above, net of outstanding bank 
overdrafts (if any) as they are considered an integral 
part of the Group’s cash management.
4.23	 Cash flow statement
Cash flows are reported using the indirect method, 
whereby loss for the period is adjusted for the effects 
of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or 
accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or 
payments and item of income or expenses associated 
with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows 
from operating, investing and financing activities of 
the group are segregated.
4.24	 Events occurring after the balance sheet date
Based on the nature of the event, the group identifies 
the events occurring between the balance sheet date 
and the date on which the Consolidated Financial 
Statement are approved as ‘Adjusting Event’ and 
‘Non-adjusting event’. Adjustments to assets and 
liabilities are made for events occurring after the 
balance sheet date that provide additional information 
materially affecting the determination of the amounts 
relating to conditions existing at the balance sheet 
date or because of statutory requirements or 
because of their special nature. For non-adjusting 
events, the group may provide a disclosure in the 
Consolidated Financial Statement considering the 
nature of the transaction.
4.25 Functional and presentation currency 
The Group has determined the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which the Group 
operates, i.e., the functional currency, to be Indian 
Rupees (INR). The financial statements are presented 
in Indian Rupees, which is the Group's functional and 
presentation currency. All amounts have been rounded 
to the nearest Million up to two decimal places, unless 
otherwise stated. Consequent to rounding off, the 
numbers presented throughout the document may 
not add up precisely to the totals and percentages 
may not precisely reflect the absolute amounts.
4.25	 Recent accounting pronouncements
During the year ended March 31, 2024, Ministry of 
Corporate Affairs (MCA) has not notified any new 
standards or amendments to the existing standards 
applicable to the Company.

Estimation of fair value
The Company’s investment properties consist of two commercial properties in India.
As at 31 March 2024, the fair values of the investment properties are INR 24.55 Millions. These valuations are based 
on valuations performed by Ajay Kumar Sharma (B.E.), an accredited independent valuer. Ajay Kumar Sharma (B.E.). 
is a specialist in valuing these types of investment properties and is a registered valuer as defined under rule 2 of 
Companies (Registered Valuers and Valuation) Rules, 2017. A valuation model in accordance with that recommended by 
the International Valuation Standards Committee has been applied.
The Company has no restrictions on the realisability of its investment properties and no contractual obligations to 
purchase, construct or develop investment properties or for repairs, maintenance and enhancements.

Impairment of goodwill
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill has been allocated to the cash generating unit – ‘Golf CGU’. The recoverable 
amount of cash-generating units is determined based on a value in use calculation which uses cash flow projections based 
on financial forecasts covering a five-year period, and a adjusted the weighted average cost of Capital (“WACC”) of 25% 
per annum.
Cash flow projections during the forecast period are based on the same expected gross margins and inflation throughout 
the forecast period. The cash flows beyond that five-year period have been extrapolated using a steady growth rate of 5% 
per annum, which is the projected long-term average growth rate for Golf CGU. The directors believe that any reasonably 
possible change in the key assumptions on which recoverable amount is based would not cause the aggregate carrying 
amount to exceed the aggregate recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit. Based on impairment testing as above, 
the management believes that the recoverable amounts of goodwill are higher than their respective carrying amounts 
and hence no amounts are required to be recorded for impairment in the carrying amounts of goodwill.

Contract assets
A contract asset is the right to consideration in exchange for services transferred to the customer. If the Company performs 
by transferring services to a customer before the customer pays consideration or before payment is due, a contract asset 
is recognized for the earned consideration that is conditional. The contract assets are transferred to receivables when the 
rights to consideration become unconditional. This usually occurs when the Company issues an invoice to the customers.
Contract liabilities
A contract liability is the obligation to transfer services to a customer for which the Company has received consideration 
from the customer. If a customer pays consideration before the Company transfers services to the customer, a contract 
liability is recognised when the payment is made. Contract liabilities are recognized as revenue when the Company 
performs under the contract.

35	 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
	
Financial risk factors
	
The Group's operational activities expose it to various financial risks, including market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. 
The Group realizes that these risks are inherent and integral aspect of business. The Group continues to focus on a system 
based approach to business risk management. The Group’s principal financial assets include trade and other receivables, 
and cash and cash equivalents that derive directly from its operations.
	
The Group ensures that its financial risk activities which are governed by appropriate policies and procedures and 
that financial risks are identified, measured and managed in accordance with the Group's policies and risk objectives. 
Risk management policies are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group's activities.
A	
Market risk:
	
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of the future cash flows of the financial instruments will fluctuate because of 
changes in the prices of a financial instrument . The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in 
the interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that effect 
market risk sensitive instruments.
	
i.	
Interest rate risk :
	
	
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because 
of changes in market interest rates. The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates 
primarily to the Group’s long and short term borrowings obligations in the nature of term loan, cash credit facilities 
and working capital loans.

Foreign currency risk :
The Indian Rupee is the Group’s most significant currency. As a consequence, the Group’s results are presented in 
Indian Rupee and exposures are managed against Indian Rupee accordingly. Foreign currency risk is the risk impact 
related to fair value or future cash flows of an exposure in foreign currency, which fluctuate due to changes in foreign 
exchange rates. The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to the foreign 
currency transactions on account of global operations and transactions in foreign currency with its customers which 
is presently not significant in comparison to the total operations of the Group.

Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
	
The Company is principally exposed to risk against USD. Sensitivity of profit or loss arises mainly from USD denominated 
receivables and payables. 
	
As per management’s assessment of reasonable possible changes in the exchange rate of (+/-) 5% between USD- INR 
currency pair, sensitivity of profit or loss only on outstanding USD denominated monetary items at the period end is 
presented below:
USD sensitivity at year end

As per management’s opinion, the sensitivity analysis is unrepresentative of the inherent foreign exchange risk 
because the exposure at the end of the reporting period does not reflect the exposure during the year.

42	 DISCLOSURES AS REQUIRED BY INDIAN ACCOUNTING STANDARD 19 ON EMPLOYEE BENEFITS :
I.	
Defined contribution plans
The Group makes contributions towards a provident fund under a defined contribution retirement benefit plan for 
qualifying employees. The provident fund is administered by Employee Provident Fund Organisation. Under this scheme, 
the Group is required to contribute a specified percentage of payroll cost to fund the benefits.
Both the employees and the company make pre-determined contributions to the provident fund. Amount recognized 
as expense amounts to INR 7.79 Million for the year ended March 31, 2024 (for the year ended March 31, 2023: INR 5.37 
Million) under contributions to provident and other funds.
II.	 Gratuity
The Company have an obligation towards gratuity, a defined benefit plan covering eligible employees as per the Payment 
of Gratuity Act, 1972. However, other companies in the group are not making any provision in relation to gratuity as 
these companies have number of employee less than the number prescribed under Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 for 
apllicability. The plan provides for a lump-sum payment to vested employees at retirement, death while in employment 
or on termination of employment of an amount equivalent to 15 days salary payable for each completed year of service. 
Vesting occurs upon completion of five years of service. The gratuity benefits are unfunded.
Gratuity liability is provided for on the basis of an actuarial valuation on projected unit credit method made at the end 
of each financial year. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated 
future cash outflows by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting year on government bonds that have terms 
approximating to the terms of the related obligation.
III.	 Leave plan and compensated absences
The Group has a leave encashment scheme with defined benefits for its employees. The Group makes provision for such 
liability in the books of accounts on the basis of year end actuarial valuation. No fund has been created for this scheme.
IV.	 For summarizing the components of net benefit expense recognized in the statement of profit and loss and the funded 
status and amounts recognized in the balance sheet for the respective plans, the details are as under:

Employee Stock Option Plan 2021 namely “ESOP 2021” was adopted by the Board of Directors vide its resolution dated 
September 28, 2021 and by the shareholders vide its resolution dated September 29, 2021. Under the ESOP 2021, the 
Company granted stock options (“”Grant 1””) to the eligible employees of Company which will vest over a period of 3 years 
from date of Grant and are exercisable for a period of 5 years once vested.  . 
The Nomination and Remuneration Committee of the Company has approved further grants (“Grant 2 and Grant 3”) 
under ESOP 2021 with related vesting conditions. Vesting of the options would be subject to continous employment and 
certain performance parameters stipulated by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee of the Company. Hence the 
options would vest with the passage of the time on meeting the performance parameters. However, the above performace 
condition is only considered in determining the numbers of instruments that will ultimately vest. Options have been 
granted with vesting period of upto 7 years and are exercisable for a period of 5 years once vested.  
The fair value of the share options is estimated at the grant date using the Black- Scholes option pricing model, taking into 
account the terms and conditions upon which the share options were granted.
