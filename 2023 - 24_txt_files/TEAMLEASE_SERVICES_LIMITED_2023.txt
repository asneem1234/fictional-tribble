Business Responsibility and 
Sustainability Report
[As per Regulation 34(2)(f) of the SEBI Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements Regulations, 2015 read 
with Amendments]
The prism through which companies are being looked at, is rapidly 
changing. In the recent period, the resilience of companies has been 
tested in terms of how they have been able to withstand the turmoil 
of the COVID-19 induced pandemic. The other issue taking centre 
stage is a Company’s commitment towards Environmental, Social 
and Governance (ESG) parameters. Each Company’s experience on 
dealing with the pandemic is different as is each Company’s journey 
on ESG. For TeamLease Services Limited (TeamLease/Company), 
the pandemic has reiterated that there can be no greater security 
in life than having a job, a source of income. ESG links together all 
spheres of activity within TeamLease.
Due credit must be given to the Indian capital markets regulator, 
The Securities & Exchange Board of India (SEBI) for taking the lead 
in putting together the Business Responsibility & Sustainability 
Reporting (BRSR) framework. In response to the worldwide trends, 
SEBI, has adopted new sustainability reporting criteria as part of 
its ongoing efforts to improve ESG disclosures. This new, Business 
Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR), reporting format 
intends to establish ties between a Company’s financial outcomes 
and its ESG performance. This can help regulators, investors, and 
other stakeholders get a more accurate picture of a Company’s overall 
stability, growth, sustainability and transparency. It is a comprehensive 
framework, which calls for more measurable, quantitative metrics to 
facilitate better benchmarking. 
With effect from the Financial Year 2022-2023, ESG Reporting - as 
per guidelines provided by SEBI, India, i.e. Business Responsibility 
and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) is mandated for the top 1000 
listed companies (by market capitalization). The existing Business 
Responsibility Reporting (BRR) which is based on the National 
Guidelines for Responsible Business Conduct (NGRBCs) is 
succeeded by the BRSR. SEBI through a notification dated May 05, 
2021 has discontinued the requirement of submitting BRR by listed 
companies after FY 2021-22. As per the notification, TeamLease is 
required to submit a new report on ESG parameters, namely Business 
Responsibility and Sustainability Report from FY 22-23 onwards. 
At TeamLease, it was a collective decision to adopt the BRSR ahead 
of schedule from FY’22 onwards.
At TeamLease, we remain committed towards deepening our 
engagement with our stakeholders as we strive towards increasing 
Employment, Employability and E-workforce in the country.
As we all know, ESG- where E represents Environment; S represents 
Social and G represents Governance – These are the three core 
pillars to measure the sustainability, societal impact, and corporate 
governance, plus investment potential in a business/organization.

Key Elements of Sustainability and ESG:
At TeamLease, our ESG and Sustainability program is deeply 
influenced by our core values. It is informed by an understanding 
of  industry benchmarks and standards, stakeholder feedback and 
materiality. In addition, the Spirit of TeamLease values exemplify 
being responsible, respect for people and integrity.
We believe that sustainability is everyone’s responsibility. This 
responsibility permeates all levels, functions, and businesses, 
with many functions viewing themselves as crucial contributors 
to its success.
Creating value for stakeholders is the central reason for an 
organization’s existence. At TeamLease, our stakeholders are essential 
partners in our journey; whether it is employees, investors, customers 
or suppliers, their voices shape our decisions. Our stakeholder 
engagement is based on the bedrock of trust and stewardship helping 
us navigate the social, environmental and economic landscape in 
ways that are mutually fruitful.

The Company believes in meeting a critical social objective with an endeavour to provide job solutions across all income

The Company has been built on the founding principles of kindness, fairness, effectiveness and efficiency. The Company 
believes that sound principles of governance are a necessary tool for creating long-term value for all its stakeholders and to 
promote sustainability. TeamLease regards respect for human rights as one of its fundamental and core values. TeamLease 
undertakes its developmental and welfare activities directly. The Company recognises that climate change is not just an 
environmental issue but also a business risk. The Company is increasing its due diligence on ESG risks in its policies. 
Employee sensitisation on ESG risks is crucial. The Company discourages wasteful usage of natural resources.

Section C
Principle-Wise Performance Disclosures
Principle 1
Businesses should conduct and govern themselves with Ethics, Transparency and Accountability
TeamLease is committed to achieving the highest principles of integrity and ethics. Our Code of Conduct (COC / Code) outlines 
the Company’s expected standards of ethical conduct and behavior. Our core values represent mutual respect, trust and personal 
growth for all. The Code of Conduct extends to employees at all  levels  and  other  individuals  working  with  the Company,  its 
Subsidiaries,  associates,  suppliers,  service  providers, channel partners and explicitly prohibits bribes, kickbacks, improper 
payments and direct them to ensure ethical business conduct.
The three pillars supporting the governance structure of the Company are as under:
a.	
Ethics: In consonance with the Regulation 17 of SEBI LODR Regulations, 2015 (as amended from time-to-time), the 
Company has adopted a “TeamLease Code of Conduct and Business Ethics” which mandates the Directors, Senior 
Management and Employees of the Company to act honestly, fairly, ethically and with integrity, conduct themselves in 
professional, courteous and respectful manner.
b.	
Transparency: The Governance structure of the Company is further supported by a Whistle Blower and Vigil Mechanism 
Policy which serves as a tool for its directors and employees to report any genuine concerns about unethical behaviour, 
actual or suspected without fear of reprisal. The mechanism provides an avenue to stakeholders to raise concerns or 
violations pertaining to activities of the Company.
c.	
Accountability: In order to instil accountability amongst the employees of the Company and its Group Companies, 
TeamLease has in place an Internal Code of Conduct for Regulating, Monitoring and Reporting of Trades by Designated 
Persons. The Code serves a threefold objective of: 
 
 
monitoring the trades of designated employees of the Company; 
 
 
obligating the employees to handle price sensitive information of the Company on a need-to-know basis thereby 
avoiding leakage of information; 
 
 
mandating the employees to restrict unauthorized access to any individual other than the intended recipient of 
the information.

Principle 2
Businesses should provide goods and services that are safe and contribute to sustainability throughout their life cycle
While evaluating the impact of business operations, TeamLease aims to reduce any fallouts during the lifecycle of its services 
across the value chain.
A.	 Essential Indicators pertaining to Principle 2 
I.	
Three of our products or services whose design has incorporated social or environmental concerns, risks and/or 
services opportunities
	
Temporary Staffing, Permanent Recruitment, Regulatory Consulting are our offerings and none pose any environmental, 
social risk or concern.
II.	
For each such product,  details in respect of resource use (energy, water, raw material etc.) per unit of 
product(optional) stated below:
 
 
Reduction during sourcing/production/ distribution achieved since the previous year throughout the value chain:
	
	
Not Applicable.
 
 
Reduction during usage by consumers (energy, water) has been achieved since the previous year:
	
	
Not Applicable.
IX. 	  Details of the business continuity and disaster management plan of the Company.
	
The Company has a Board approved Business Continuity Plan (BCP). This BCP identifies core business functions and 
critical business sites that are covered under the resiliency programme. Most of the business functions are supported 
through automation with the help of technology. Hence, IT resiliency forms a critical component of BCP. Recovery Time 
Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO) are defined for all critical business processes. The IT Disaster 
Recovery Plan ensures that the defined RTO and RPO are met. The BCP defines the overall governance and monitoring of 
the business continuity function, including setting up of Emergency Response Teams (ERT) and Function Recovery Teams 
(FRT). Business continuity spans people, processes and technology. Requisite training programmes have been conducted 
for the teams to be prepared to respond in a crisis. Disaster drills and table top exercises are conducted at regular intervals 
to test whether the set procedures are working as defined within the pre-defined RTO and RPO and people understand 
and follow it appropriately.
23
III.	 Confirmation on procedures in place for sustainable sourcing by the Company	
	
	
Given the nature of the business of the Company, at a corporate level, consumption of resources is limited to running the 
operations. The Company, however, remains cognisant of reducing its resource consumption through ensuring better 
energy efficiency standards whilst procuring electronic equipment, lighting devices, computers, HVACs, sensors, amongst 
others. This initiative will bring in energy savings over the medium to long-term. At most of the Company’s offices, there are 
LED light fittings to conserve energy and conscious endeavours have been made to replace electronic equipment with high 
energy star ratings. Sensors are installed to economise power and water consumption only when these facilities are being 
used. The major suppliers of hardware are green standard compliant.
IV.	
 Confirmation on steps taken by the Company to procure goods and services wherever possible from local &small 
producers, including communities surrounding their place of work 
	
The Company endeavours to engage with suppliers who integrate environmental and social considerations into their 
products and services. At an all-India level, preference is always given to sourcing from local suppliers.
V.	
 Mechanism to recycle products and wherever possible waste by the Company
	
Given the nature of the business, the Company has limited scope to use recycled material as processed inputs. 
	
However, the Company has systems in place at an all-India level to manage and dispose dry/wet waste efficiently.
VI.	 Percentage of R&D and capital expenditure (capex) investments in specific technologies to improve the 
environmental and social impacts of product and processes to total R&D and capex investments made by the 
Company, respectively. 
	
Given the nature of business of the Company, the relevance of the above is largely restricted to information technology (IT) 
capex. In FY24, capex incurred towards IT hardware and software (including capital work in progress), which facilitated the 
enhanced digital initiatives of the Company was 0.17% of total revenue. Greater adoption of digital platforms not only brings 
in increased efficiencies of operations but also ensures substantially reduced consumption of paper.
B.	
Leadership Indicators pertaining to Principle 2
I.	
Status of conducting Life Cycle Perspective/Assessments (LCA) for any of its products (for manufacturing 
industry) or for its services (for service industry) 
	
This is not applicable to the Company. The Company does not have any physical products as a part of its offerings to 
customers. It is a  service based Company. Hence the applicability of life-cycle approach to the Company’s core operations 
is rather limited. Application of a life cycle approach is hence restricted to the services and products procured by the 
Company for its own operations. Most of the product categories procured are off-the-shelf items. Hence, the life cycle 
philosophy as extended to these include green procurement considerations as a part of the technical specifications for 
purchase and end-of-life management to maximize recycling.
II.	
Significant social or environmental concerns and/or risks arising from production or disposal of the products / 
services, as identified in the Life Cycle Perspective/Assessments (LCA) or through any other means.
	
It’s a service based Company providing various kind of services across the country. Therefore, no social or environmental 
concerns are associated with the use of its offerings.
III.	 Percentage of recycled or reused input material to total material (by value) used in production (for manufacturing 
industry) or providing services (for service industry).
	
Not Applicable, as Company does not have physical products as a part of its offerings.
IV.	
Reclaimed products and their packaging materials (as percentage of products sold) for each product category.
	
Not Applicable, as Company does not have physical products as a part of its offerings.
V.	
The products and packaging reclaimed at end of life of products, amount (in metric tonnes) reused, recycled, and 
safely disposed 
	
Not Applicable, as Company does not have physical products as a part of its offerings

Principle 3
Businesses should promote the well-being of all employees.
TeamLease believes that its success depends on its ability to develop knowledge, skills and expertise of its employees. This 
belief translates in ensuring that every business vertical is equipped  with  right  talent,  which  is both competent and engaged. 
The Company achieved this objective by undertaking various initiatives for talent development, employee engagement and 
communication. We have always been committed to inclusive and merit based policies. We are proud of the fact that the 
representation of women leaders in our senior team is at 38%. Our policies are for the benefit of all employees. In today’s world, 
the need for flexibility in terms of workplace (Work from home / work from office) is the most commonly mentioned and highly 
valued benefit and we are trying to create as much flexibility as possible without compromising on cohesion and team work. We 
have always had a transparent, merit-based and open culture. 
All our policies are geared towards equal opportunity. We pride ourselves on our compliance and ethical standards. All of these, 
put together create a work environment where everyone has a voice, has opportunities to grow and learn and take on higher 
responsibilities. Examples for this include our outcome-based performance management system, a promotion policy aligned 
with performance and learning opportunities for all our people.
We have monthly connect sessions with Department and Business Heads. People are encouraged to speak up and voice 
their thoughts, recommendations and suggestions. HR teams have regular connects with people to ensure that we are able 
to strengthen good practices and act proactively where gaps need to be addressed. There are CEO connect sessions for new 
joiners and senior leaders to ensure that transitions are smooth and there is a common language and culture of outcome 
based performance. We also have a cadence on Monthly, Quarterly and Annual Awards to recognize strong performance and 
adherence to our Principles. We have several recognition and connect activities to ensure that people have the resources and 
information they need to succeed and successes are recognized and rewarded. 
RETURNING TO OFFICE
At the start of the pandemic, many team members transitioned to working from home, allowing us to better protect both our 
team members who were required to come to our offices for essential operations as well as our team members who could 
perform their job duties remotely. As conditions improved in our communities around the country, we began enacting plans to 
return all team members to our TeamLease offices. We continue to adjust those plans, along with our Health & Safety protocols, 
to account for developments such as the emergence of variants. Recognizing that the needs of our team members have shifted 
over the course of the last two years, we remain committed to flexible work arrangements, and will continue to offer the option 
to work a combination of at office and remotely if the job allows. Hybrid working models give employees the benefit of in–person 
interactions with their colleagues while also enjoying the conveniences of working remotely.

XV.	 Details of performance and career development reviews of employees
All employees of the Company undergo an annual performance appraisal process as determined by the Company. Further, the 
Nomination and Remuneration Committee and the Board evaluates the performance of the Executive Directors, members of 
Executive Management (one level below the Board), Senior Management Personnel and the Company Secretary on an annual 
basis. The underlying philosophy of the performance management system is to have a fair and transparent system of appraisal, 
which ensures an objective mechanism to measure each employee’s performance and potential and implement a reward system 
which recognises merit. The performance appraisal system has been designed to achieve the following objectives: 
 
 
Review the previous year’s performance with specific reference to achievement of targets and give constructive 
	
feedback on performance.
 
 
Provide an opportunity for communication and interaction between the appraiser and appraisee regarding the 
	
previous year’s performance and setting of performance targets for the next appraisal period. 
 
 
Reward employees who have performed well during the appraisal period and those who demonstrate the ability to 
	
handle higher responsibilities with promotions/increased job responsibilities.

Principle 4
Businesses should respect the interests of, and be responsive towards all stakeholders, especially those who are 
disadvantaged, vulnerable and marginalised.
The key stakeholders identified include: Customers, Employees, Business Partners (Suppliers and Vendors), Community, 
Investors, Government Bodies, Industry Associations, Non-governmental Organizations (NGOs) and Academic Institutions. 
Our approach towards responsible and sustainable business practices undergoes a systematic mapping through regular 
engagement with its internal and external stakeholders. This practice helps the Company to prioritize key sustainability issues in 
terms of relevance to its business and stakeholders, including society and clients.
STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
Stakeholder feedback is an important part of our ESG strategy, helping us evolve our processes and culture, and while guiding 
services offered.
INTERNAL STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT 
We communicate with our team members through numerous platforms and channels, including town halls, meetings, the 
internet, internal messages, social media, blog posts, and newsletters that report on TeamLease’s sustainability efforts and 
other key business activities. We conduct confidential team member pulse surveys to gauge our team members’ views of the 
Company’s vision and strategy, the work environment, work relationships, and job satisfaction. 
EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT 
Throughout the year, we engage formally and informally with our stakeholders to explore ESG focus areas, along with trends 
and developments relevant to our industry. We endeavour to consider the views of our stakeholders when we make business 
decisions by acknowledging their viewpoints and demonstrating respect for our shared priorities. We believe this approach

A.	
Essential Indicators pertaining to Principle 4
I.	
Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the Company.
	
Any individual or group of individuals or institution that adds value to the business chain of the Company is identified as a core 
stakeholder. This inter alia includes employees, shareholders and investors, customers, channel partners and key partners, 
regulators, lenders, research analysts, communities and non-governmental organisations, suppliers amongst others.
	
At TeamLease, we have a systematic process for identifying key stakeholder groups. Here is an overview of its process:
Stakeholder Mapping: The Company conducts a comprehensive stakeholder mapping exercise to identify and categorise the 
key stakeholder groups relevant to our business. This process involves analysing the impact and influence of various individuals, 
organisations, and communities on our operations and vice versa.
Internal Consultation: The Company engages with its internal teams, departments, and leadership to gather insights and 
perspectives on stakeholders. This includes conducting workshops, meetings, and consultations to identify stakeholders who 
have a direct or indirect impact on its businesses.
External Engagement: The Company actively engages with external stakeholders through various channels, including surveys, 
interviews, focus groups, and public consultations. This enables TeamLease to understand its stakeholder’s expectations, 
concerns, and interests related to its operations and sustainability practices.
Stakeholder Mapping Matrix: Based on the information gathered from internal and external consultations, the Company 
developed a stakeholder mapping matrix. This matrix helps the Company to prioritise and categorise stakeholders based on their 
level of influence, impact, and relevance to its business.
Continuous Monitoring and Feedback: TeamLease believes in maintaining an ongoing dialogue with its stakeholders to 
keep track of their evolving needs and expectations. The Company regularly seeks feedback through surveys, feedback forms, 
meetings, and other channels to ensure that its engagement remains effective and meaningful.
31
Stakeholder Engagement Plans: Once the key stakeholders are identified, the Company develops tailored engagement plans 
for each group. These plans outline the objectives, strategies, and activities for engaging with stakeholders, considering their 
specific interests and concerns.
By systematically identifying and engaging with its key stakeholders, TeamLease aims to build strong relationships, foster trust, 
and align its business practices with their expectations. This approach enables the Company to address its concerns, collaborate 
on shared goals, and create long-term value for all stakeholders involved.
