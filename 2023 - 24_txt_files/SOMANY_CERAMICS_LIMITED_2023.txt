1
Compliance 
& Ethical 
Business 
Practices
Risk
Non-adherence to compliance and 
ethical business practices risks legal 
penalties, reputational damage, supply 
chain disruptions, loss of market 
access, investor and stakeholder 
distrust, and adverse environmental 
and social impacts.
Adhering to compliance and ethical 
business practices can pose risks 
such 
as 
increased 
costs, 
legal 
repercussions, market access barriers, 
and stakeholder concerns.
The 
Company 
maintains 
a 
robust 
compliance 
management 
system, with senior management 
regularly reviewing adherence to all 
regulations. To effectively mitigate 
compliance and ethical risks related 
to training on the Code of Conduct 
and Prevention of Sexual Harassment 
(POSH) 
policies, 
implemented 
a 
comprehensive, multi-modal training 
approach, engage employees at all 
levels, and foster continuous learning 
and leadership commitment.
Negative Implication
Non-compliance with 
regulations or unethical 
practices can result 
in legal penalties, 
reputational damage, 
operational disruptions, 
loss of market access, 
and fines, all of which will 
have negative financial 
implications for the 
Company.

2
Water 
Conservation
Risk/
Opportunity
Water management presents both 
risks and opportunities due to its 
limited 
resources 
and 
significant 
impact on the environment and society. 
Risks arise from potential water 
scarcity, increased regulatory scrutiny, 
and reputational damage resulting 
from 
unsustainable 
water 
usage 
practices. Conversely, effective water 
management presents opportunities 
for 
cost 
savings, 
enhanced 
environmental 
sustainability, 
and 
positive 
stakeholder 
engagement. 
By implementing responsible water 
management strategies, such as 
recycling and conservation measures, 
the Company can mitigate risks, 
improve operational efficiency, and 
contribute to long-term environmental 
and social benefits, thus ensuring 
sustainable business growth and 
resilience in the face of water-related 
challenges.
The Company has enacted numerous 
water conservation measures, such 
as 
process 
enhancements 
and 
wastewater 
recycling 
initiatives. 
Additionally, both its facilities in Kadi 
and Kassar operate as Zero Liquid 
Discharge (ZLD) plants, meaning all 
wastewater generated is recycled.
Negative Implication
Inadequate water 
management in a tile-
producing company 
can lead to increased 
operational costs, 
compliance expenses, 
reputation damage, and 
supply chain disruptions, 
negatively impacting its 
financial performance.
3
Energy & 
Emissions 
Management
Risk
The rise in energy costs and the 
enforcement 
of 
environmental 
regulations 
aimed 
at 
mitigating 
emissions underscore the financial risk 
associated with energy management, 
as it necessitates substantial energy 
consumption 
for 
processes 
and 
compliance measures.
Energy plays a pivotal role in driving 
economic 
growth 
and 
ensuring 
societal prosperity, with its availability 
and reliability being pressing concerns 
not only for organizations but also for 
global sustainability efforts.
The Company has enacted various 
initiatives, such as adopting energy-
efficient processes and systems, 
expanding the utilization of renewable 
energy sources, and transitioning to 
greener biofuels.
Negative Implication
Rise in energy cost and 
upfront capital investment 
for energy efficient 
technology.

Product 
Quality & 
Safety
Risk
The 
utilization 
of 
outdated 
technologies 
in 
tile 
production 
poses a risk to product quality and 
safety, potentially compromising the 
Company's brand reputation and 
profitability.
Offering a high-quality product at 
a competitive price, coupled with 
seamless 
pre- 
and 
post-sales 
service, presents an opportunity for 
organizations to cultivate satisfied 
customers 
who 
contribute 
to 
sustained revenue streams.
The Company prioritizes investment 
in research and development to 
deliver 
innovative, 
high-quality 
products to its customers, supported 
by an ISO 9001:2015 certified Quality 
Management 
System 
to 
ensure 
adherence to prescribed quality and 
safety standards for all its products.
Negative Implication
Poor product quality can 
lead to decreased sales, 
increased sales returns, 
reputation damage, legal 
expenses, recall costs, 
and lost opportunities, all 
of which have negative 
financial implications for a 
company.
5
ESG Aspects 
in Supply
Chain
Risk
Environmental and social risks within 
the Company's value chain may result 
in disruptions to the supply chain.
The Company has developed a 
Supplier Code of Conduct, which sets 
forth ESG performance criteria for 
all suppliers to follow. This ensures 
ethical, sustainable, and responsible 
practices across the supply chain, 
contributing 
to 
corporate 
social 
responsibility 
and 
sustainability 
objectives. 
Compliance 
fosters 
transparency, integrity, and mutual 
accountability.
Negative Implication
Negative ESG aspects in 
the supply chain can lead 
to financial risks such as 
supply chain disruptions, 
reputational damage, 
impacting the Company's 
financial performance.
6
Local 
Community
Development
Opportunity
Building lasting relationships with local 
communities is essential for gaining 
the approval to operate. By engaging in 
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) 
initiatives, the Company demonstrates 
its commitment to community well-
being and sustainable development. 
These 
initiatives 
include 
projects 
focused on education, healthcare, 
environmental 
conservation, 
and 
economic empowerment. Through 
active involvement and investment 
in local communities, the Company 
earns trust and support, enhancing 
its reputation and ensuring long-term 
viability.
Aligned with its Corporate Social 
Responsibility 
(CSR) 
policy, 
the 
Company consistently engages with 
local community members through a 
variety of CSR activities. These efforts 
are aimed at understanding and 
addressing the needs and grievances 
of the community, fostering a strong 
relationship and contributing to their 
overall well-being.
Positive implication
Local community 
development initiatives 
have positive financial 
implications for the 
Company by enhancing 
brand reputation, 
fostering customer 
loyalty, attracting and 
retaining top talent, 
improving relationships 
with local stakeholders, 
and mitigating operational 
risks, ultimately leading 
to increased revenue and 
profitability.

installed. These products are designed to last and typically do not require replacement for many years.
	
Regarding the plastics used in our packaging and distribution processes, we actively participate in the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) 
system. This approach is essential as the plastics used in our packaging can follow various paths that make direct reclamation challenging. Through 
the EPR process, we ensure the recycling, reuse, or recovery of these materials at their final disposal stage.

impact.

manage the recycling of plastic pre & post-consumer plastic.

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your company to reduce 
usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
	
Our waste management practices are robust and strictly adhere to the guidelines set by the State Pollution Control Board (SPCB) and the Central 
Pollution Control Board (CPCB). We manage hazardous waste responsibly, for instance, reusing ETP sludge as raw material and recycling plastic 
barrels, e-waste and used oil to SPCB-authorized parties. Additionally, broken tiles are repurposed back into our manufacturing processes.
	
We do not use any hazardous or toxic chemicals in our production processes. This proactive approach significantly reduces the potential generation 
of toxic waste.
	
For waste storage, we have designated specific areas to separately store hazardous waste and e-waste under lock and key, ensuring secure and 
compliant handling. For the transportation of waste, we arrange closed body trucks through authorized e-waste recyclers to ensure safe and secure 
removal from our facilities. Similarly, hazardous wastes like used oil are transported to recyclers in closed containers or drums, adhering to all safety 
and environmental standards.

Temp-Shield tiles, with their high Solar Reflective Index (SRI) value 
exceeding 90, not only reflect solar radiation effectively but also 
contribute positively to the environment. By maintaining cooler surface 
temperatures, these tiles reduce the heat island effect in urban areas, 
mitigate energy consumption for cooling purposes, and ultimately 
promote a more sustainable and comfortable living environment.
