Yes/No (If Yes, then give details of the mechanism in brief)
Permanent Workers
NLCIL is committed to maintaining a culture of open and transparent communication, creating an atmosphere where 
employees feel comfortable voicing their concerns to their business heads, the HR department, or members of the senior 
management. The company adheres to an open-door policy, ensuring that employees at all levels have the opportunity 
to engage with the senior management team. Furthermore, NLCIL has introduced the Corporate Whistleblower Initiative 
(CWI), which serves as an official channel for employees to report issues across a variety of topics. Information about the 
grievance process and the CWI is effectively communicated to employees through a specialized module, which includes 
awareness-sessions as part of the employee induction program.
Other than Permanent 
Workers
Additionally, NLCIL has established a thorough policy for the prevention, prohibition, and resolution of sexual harassment 
against women in the workplace, adhering to the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition 
and Redressal) Act, 2013. This policy is accessible on the company's website, and an Internal Complaints Committee 
(ICC), predominantly composed of female members, is tasked with investigating such complaints. NLCIL actively organizes 
workshops, group discussions, online training sessions, and awareness campaigns to educate employees about preventing 
sexual harassment at work, ensuring consistent and proactive involvement in addressing this crucial issue.
Permanent Employees
The steps for the grievance redressal mechanism are outlined as follows:
•	 Employees are required to lodge their grievances promptly using the specified format, and this should be done 
immediately or at most within three months from the date of the incident.
•	 To ensure swift, accurate, and efficient resolution of grievances, employees are classified into three distinct groups: (a) 
Workmen and Staff, (b) Supervisors and Executives, and (c) Executives at the level of General Manager and above. A 
dedicated Corporate Level Redressal Committee has been established for each category of employees.
The grievance handling process is divided into two stages:
I. Stage-I involves the employee presenting their grievance directly to the head of their Department/Unit using the 
designated FORM-I, following the proper channels. Upon receiving the grievance, the Department/Unit Head will engage 
with the employee to address the issue and will return FORM-I with comments or actions to be taken, within a 15-day period 
from the date the grievance was received.
II. Stage-II allows for an appeal process. If the employee is dissatisfied with the outcome or response received at Stage-I, they 
may appeal to the respective Corporate Level Grievance Redressal Committee using FORM-II. Appeals must be submitted 
in duplicate to the Committee’s Secretary and must include a copy of FORM-I, which contains the Department/Unit Head’s 
remarks or proposed resolution.

Study on Development 
of Hi-Tech Agriculture 
using Hydroponics / 
Aeroponics
In an effort to rehabilitate the land, an advanced agricultural setup employing 
hydroponics and aeroponics methods is being implemented. The main objective of 
this endeavor is to create a hydroponic farming system in the restored section of 
Mine-IA, which will be equipped with Internet of Things (IoT) technology to enable 
the live collection of data and monitoring of plant development.
In-depth studies suggest that this 
novel 
approach 
has 
significant 
potential 
to 
boost 
revenue 
generation while making effective 
use of scarce land resources.
3.
Activated carbon 
development using 
lignite – HA sludge
The creation of activated carbon from lignite and Humic Acid (HA) sludge is an 
important advancement in utilizing waste effectively and supporting environmental 
well-being. When humic acid is extracted, the leftover HA sludge is high in carbon. 
The idea is to convert this carbon-dense substance into activated carbon using 
a suitable method. Activated carbon is sought after for its extensive porosity and 
large surface area, which make it excellent for adsorbing impurities, thus making it 
valuable for water and air purification.
This initiative repurposes HA sludge, 
giving waste byproducts a valuable 
new use and diminishing their 
environmental impact. It offers 
a cost-effective and sustainable 
method 
for 
creating 
activated 
carbon, improving green waste 
management 
practices, 
and 
conserving resources.
4.
Lignite to Syngas for 
power generation 
The Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) technology transforms carbon-
rich materials into a hydrogen-rich synthesis gas (syngas), which is subsequently 
utilized to produce electricity in a combined cycle power station. This method 
enables the effective use of diverse carbon-based fuels and facilitates more efficient 
capture and control of pollutants compared to traditional coal or lignite-fired power 
plants. In line with this, a work order was issued to BHEL to conduct a feasibility study

5.
Development of eco-
friendly geo-polymer 
ash based green bricks 
using solar heating
The creation of environmentally friendly geo-polymer bricks made from ash and 
cured with solar energy presents a sustainable method for brick production. These 
bricks incorporate fly ash, a byproduct of thermal power stations, significantly 
decreasing their ecological footprint. By substituting traditional kiln firing with solar 
heating, the process cuts down on energy use and carbon output. This inventive 
method not only lessens the carbon footprint but also enhances the effective use of 
waste. These green bricks, which demand less water and raw materials, offer a more 
eco-conscious choice for building, aiding in the advancement of a more sustainable 
tomorrow.
Fly ash generated is utilized thereby 
ensuring waste management and 
environmental sustainability
5. Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan? Give details in 100 words/ web link. 
NLC India Limited has put into action an all-encompassing disaster management strategy, with the foremost aim of protecting the safety 
and health of employees at the facility. This strategy includes a variety of goals such as providing quick and effective emergency responses, 
reducing environmental harm, lessening the loss of property for both the facility and the nearby community, executing rescue missions, 
and administering medical care to those injured.
The disaster management strategy prepares for a broad spectrum of potential catastrophes, including natural phenomena like geological, 
hydrological, climatic, and atmospheric events, as well as human-induced disasters of a sociological or technological kind. The primary goal 
of this strategy is to promote a forward-thinking, comprehensive, and coordinated approach to enhance readiness for disasters, lessen their 
impact, and improve emergency reactions in case of unexpected crises. It acts as an extensive guide and reference for power sector utilities, 
addressing all aspects of the disaster management cycle, as outlined in the “Crisis and Disaster Management Plan for the power sector.”
6. Disclose any significant adverse impact to the environment, arising from the value chain of the entity. What mitigation or adaptation 
measures have been taken by the entity in this regard?
NLC India Limited is taking several steps to reduce its environmental footprint, including the adoption of clean renewable energy sources, 
the use of Circulating Fluidized Bed Combustion (CFBC) and supercritical boilers, the practice of eco-friendly mining, and the installation 
of pollution control systems like dust suppression mechanisms, bag filters, and water jets/sprinklers.
The Company conducts regular assessments to monitor the effectiveness of these green initiatives in reducing environmental stress. 
The results of these assessments are communicated to regulatory bodies through various reports such as Environmental Statements, 
Environmental Compliance reports, and Fly Ash Reports. Some of these reports, including the Fly Ash Reports, are also accessible on 
NLCIL’s website for public viewing.
NLCIL is actively contributing to the resolution of global environmental challenges by undertaking numerous projects. A key focus is 
expanding the renewable energy capacity to significantly cut down on greenhouse gas emissions. NLCIL has made strides in this area by 
installing 1,380.06 MW of solar power capacity and 51 MW of wind power capacity, thereby reinforcing its commitment to renewable 
energy.
To address pollution from its thermal power projects, NLCIL has introduced environmental safeguards such as high stacks for the dispersion 
of gaseous and particulate emissions, electrostatic precipitators for dust management, and the commencement of flue gas desulfurization 
(FGD) processes to limit sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions.
In the mining operations, NLCIL has adopted environmental protection measures like water sprinklers for dust suppression and the creation 
of lush green belts along the roads within and surrounding the mining areas.
NLCIL also prioritizes environmental education and has organized various programs on topics like environmental and pollution control, 
energy saving, co-generation methods, mining mitigation, and environmental impact assessment.
Through these comprehensive measures and initiatives, NLCIL is diligently pursuing environmental sustainability and fostering responsible 
practices in all its operational activities.

Principle 9: Businesses should engage with and provide value to their consumers in a responsible manner
Essential Indicators
1. Describe the mechanisms in place to receive and respond to consumer complaints and feedback. 
The Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) acts as the supervisory body for managing the tariff structures of power generation 
companies that are under the ownership or control of the Central Government. Power plants are mandated to lodge applications for tariff 
determination, which may include generating tariff applications, miscellaneous applications, or review applications.
When there are objections to the decisions rendered by the Central and State Electricity Regulatory Commissions, the Appellate Tribunal 
for Electricity (APTEL) steps in as a specialized appellate authority with expertise across multiple disciplines. Established in 2005, APTEL’s 
primary responsibility is to adjudicate appeals, which are typically initiated by Distribution Companies (DISCOMs) or power generation 
stations, especially concerning disputes over capacity and energy charges that CERC may have rejected. The appeal procedure entails the 
filing of legal documents, known as pleadings, followed by a series of hearings. After the hearings, APTEL may decide to send the case back 
to the CERC for additional review and to ensure adherence to its directives.
