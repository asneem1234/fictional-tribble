industries, provided it meets acceptable calorific values. Internal hazardous waste is stored 
and disposed of in compliance with regulatory standards. Collected hazardous waste is sent to 
approved recyclers, reinforcing our commitment to responsible waste management.
Other Waste

Health and safety management system:
a.
Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Yes/ No). If
yes, the coverage of such system?
Yes, Safety is a non-negotiable tenant for the Company. The primary focus is on ensuring the well-being and safety of its
employees and workers in offices and plants across all locations. To achieve this, the Company has established regular
training programs that cover a wide range of areas, including general safety awareness, road transport guidelines, handling
hazardous substances or equipment, emergency response protocols, and periodic refresher courses. These training initiatives 
aim to equip the workforce with the necessary knowledge and skills to navigate potential risks and respond effectively to
various safety situations.
Further, to enhance the focus on safe project execution amid multiple ongoing projects, a Safety Observation and Resolution 
Procedure (“SORP”) was introduced as a supplement to the existing safety management systems. SORP ensures that any
high-risk observations made are promptly addressed and resolved on the same day of their recording. The Company has well 
established process of Design Safety Review (“DSR”) & Pre-Startup Safety Review (“PSSR”).
The Company has further extended its commitment to safety beyond its direct employees and ensures that subcontractors
working on the Company’s premises adhere to the same high health and safety standards that the Company upholds. This
approach guarantees a consistent level of safety across all activities taking place within the facilities.
b. 
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by 
the entity?
To thoroughly evaluate the risks associated with the identified hazards, the Company conducts a detailed risk assessment and 
prioritises risks based on their level of severity and potential impact on employee health and safety. This helps the Company 
allocate appropriate resources and prioritise control measures for high-risk hazards that require immediate attention.
Further, the Company has an in-house developed STARS (SHE Tracking Analysis and Reporting System) in which incidents
such as unsafe act, unsafe condition, near-miss etc. are  reported. The reported incidents are investigated in detail, and
appropriate corrective and preventive actions are implemented to prevent its recurrence.
c.

risks. (Y/N)
