Case Details
Name of the regulatory/ 
enforcement agencies/ judicial 
institutions
In connection with fine levied by NSE and BSE for non-
appointment of Independent Directors, as stated in the 
previous question, since the power to appoint Directors 
on the Board of the Company vests with the Govt. of India, 
acting through the Administrative Ministry i.e., Department 
of Telecommunications (DoT), Ministry of Communication, 
Government of India, therefore the Company has been 
requesting the appointing authority, i.e., DoT, for appointment 
of requisite number of Independent Directors. The Company 
has no control in the appointment of Directors. In view of the 
same, the Company had requested / is requesting the stock 
exchanges to waive off the said fines.
