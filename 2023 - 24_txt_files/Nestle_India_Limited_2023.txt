While your Company focuses on R&D testing and adaptation to local conditions, as a part of Nestlé Group and under 
the General License Agreements, it has access to and advantage of drawing from the extensive central R&D efforts and 
activities of the Nestlé Group. Nestlé Group spends substantial amounts and efforts in R&D and in gaining industrial 
experiences. It has therefore been possible for your Company to focus its efforts on testing and modification of 
products for local conditions. Improving and maintaining the quality of certain key raw materials continued to receive 
close attention. The ability to leverage the R&D expertise and knowledge of Nestlé Group, has helped your Company 
to innovate and renovate, manufacture high quality and safe products, improve yields, input substitution, sustainable 
sourcing, packaging and logistics to achieve more efficient operations. 
Furthermore, access to Nestlé R&D network helps your Company to use new process technologies that lower emissions 
and provide guidance on how the product development can achieve lower-carbon recipes by substituting ingredients 
while maintain key product attributes. Where possible, it also helps in upcycling agriculture by-products to reduce 
food waste and nutrient loss, while unlocking new revenue streams for the farmers. Consequently, the consumers 
perceive the products and services of your Company as high value for their money. This gives your Company the 
unique ability to develop products and solutions that are produced with careful consideration for natural resources and 
social impacts and for contributing towards environment sustainability. 
In addition to the above, the R&D organization helps to discover and develop technologies for more sustainable 
packaging to meet global commitment for all Nestlé packaging to be recyclable or reusable by 2025. The Nestlé

10.	 Health and safety management system:
a.	
Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Yes/
No). If yes, the coverage such system? 
Yes, your Company has implemented ISO 45001:2018 Occupational Health and Safety Management System.
The purpose of an occupational health and safety (“OH&S”) management system is to provide a framework 
for managing OH&S risks and opportunities, which includes prevention of work-related injury and ill health to 
people and to provide safe and healthy workplaces by eliminating hazards and minimize OH&S risks by taking 
effective preventive and protective measures. Your Company’s sites (includes nine manufacturing locations, sales 
branch offices, registered office, and Head office Gurugram) are covered under the scope of the ISO 45001: 
2018 certification. Nestlé is a company founded on caring: for our consumers, the communities in which we 
operate, and most fundamentally our people. Your Company believes that sustainable success can be reached 
193
only through people. No other asset in your Company is as important as the people who contribute with their 
work to the culture and business results. It is for this reason that safety & health is a fundamental value of our 
Company, and that we take the position that nothing we do at work is worth the risk of getting hurt. This is why 
we say at Nestlé that “one accident is one too many” and that for work-related injuries and illnesses, our ultimate 
goal is Zero. Therefore, your Company devotes adequate time and resources to protect employees, contractors 
and visitors at all its factories and over the past few years, we have expanded the scope of our S&H program 
beyond Operations, because we believe that we should apply the same standards of care to every employee in 
Nestlé, regardless of which part of the business they work in. Progressively we will seek to positively influence 
the S&H of others throughout our value chain, bringing broader benefits to our business and the communities in 
which we operate.
b.	
What are the processes used to identify work­ related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine 
basis by the entity? 
Risk assessment is at the very heart of our Nestlé Safety & Health Management System. It is the principal proactive 
management process, the one by which we identify hazards, determine how to protect people, and prioritize 
improvement actions. Your Company is constantly improving the performance by designing and adapting 
processes, work practices and systems in the direction of enhanced safety and health. It identifies that people 
involvement is indispensable to establish and maintain safety and health in the workplace. Respect of safety 
principles, standards and procedures is a condition of employment. Employees are responsible for working in 
a safe manner to prevent injury to themselves, colleagues, and other persons. They are encouraged to become 
actively involved in programmes to improve health and safety performance in the workplace.
Your Company uses several processes to identify work-related hazards and assess risks in a routine manner, 
some of which are mentioned below: 
	
1.	
HIRAO (Hazard identification and Risk Assessment Opportunity) is an element of ISO 45001. This is further 
enhanced with several specific risk assessments such as 
 
 
Machinery risk assessment
 
 
Task specific risk assessment. 
 
 
Material Handling Equipment Risk Assessment
 
 
Facility Risk Assessment
 
 
Noise assessment
 
 
Ergonomics risk assessment etc.
2.	
Permit to work Management system: A management process to identify and mitigate the risk for the routine 
and non-routine activities involving a high hazard task. More effective management of fatality & serious 
injury risks remains a top priority, and the permit-to-work process is one of the most important elements in 
a site’s S&H management system. It provides a final opportunity for Nestlé to ensure that high hazard tasks 
(e.g., work at height, confined space entry) are conducted safely, and is particularly relevant to contractor 
management and capital projects. This includes a risk prediction tool, which guides the performing authority 
to consider all risks and mitigating measures before start of the job.
3.	
Method statements: A process to establish detailed methodological approach of mitigating risk while 
undertaking a critical non-routine activity. This is particularly useful for capital investment projects where 
the scope of activities includes large scale civil construction and installation of heavy equipment.
4.	
ATEX (Atmospheric Explosion prevention management tool): A tool being used to identify the process 
hazards associated with manufacturing of powders and establishing the risk mitigating measures.
5.	
PESIS (The preliminary environmental & workplace safety impact study): A tool used for new product 
development where new processes/equipment changes or added. Identifying the S&H risk and enabling the 
risk mitigating control.
6.	
User Requirement specifications in Capital Investment Projects: Specific to the machineries and process 
Safety, safety Inputs are inbuilt into the User Requirement specifications and duly validated through the 
process of Factory Acceptance and Site acceptance tests etc.
Nestlé India Limited  |  Annual Report 2023-24
194
7.	
Shift risk prediction tool: Manufacturing lines have the concept of being risk assessed on shift basis using 
a concept of traffic light (Red, Amber & Green) so that people in the shift are aware of the level of risk 
associated with the shift.
8.	
S&H Tagging: A tool for identifying the workplace hazards on a proactive basis. 
9.	
Behavioral Feedback System (BFS): We believe that behaviour is the key to our success. Managers, team 
leaders and employees understand and are expected to live our S&H values every day. We challenge 
ourselves more systematically against these expectations and integrate these behaviours into our daily lives. 
Behavioral observation & feedback programmes will continue to play a key role in supporting behavioral 
change, so it is important we continue to enhance the quality of our programmes.
10.	 Contractor Field safety audits: Tool to conduct a joint inspection of project site along with the contractors 
so that good citizens can be recognized as well as violations can be captured and proactively mitigated to 
prevent any harm.
c.	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from 
such risks. (Y/N) 
	
Yes. Various systems and processes are laid down to identify and report work related hazards:
1.	
Behavioral feedback Sessions (BFS): Primary focus on identification of unsafe conditions, safe & unsafe 
behaviors, and one-to- one coaching sessions to improve behaviors. The BFS forms are available both in 
hard copy and digitally in most locations. 
2.	
GEMBA: Gemba is the Japanese term "genchi genbutsu" that is perceived to be comparable to management 
by walking around. Your Company has systems in place for regular safety tours by top management to 
the workplace. Primary focus while doing Gemba is on identification of unsafe conditions (through safety 
walks). This not only complements the process of BFS but also provides an opportunity to the workers to be 
able to engage with the management and provide feedback regarding any unsafe work conditions.
3.	
Safety Committee Meetings: The Safety Committee provides a forum for workers and management to 
work together to resolve health and safety issues. The Safety Committee consists of fair representation of 
management representatives and workers. Safety Committee meeting is also done with the contractors at 
most sites to provide them another forum for reporting unsafe conditions.
4.	
Safety campaigns: Through the safety campaigns, employees and contractors are engaged in different 
activities for awareness, identification of hazards and rewarding the team. This also provides them an 
opportunity to share any feedback for workplace safety improvements. 
5.	
‘Speak up’ platform for raising concerns.
6.	
Periodic internal audits/assessments. 
7.	
Through participation in incident investigations; and
8.	
Daily operations review/weekly operations review meetings.
d.	
Do the employees/worker of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services? 
(Yes/No) 
	
Yes, the employees/workers of your Company have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services. 
They are insured under the Group Health Insurance Policy (GHIP). A digital medical assistance app is also 
provided to all eligible employees and their family members.
11.

Detailed investigations are carried out for all accidents to identify the root causes and to understand the measures 
to prevent recurrence. The learnings from all accidents are disseminated across the organisation, and a formal 
compliance is also obtained.

4. Our reasonable assurance engagement is with respect to the period from 01 January 2023 to 31 
March 2024 information only unless otherwise stated and we have not performed any procedures with 
respect to earlier periods or any other elements included in the BRSR and, therefore, do not express 
any opinion thereon. 
Criteria 
5. The criteria used by the Company to prepare the Identified Sustainability Information for the period from 
01 January 2023 to 31 March 2024 are the BRSR Core – ‘Framework for assurance and ESG 
disclosures for value chain’ and BRSR format, issued under SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (‘LODR Regulations’) read with SEBI circular SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD-
SEC-2/P/CIR/2023/122 dated 12 July 2023 (“SEBI Circular”) and the Guidance note for BRSR read 
with National Guidelines for Responsible Business Conduct Issued by Ministry of Corporate Affairs 
(“BRSR Framework”) (hereinafter referred to as ‘Criteria’). 
Management’s Responsibilities 
6. The Company’s management is responsible for selecting or establishing suitable criteria for preparing 
the Identified Sustainability Information, taking into account applicable laws and regulations, if any, 
related to reporting on the Identified Sustainability Information, identification of key aspects, 
engagement with stakeholders, content, preparation and presentation of the Identified Sustainability 
Information in accordance with the Criteria. This responsibility includes design, implementation and 
maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation of the BRSR and the measurement of 
Identified Sustainability Information, which is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or 
error. 
223
Reviews of Historical Financial Information (‘ISAE 3000 (Revised)’) issued by the International Auditing 
and Assurance Standards Board (‘IAASB’). This standard requires that we plan and perform our 
engagement to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Identified Sustainability Information are 
prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria.  
11. A reasonable assurance engagement involves assessing the suitability in the circumstances of the 
Company’s use of the Criteria as the basis for the preparation of the Identified Sustainability Information, 
assessing the risks of material misstatement of the Identified Sustainability Information whether due to 
fraud or error, responding to the assessed risks as necessary in the circumstances and evaluating the 
overall presentation of the Identified Sustainability Information.  
12. The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment and included inquiries, 
observation of processes performed, inspection of documents, evaluating the appropriateness of 
quantification methods and reporting policies, analytical procedures and agreeing or reconciling with 
underlying records. 
 
13. Given the circumstances of the engagement, in performing the procedures listed above, we: 
• 
Visited the corporate office at Gurugram and a manufacturing facility at Moga, Punjab for data and 
document verification;  
• 
Interviewed senior executives to understand the reporting process, governance, systems and 
controls in place during the reporting period.   
• 
Reviewed the records and relevant documentation including information from audited financial 
statements or statutory reports submitted by the Company to support relevant performance 
disclosures within our scope. 
• 
Evaluated the suitability and application of Criteria and that the Criteria have been applied 
appropriately to the subject matter. 
• 
Selected key parameters and representative sampling, based on statistical audit sampling tables 
and agreeing claims to source information to check accuracy and completeness of claims such as 
source data, meter data, etc. 
• 
Re-performed calculations to check accuracy of claims,  
• 
Reviewed data from independent sources, wherever available,  
• 
Reviewed data, information about sustainability performance indicators and statements in the 
report. 
Inherent limitations 
7. The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure 
non-financial information allows for different, but acceptable, measures and measurement techniques 
and can affect comparability between entities.  
Auditor’s Independence and Quality Control 
8. We are independent of the Company and have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance 
with the requirements of the International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued by the 
International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ (‘IESBA’) and have the required competencies 
and experience to conduct this assurance engagement. 
9. Our firm applies International Standard on Quality Management (ISQM) 1, “Quality Management for 
Firms that Perform Audits or Reviews of Financial Statements, or Other Assurance or Related Services 
Engagements” and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including 
documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional 
standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. 
Auditor’s Responsibility  
10. Our responsibility is to express a reasonable assurance in the form of an opinion on the Identified 
Sustainability Information based on the procedures we have performed and evidence we have obtained. 
We conducted our reasonable assurance engagement in accordance with the International Standard 
on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised), “Assurance Engagements other than Audits or 
Nestlé India Limited  |  Annual Report 2023-24
