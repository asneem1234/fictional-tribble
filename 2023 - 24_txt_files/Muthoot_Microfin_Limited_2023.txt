Digitization 
-Innovation
Opportunity
Muthoot 
Microfin 
Limited 
(MML) 
takes 
advantage of every possibility that comes with 
the latest developments for digital financial 
services solutions, such as disbursement and 
collections, in order to facilitate easiness in 
operational processes, data security and to 
enhance productivity.
-
Positive 
Digitization could help MML 
in automating the procedure, 
minimizing expenses, improving 
accuracy, 
and 
guaranteeing 
timely processing. In the end, 
this will increase data security 
and productivity, which will raise 
profitability.
2
Financial 
Inclusion
Opportunity
We have a mission “To become the most 
innovative and successful financial institution 
serving the life cycle needs of the underserved,” 
MML- 
A 
microfinance 
organization 
with 
operations in 19 states and UT, assists the more 
underprivileged and underserved segments 
of society and has played a significant role in 
advancing financial inclusion in India.
The term “microfinance,” for MML, refers to 
incredibly small loans given to self-sufficient 
women in rural and semi-urban areas with the 
intention of raising their standard of living.
-
Positive Growth potential can be 
unlocked by offering creative, 
customer-focused 
financial 
services and products to female 
entrepreneurs who do not have 
access to the formal banking 
system.

Lending 
Practices
Opportunity
The independent credit underwriting vertical 
evaluates 
household-level 
income 
and 
obligations at the Credit Bureau information 
level in addition to historical data and repayment 
patterns with MML and other FIs. Meeting in 
person before approving the borrower’s loan 
helps to evaluate the applicant’s eligibility, 
ascertain the loan amount, and minimise the 
reliance on unofficial data only for assessment 
and it helps to limit delinquency.
-
Positive
With 
well-defined 
policies, 
procedures, and processes in 
place, MML adheres to stringent 
loan eligibility requirements that 
give top priority to evaluations of 
household income, expenses, 
FOIR, 
Credit 
Bureau 
data, 
repayment patterns, and the 
applicant’s 
creditworthiness. 
By adhering to the credit 
underwriting 
framework, 
a 
comprehensive evaluation of 
borrowers is conducted at the 
household level. Eligibility is 
then fixed based on risk-based 
scoring, it helps for maintaining 
improved portfolio quality.

Human 
Capital 
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk:
Challenges in retaining employees causes 
difficulties in attaining business objectives, 
lesser productivity, maintaining quality portfolio. 
Opportunity: 
Performance can be improved by implementing 
effective 
practices 
such 
as 
providing 
opportunities for learning and growth, paying the 
competitive wages in the sector, guaranteeing a 
better work-life balance, providing chances to 
develop talent and skills, and creating a clear 
succession plan.
This will encourage them to offer their best 
effort, which will boost productivity, lower 
employee churn, and change the organization’s 
work culture.
In 
order 
to 
provide 
employees with a positive 
work environment and 
culture that enhances 
their 
experience 
and 
fosters employee loyalty, 
a 
strong 
system 
of 
personnel development 
and 
management 
is 
in place. This system 
allows 
employees 
to 
look forward to the next 
level of career growth 
opportunities.
Negative
Not maintaining human resource 
for long term may lead to 
lesser 
productivity, 
increased 
recruitment 
cost, 
and 
lesser 
business achievements. 
Positive
Improving 
employee 
values 
through growth opportunities 
for learning will result in higher 
retention 
rates, 
which 
will 
support sustained corporate 
expansion.

Data Security 
Risk
 Risk
The presence of adequate and proven 
data 
security 
measures 
strengthens 
the 
dependability 
and 
confidence 
that 
stakeholders, 
investors, 
banks, 
financial 
institutions,

and 
statutory 
agencies, and customers have in the IT

Regulatory 
and Statutory 
Compliance
 Risk
As part of improved governance, NBFCs are 
subject to an increase in regulatory reporting 
and compliance requirements in order to 
guarantee fair lending standards that align with 
banking standards and to gain over investors 
and clients.
 Well defined processes, 
procedures, 
policies, 
frameworks and system 
controls 
ensure 
that 
there are no regulatory 
and 
statutory 
non-
compliances arising. To 
ensure compliance with 
regulations 
and 
legal 
requirements, 
MML 
reviews 
its 
products, 
procedures, 
policies, 
and control mechanisms 
through 
internal 
and 
external assurance and 
self-evaluation 
tests 
as well as by Board 
committees.
Negative                
Non-Compliance of regulatory 
and 
statutory 
requirements 
will 
lead 
to 
financial 
and 
reputational risks.
7
Fraud Risk 
Management
Risk
The threat of fraud and monetary theft is 
highest for NBFC MFIs, which makes fraud risk 
management important. Fraud and deliberate 
misappropriation will cause loss of money, 
damage of company’s reputation, and turn out 
investors, Customers and lenders.	
Robust 
fraud 
risk 
management 
followed 
by in house internal audit 
and 
external 
internal 
Audit helps us to ensure 
conducting internal audit 
in regular intervals	
Negative                 
Non-Compliance of regulatory 
and 
statutory 
requirements 
will 
lead 
to 
financial 
and 
reputational risks.
8
Climate 
Change
Risk
Climate change raises potential risks that 
could disrupt the economy and have negative 
financial effects on financial institutions. Climate 
change-related uncertainty and severity pose 
an imminent risk to entities' resilience, safety of 
assets and human resources, and reputation 
and rising impairment cost.
A client can be protected 
against 
the 
financial 
impact 
of 
natural 
disasters such as floods, 
torrential rains, cyclones, 
heat waves, etc., with 
an insurance policy that 
covers damage to their 
home and appliances 
etc. Extending the revival 
support further will assist 
in reviving the clients' 
revenue-generating 
activities.
Negative
The uncertainty and severity 
of climate change present an 
immediate risk to an entity’s 
reputation, safety of assets 
and human resources, impair 
the value of assets held by 
customers and its resilience.
9
Risk 
Management 
- Enterprise 
Level
 Opportunity
The 
enterprise-level 
risk 
management 
framework of a financial institution is vital and 
significant for all parties that benefit from the 
business, including clients and stakeholders. 
The risk management function is independent 
in its responsibilities and reports to the board’s 
Risk Management Committee. MML is now 
engaged in the evaluation of environmental 
risks impacting the business directly.	
-
Positive                    
In particular, credit risk and 
operational risk are evaluated 
by 
the 
company, 
and 
all 
significant risks are reassessed 
on a regular basis to determine 
the 
efficacy 
of 
mitigation 
strategies and identify any gaps 
in them, if any, and to implement 
further control measures.
10
Corporate 
Governance 
and Ethics
Risk
Key governance elements like culture, such 
as owners, management, control, accounting, 
ethics, and transparency, are used to evaluate 
business and its values. Corporate governance 
assesses the impact of ethical behaviour and 
fair practices on stakeholders as well. 	
Implementing 
well-
defined 
internal 
control 
mechanisms, 
excellent 
governance 
practices, 
prompt 
adherence to standards, 
transparency 
in 
all 
dealings, 
compliance, 
and an effective risk 
management system are 
the cornerstones of good 
corporate governance in 
MML.
Negative             
Wrong 
perceptions 
about 
corporate 
governance 
may 
have 
negative 
impacts 
on 
businesses.

We are now promoting solar inverters in our branches and have implemented solar inverters in 3% of our total branches.

We have replaced 85% of laser printers in branches with inkjet printers. Inkjet printers typically generate less waste

waste. We have also reduced our paper usage by 87%. The significant reduction in paper usage minimizes deforestation 
and reduces waste generation, leading to the conservation of natural resources.
