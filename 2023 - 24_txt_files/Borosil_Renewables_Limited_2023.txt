change by reducing 
our carbon footprint. 
We are investing in

factory operations. 
Negative:
Climate change 
related impacts are

to supply chain 
disruptions and 
inventory losses. This 
could have a direct 
negative impact on the
Company’s revenue.
Positive: 
Climate change also 
presents a crucial 
opportunity for 
us due to increasing

Climate change 
poses substantial risks 
to our business in the 
short,

term, including severe 
weather events, water 
shortages, and supply

Responsible 
business practices are 
vital for long-term

we face potential 
regulatory and 
market challenges 
such as changing 
consumer

E-Waste
E-waste generated in factory is stored at designated areas and then it is sent to Gujarat 
Pollution Control Board (GPCB) authorized E-waste recyclers for further processing. 
E-waste generation and disposal records (Form Number 06) are maintained for 
monitoring purposes as per GPCB guidelines.

Hazardous Waste
We designate specific areas for storing hazardous waste, including empty bags, 
contaminated containers, and used spent oil, using closed sheds and secondary 
containment systems to prevent spills. Each storage chamber is clearly marked with 
appropriate signage, and spill kits are available at the scrap yard. Hazardous waste is stored 
for no longer than 90 days. Handling procedures mandate the use of proper personal 
protective equipment (PPE), coverage under a Workers’ Compensation policy for all 
involved personnel, and prohibit hot work activities near the scrap yard. Critical hazardous 
material handling requires thorough briefings and documentation. Transportation of 
hazardous waste is strictly controlled, requiring manifests, compliance with GPCB 
guidelines, GPS-equipped vehicles, and end-user consent for reuse or recycling. Specific 
protocols are also in place for disposing of oil-soaked cotton waste, batteries, and plastic 
drums within stipulated timeframes.

conditions and filling in the Hazard Report form with the assistance of employees. Follow-up on actions/responses must be 
completed within an appropriate timeframe.
The newly joined employees, trainees and workers are not subject to this performance appraisal process. The permanent 
workers undergo appraisals under the performance and career review process, whereas non-permanent workers are evaluated 
under wage settlement procedures.
The details of the performance and career development reviews for employees are provided below:
87
INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2023-2024 
Procedure for reporting:
Note: This procedure does not prevent employees from exercising their right to refuse unsafe work, as defined under the 
Occupational Health and Safety Act.
When an employee identifies a safety 
hazard/concern, they should immediately 
report it to their supervisor.
If the supervisor is unable to resolve the 
concern, it should be escalated to the 
owner/manager.
The employee will be asked to document 
the concern, outlining the facts and the 
information requested.
The Joint Health and Safety Committee/
representative 
and 
the 
employee’s 
supervisor are responsible for keeping the 
employee informed about the progress of 
concerned resolution.
The supervisor will promptly address the 
matter, consulting with others if necessary, 
and inform the employee of the action plan 
to resolve the issue. The time frame for 
resolution will depend on the potential risk 
of the situation.
If 
the 
employee’s 
concern 
remains 
unsatisfactorily resolved after a reasonable 
period, they are encouraged to bring it 
to the attention of a member of the Joint 
Health and Safety Committee/Health and 
Safety representative.
All concerns will be thoroughly investigated, 
with a focus on gathering factual information 
related to the matter.
If the concern remains unresolved, it 
will be discussed in the Management 
Review Meeting (MRM) and the Safety 
Committee meeting.

Our treatment technology includes a Membrane Bioreactor (MBR) system with a capacity of 50 KLD, recently expanded 
with additional 5 KLD( 2 in No.) and 15 KLD(1 in No.) units. The process begins with chemical treatment to neutralize and 
eliminate contaminants, followed by biological treatment to further degrade organic matter & other pathogens of concerns. 
Once treated, the water is seamlessly reintegrated into our operations for various processes, effectively closing the loop on 
water consumption.
Our ZLD system exemplifies our unwavering commitment to environmental stewardship, ensuring sustainable and responsible 
water management. The recent capex investments to expand the MBR capacity by 5 KLD and 15 KLD further demonstrate 
our dedication to improving our water footprint.

The implementation of the HHO system 
with the SG1 Forehearth combustion 
system has been a major step, reducing 
Natural Gas (NG) consumption in the 
first phase, with plans to deploy the system 
across all Forehearths. 
Efforts to control dust and improve air 
quality, such as installing dedusting systems, 
hot air ventilation fans, environmental 
monitoring safety meters, and real-time 
dust monitors, help in maintaining cleaner 
air and lowering emissions. 
Furthermore, a substantial portion of 
renewable energy is utilized for captive 
consumption, contributing 25% of  the 
overall energy consumption. 
Additionally, modifying the HHO gas 
pipeline position and relocating the HHO 
generator to an air-conditioned cabin 
optimizes efficiency and enhances HHO 
gas generation. 
Optimizing lighting and HVAC systems 
with timers, automation, and energy-
efficient adjustments, along with exploring 
oxy fuel firing and waste heat recovery 
systems, demonstrates our comprehensive 
approach to reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions 
and 
fostering 
sustainable 
operations.
