1.
Emission and 
climate change
Electricity is the main source 
of fuel consumption in the 
manufacturing process, 
which is drawn mostly from 
conventional grids, resulting in 
high emissions. Additionally, 
physical distribution and the 
mid- and last-mile delivery of 
physical books and stationery 
have a significant carbon 
footprint. Misalignment with the 
global climate change targets 
can negatively impact business, 
as several B2B export customers 
may expect Navneet to go 
carbon neutral.
   Investing in solar power 
with a capacity of 724 
KWp and wind power 
plants with a capacity of 
4,8 MW offsetting close 
to 70% of our scope 2 
emissions
   Developing a green 
zone within the 
manufacturing 
locations. Currently, 
trees are absorbing 
460 tonnes of CO2 per 
year, offsetting close 
to 16% of our scope 1 
emissions
   Energy optimisation 
measures include 
periodic energy audits
   Active stack monitoring
2.
Transition to 
clean energy
By embracing renewable energy, 
Navneet not only reduces 
its carbon footprint but also 
demonstrates its commitment to 
sustainability and environmental 
responsibility. This transition 
aligns perfectly with Navneet’s 
customers’ sensitivity towards 
clean energy concepts, 
enhancing its reputation as 
a socially responsible and 
environmentally conscious 
company.

3.
Water and 
wastewater 
management
Water is one of the components 
in the production process, 
and due to rising water 
stress across the country, 
Navneet may experience 
operational disruptions due 
to water scarcity. Additionally, 
the manufacturing process 
produces wastewater that must 
be treated before it can be 
disposed of. Failure to comply 
with water quality regulations 
may result in additional costs 
related to regulatory compliance 
and mitigation efforts.
   Implementation of 
wastewater treatment 
plants to efficiently 
process water and 
mitigate environmental 
repercussions
   Integration of rainwater 
harvesting and storage 
systems in our primary 
manufacturing facilities
4.
Waste & 
hazardous 
materials 
management
Improper waste management, 
including hazardous and non-
hazardous waste, poses health 
and safety risks to workers 
and the community. Failure to 
comply with waste management 
regulations can have negative 
economic implications for 
organisations
Authorised vendors for 
the proper handling of 
hazardous waste, including 
e-waste.
5.
Diversity & 
inclusion
Embracing diversity and 
inclusion at Navneet unlocks 
opportunities, fostering 
creativity, innovation, and 
broader perspectives. It enriches 
our content, attracts diverse 
audiences, and strengthens our 
reputation as an inclusive and 
progressive organisation.

Employee welfare 
and engagement
Employee engagement 
fosters emotional ties to 
the organisation, boosting 
commitment and loyalty. 
Prioritising employee well-being 
leads to higher retention rates, 
productivity, and a nurturing 
work environment. Motivated 
employees deliver superior 
customer service, driving 
business success, decreasing 
retention costs, and reducing the 
risk of losing critical talent.
   Employee feedback 
surveys
   Yearly training and 
development calendar 
focussing on skill 
development.
   Regular team-building 
activities 
7.
Human rights
Human rights violations can lead 
to severe consequences such 
as legal penalties, tarnished 
reputations, and consumer 
boycotts. Exploitative labour 
practices or unsafe working 
conditions can diminish 
employee morale, trigger 
lawsuits, and erode trust, 
adversely affecting profitability 
and market competitiveness. 
Inadequate training and 
awareness regarding human 
rights among employees 
exacerbate these risks, 
underscoring the need for 
comprehensive education and 
compliance measures.
   Conduct trainings 
on human rights 
periodically
   Carry out due diligence 
and third-party audits, 
including several export 
customer audits

Sustainable 
sourcing
Failing to follow sustainable 
sourcing practices can have 
detrimental consequences 
for the Company and beyond. 
Sourcing from unsustainable 
suppliers may result in 
reputational damage as 
customers and stakeholders 
increasingly prioritise eco-
friendly practices. Moreover, 
neglecting to ensure ethical 
standards in the supply chain, 
such as preventing human rights 
abuses, child labour, and bribery, 
can tarnish the Company’s 
image and result in legal 
liabilities.
   Adoption of a supplier 
Code of Conduct
   Declaration of 
acceptance of the Code 
of Conduct before 
onboarding
   Periodic supplier site 
assessments
   Document validation, 
including importance 
certifications such as 
FSC, and ISO, among 
others
9.
Community 
development
Operating within the education 
sector, which offers numerous 
positive externalities, we have a 
valuable opportunity to engage 
with the local community, 
organise events, support 
educational initiatives, and foster 
relationships with customers 
and stakeholders. These efforts 
can elevate Navneet’s brand 
reputation, attract a wider 
customer base, and cultivate a 
loyal and supportive community 
network.
10.
Anti-corruption & 
bribery
Failure to effectively address 
anti-corruption and bribery 
risks exposes us to legal 
and regulatory violations, 
reputational damage, and 
financial penalties, among 
others.
   Implementation of 
a strong ESG Policy, 
upholding ethical 
standards and providing 
clear guidelines. 
   Grievance redressal 
mechanisms ensure 
prompt resolution of 
complaints, fostering 
transparency and 
accountability.

Data protection & 
privacy
Inadequate data protection and 
privacy measures could expose 
Navneet to data breaches, 
regulatory fines, and reputation 
damage. Breaches compromise 
sensitive information, harm 
customer trust, and result in 
legal consequences, which can 
further hinder operations, erode 
consumer confidence, and affect 
long-term competitiveness in 
the market.
Implemented a data 
protection policy that 
is shared with its 
stakeholders and hosted 
on its website. 
12.
Corporate 
governance
Poor governance can impact 
management, and result in 
ethical breaches, and financial 
fraud. It erodes investor 
confidence, triggers legal 
issues, and damages the 
Company’s reputation. As a 
result, decreased access to 
capital, reduced profitability, and 
a loss of competitiveness in the 
industry can be suffered.
   Diverse board of 
directors
   Robust internal control 
systems to prevent 
fraud and ensure 
compliance. 
   Dedicated ESG 
Committee and defined 
ESG Charter
13.
Responsible 
content
Navneet’s educational books are 
used by students and schools 
in various languages across 
the country. Failure to maintain 
responsible and quality content 
standards can lead to serious 
consequences. It can damage 
the reputation of the Company, 
resulting in a loss of trust 
from parents, schools, and the 
public. Moreover, it may lead to 
legal issues, including lawsuits 
or fines for disseminating 
inappropriate or inaccurate 
information.
   Employ rigorous 
editorial standards and 
guidelines, ensuring 
accuracy, fairness, and 
ethical practices
   Conduct the content 
review process, 
including fact-checking 
and adherence to 
industry best practices.
   Facilitate open channels 
of communication to 
receive feedback and 
promptly address any 
concerns or complaints, 
including those of 
teachers

are perceived as dynamic and 
forward-thinking. Navneet’s 
B2C products, focussing on 
sustainability, can attract eco-
conscious customers, fostering 
a competitive advantage in both 
domestic and export markets.
15.
Safeguarding 
intellectual 
property
Intellectual property (IP) is a 
valuable asset for Navneet as it 
includes the original works and 
creative ideas that are the basis 
of the Company’s products. 
Safeguarding IP is essential 
to protecting the industry’s 
financial interests as well as 
maintaining the integrity and 
reputation of their brands.
   Review and update IP 
filings regularly 
   Ensure monitoring 
systems are in place 
to detect potential 
IP infringements or 
violations
16.
Compliance and 
business ethics

and strict compliance with 
laws and regulations yields 
numerous positive impacts for 
the Company. It fosters trust and 
credibility among stakeholders 
and by consistently adhering 
to ethical standards and legal 
requirements, the Company

damage and legal liabilities, 
safeguarding our long-term

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets 
and achievements
I am delighted to present our second Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR), reflecting on the recent 
advancements and initiatives at Navneet. At Navneet, We remain steadfast in our commitment to Environmental, 
Social, and Governance (ESG) principles, recognising their pivotal role in driving sustainable business growth and 
resilience.
Over the past year, we have implemented several strategic changes to enhance our ESG practices and performance. 
One notable development is the establishment of an ESG Board Committee and an ESG Working Committee, tasked 
with overseeing our sustainability efforts and ensuring alignment with our business objectives. These committees 
are guided by a newly adopted ESG Charter, which sets forth our commitment to integrating ESG considerations into 
every facet of our operations.

To further deepen our understanding of key ESG risks and opportunities, we have conducted a thorough materiality 
assessment in accordance with Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) requirements. This assessment has provided 
valuable insights into our stakeholders’ priorities and informed the development of targeted strategies to address 
them effectively.
In line with our commitment to responsible sourcing and procurement practices, we have adopted a Supplier Code 
of Conduct to uphold ethical standards throughout our supply chain. Additionally, we have expanded our emission 
calculations to include Scope 3 emissions and have initiated detailed carbon offset measures to mitigate our 
environmental impact.
I feel immensely proud to announce that we at Navneet are able to make a remarkable journey on the path of 
establishing and garnering the benefits of renewable energy. We could offset 55% of total emissions with investments 
in plantations and renewable energy sources like wind and solar. It proves that we have aligned ourselves with the 
country’s goal of replacing 50% of conventional energy sources with renewable energy by 2030, in the year 2023 itself. 
Nevertheless, we will continue the journey towards carbon neutrality with determination and in a technology-savvy 
manner.
Recognising the importance of dedicated leadership in driving ESG initiatives, we are pleased to announce the 
appointment of a dedicated Environmental, Health, Safety and Sustainability (EHSS) Head. This appointment 
underscores our commitment to embedding sustainability into our organisational DNA and underscores our resolve 
to pursue continuous improvement in our ESG performance.
Furthermore, we have conducted a comprehensive analysis of the training programmes conducted within our 
organisation, with a particular focus on human rights awareness and compliance. This analysis has enabled us to 
identify areas for improvement and refine our training initiatives to ensure alignment with our values and commitments.
As we reflect on our progress, we are proud of the strides we have made in advancing our sustainability agenda. 
However, we recognise that our journey is ongoing, and we remain dedicated to raising the bar for ESG excellence. 
Moving forward, we will continue to set ambitious targets, innovate sustainable solutions, and collaborate with our 
stakeholders to create shared value for all.

With regards to addressing issues, doubts, complaints, or grievances, employees and workers are encouraged to first 
reach out to their supervisor or manager for clarification or resolution. 
If the matter remains unresolved, employees can escalate it to the Head of Department (HOD), and if they are still not 
satisfied, they can approach the HR Department.
Navneet maintains an open-door policy, allowing employees and workers to freely communicate with the HR 
Department at any time regarding grievances.
Additionally, employees have the option to submit complaints or suggestions through a designated complaint/
suggestion box. The HR Department conducts weekly checks of the box, reviewing and recording the received 
complaints or suggestions.
Suitable action is taken on all suggestions/complaints, with any unresolved issues being handled by the Department 
Head or Head of HR.
It is important to note that employees who raise complaints are protected against any form of retaliation or adverse 
consequences.
Furthermore, this year, the Company conducted an employee feedback survey at its manufacturing sites. This survey, 
which was anonymous, received responses from over 70% of the employees.
The feedback collected was carefully analysed by the local management committee, leading to the development of an 
action plan to address any concerns raised by the employees.

10.	 Health and safety management system
	
a.	
Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Yes/No)
	
	
Yes
	
	
If yes, the coverage such systems?
	
	
Navneet has effectively rolled out the Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Management System across all its 
plants and offices. The Head Office and two major sites have achieved ISO 45001 certification, demonstrating 
their commitment to industry-leading safety standards.
	
b.	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis 
by the entity?
	
	
Our organisation is highly committed to ensuring and improving the workplace safety of its employees. Each 
site has the presence of a local EHS Manager, who tirelessly works towards improving workplace safety through 
various means.
	
	
Site-specific EHS trainings, Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment, Toolbox Talk, and the Permit to Work 
System, among others, are the preventive means to establishing an incident-free workplace. The Company follows 
all of these practices on a regular basis. Navneet prioritises accurate and timely reporting of incidents. Incident 
investigation, root cause analysis and corrective actions are defined by the core team, and timely, effective action 
is ensured.
	
	
The manufacturing sites have a Safety Committee, which meets every quarter to address employee-related health 
and safety issues. The Committee has worker representation as per the Maharashtra Factory Rules. 
	
	
A detailed PPE assessment was carried out to identify and address the work- or task-specific hazards. The PPEs 
had been procured and issued to the concerned employees. Plant supervisors and line managers have been made 
responsible for ensuring its proper usage.
	
	
Guards on the rotating parts of the machine, limit switches, relay switches, and sensors, among others, have 
been placed as an engineering control to prevent the direct access of employees to the machine where there is a 
probability of body parts encountering the rotating part.
	
	
Identification and correction of unsafe acts and unsafe conditions is a daily exercise. EHS Samvad is conducted 
on a monthly basis, where the EHS performance of the site is reviewed and an improvement plan is formed.
	
	
EHS training is an integral part of the overall training programme. Internal and external training programmes are 
conducted for every level of employee in the Company. Moreover, every business decision is inclusive of the EHS 
perspective.

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases.
	
Any individual who has experienced sexual harassment in the workplace may file a written complaint to the POSH 
Committee. This can be submitted either in hardcopy or via E-mail, detailing the incidents of harassment within three 
months from the date of the incident. In cases of repeated incidents, the complaint should be lodged within three

*As part of our persistent commitment to environmental sustainability, we have effectively offset approximately 5,929.8 
metric tonnes of CO2 equivalent (TCO2e) through strategic investments in wind and solar energy, along with biodiversity 
initiatives. Consequently, our net emissions have been reduced to 4,808.73 metric tonnes (MT) of CO2. Currently, our 
overall carbon offset rate stands at 55%. Specifically, our Scope 1 emissions have been mitigated by 16% primarily through 
plantation efforts, while our Scope 2 emissions have seen a substantial reduction of 70% due to our proactive investments 
in renewable energy sources. These initiatives underscore our dedication to advancing sustainable practices and reducing 
our carbon footprint.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? (Yes/No)
	
Yes
	
If yes, then provide details.
	
Navneet has implemented a number of initiatives aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, which include:
	
Renewable Energy Generation
	
The Company has installed 724 KW of solar panels at two of its manufacturing facilities, replacing traditional power 
consumption with renewable solar energy. This move has resulted in directly substituting 7% of non-renewable energy 
consumption for renewable sources of electricity. 
	
In addition, the Company also installed a wind power capacity of 4.8 MW, generating 68,68,689 units of power annually. 
By utilising wind and solar power, it is able to significantly reduce its reliance on fossil fuels and cut down on its 
greenhouse gas emissions.
	
Solar Heaters in Canteen Operations: Navneet is harnessing the power of the sun not only for its manufacturing needs 
but also for its everyday operations. Solar heaters are used to heat water and for cooking in the Company’s canteens, 
further emphasising its commitment to sustainable energy use. 
	
In total, approximately 70% of total electricity requirements are offset by renewable sources of energy, i.e., windmills 
and solar power plants. We have achieved the country’s carbon neutral target of producing energy from renewable 
sources by 50% in 2030 and in 2023 itself.
	
Carbon Emission Reduction
	
The Company’s effort to reduce its carbon footprint has been recognised by its prime customer in their Gigaton project, 
earning it the title of ‘Giga-guru’. So far, its initiatives have led to a significant reduction of CO2 emissions, with savings 
of 19,244.2 metric tonnes to date.
	
By incorporating renewable energy sources and reducing its greenhouse gas emissions, Navneet is actively contributing 
to the global fight against climate change. The Company remains committed to exploring and implementing more 
sustainable practices across its operations to further reduce its environmental impact.

10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by 
your Company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices 
adopted to manage such wastes.
	
Navneet is dedicated to minimising its environmental footprint through responsible waste management practices and 
a commitment to reducing the use of hazardous chemicals. Here are our key initiatives:
	
Responsible Hazardous Waste Disposal
	
All hazardous waste generated during our operations is disposed of by authorised vendors in strict compliance with 
regulations to ensure environmental and workforce safety.
	
Safety First: Solvent-Based Ink and PVC-Based Adhesives
	
We prioritise employee and environmental safety when handling solvent-based ink and PVC-based adhesives. This 
includes:
	
Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) Display and Training: MSDS information is readily available, and employees undergo 
training on safe handling procedures to mitigate the risks associated with these substances.

Wastewater Treatment: Ink-mixed wastewater undergoes treatment before discharge to safeguard water resources.
	
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE): Employees are equipped with appropriate PPE to prevent inhalation or skin 
contact with these materials, prioritising both employee and environmental safety.
	
Spill Prevention Measures: We implement protocols to prevent soil contamination from accidental spills.
	
Minimising Waste Generation
	
Reusable Water-Based Ink Carboys: To decrease plastic waste, water-based ink carboys are lined with polybags for 
reuse by the manufacturer, significantly reducing plastic consumption.
	
Wiro Product Packaging Return Programme: Customers are encouraged to return product packaging materials such as 
boxes, rings, and cores to manufacturers for reuse, thereby minimising waste and conserving resources.
	
PET Strap Reuse: Prioritise the reuse PET straps for palletisation of export and internal material movements instead of 
purchasing new ones. This promotes a circular economy, reduces waste generation, and leads to cost savings.
	
Optimising Resource Use
	
Improved Adhesive Carboy Design: Redesigned adhesive carboys with wider mouths and liners maximise adhesive 
usage and minimise waste. Transitioning from 50 kg carboys to smaller 5 kg ones eliminates approximately 1 kg of 
waste per carboy.
	
Reusable Antiskid Grip Sheets: Substituting single-use stretch wrap film with reusable antiskid grip sheets for internal 
mobility of finished goods and work-in-progress items reduces plastic waste and encourages sustainable packaging 
practices.
	
Higher-Micron Plastics: Moving away from lower-micron plastics (BOPP, PP bags, and shrink film) to higher-micron 
alternatives minimises environmental risks associated with plastic usage, demonstrating a commitment to reducing 
the environmental footprint.
	
Navneet Education Limited extends its commitment to responsible waste management beyond its facilities by 
registering under the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) programme for imported plastics and implementing a 
comprehensive Plastic Waste Management plan at its site.
	
These initiatives demonstrate Navneet’s commitment to minimising its environmental impact through responsible waste 
management practices and a proactive approach to reducing hazardous chemicals in our products and processes.
