MSWIL has established a comprehensive grievance redressal mechanism that encompasses various channels for receiving 
and addressing grievances. These mechanisms are designed to provide employees with multiple avenues to express their 
concerns and suggestions. Various working groups, such as employee consultative committees, health and safety committees, 
canteen committees, and welfare committees, have been established to address specific employee matters. These committees 
facilitate discussions and provide platforms for employee input. The human resources function within MSWIL plays a crucial 
role in impartially investigating and fact-finding with regard to any employee grievances, acting as an internal due diligence 
mechanism. Additionally, there are mechanisms in place to facilitate anonymous or private submissions through designated 
email addresses and/or telephone numbers. Furthermore, MSWIL has a dedicated Whistle-Blower Policy that serves as a formal 
platform for confidentially reporting and investigating grievances. This policy ensures that employees have a secure channel 
to raise concerns without fear of reprisal.
Lastly, MSWIL has a comprehensive policy on the prevention, prohibition, and redressal of sexual harassment in the workplace. 
In compliance with the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition, and Redressal) Act, 2013, many 
of Motherson’s Indian units have Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs) responsible for conducting inquiries related to such 
complaints. These committees play a crucial role in ensuring a safe and inclusive work environment.
Overall,  grievance redressal mechanisms provide employees with various avenues to raise concerns, seek resolution, and 
contribute to a positive and respectful work culture.

Provide details of any corrective action taken or underway to address safety-related incidents (if any) and on significant risks / 
concerns arising from assessments of health & safety practices and working conditions.
We have implemented various corrective measures to address safety-related incidents and mitigate risks in our workplace. One 
significant action we have taken is the installation of safety covers and safety sensors on all machines, ensuring that potential 
risks associated with machine operations are eliminated or minimized.
Additionally, we have modified the safety covers of our C&C machines to further enhance their protective capabilities and 
reduce any potential risks they may pose. By enhancing the design and functionality of these covers, we have taken proactive 
steps to prevent accidents and maintain a safe working environment.
To ensure the safety of our employees during maintenance or repair work, we have implemented the LOTO (Lockout-Tagout) 
system. This system allows us to de-energize all machines and electrical panels before any maintenance or repair activities 
take place. By following this procedure, we significantly reduce the risk of electrical accidents and provide a safe working 
environment for our staﬀ.
To address the potential threat of fire, we conduct thermal imaging of 100% of our machines and electrical panels. This proactive 
measure helps us identify any abnormal heat signatures that may indicate potential fire hazards. By promptly detecting and 
addressing such issues, we can eﬀectively control and mitigate the risk of fires in our workplace.
In order to maintain a culture of safety awareness, we regularly organize safety promotional activities. These initiatives aim 
to educate and raise awareness among our employees about various safety practices, procedures, and potential risks. By 
actively promoting safety consciousness, we create a work environment where employees are vigilant and actively contribute 
to maintaining a safe workplace.
Furthermore, we have implemented the use of RCCB (Residual Current Circuit Breaker) 30 mA devices in our electrical 
installations. RCCBs are safety devices specifically designed to protect against electrical shocks by quickly detecting any 
imbalance in the electrical circuit and interrupting the power supply. By incorporating RCCBs with a high Earth impedance, we 
prioritize human safety and minimize the risk of electrical accidents.
These comprehensive actions and measures demonstrate our commitment to maintaining and enhancing health and safety 
practices in our workplace. We continually assess our working conditions and practices to identify any potential risks or 
concerns, taking appropriate steps to address them promptly and eﬀectively.

Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues.
Clause 3.1 of the Human Rights Principles Statement, available at https://www.mswil.motherson.com/storage/policies/Human-Rights-Policy.pdf, 
states the following: “Motherson acknowledges the importance of international principles referenced in Section 1.3 of these 
Principles. It recognizes the need to conduct a human rights due diligence process and will evaluate its eﬀectiveness through 
this process. This entails internally analyzing the implications within the business units and integrating the topic into the 
existing risk assessment system. The purpose is to fulfill Motherson’s duty of diligence in relation to human rights. The human 
rights due diligence process involves assessing both actual and potential human rights impacts by consulting with potentially 
aﬀected groups and relevant stakeholders. The findings from impact assessments will be incorporated and acted upon across 
relevant internal functions. Responses will be monitored using appropriate qualitative and quantitative indicators, and external 
communication will address how the impacts are being addressed. The process aims to identify, prevent, mitigate, and account 
for how Motherson handles human rights issues, establishing a solid and sustainable approach.

Water withdrawal, consumption and discharge in areas of water stress (in kilolitres):
Wiring Harness facility does not uses water in our production processes. MSWIL units are applying Rain Water Harvesting 
solutions that also percolate rainwater into groundwater to maintain groundwater levels. To reduce the dependency on ground 
water, we have started to collect the rainwater by creating the dedicated pond. By the use of smart automation, we have 
achieved to add this in on our reservoir results reducing the dependency on ground water.

Below are the initiatives:
Transitioning to Cleaner Fuels- In our endeavour to reduce pollution and optimize operational costs, we have replaced diesel as 
a fuel source in generators with cleaner alternatives such as Piped Natural Gas (PNG). This transition not only helps us save on 
diesel costs but also significantly reduces our carbon emissions, contributing to a healthier environment.
We are  procuring new  Diesel gensets based on latest CPCB IV norms . This will help in reducing the carbon emissions and to 
achieve in carbon net zero goals
To diversify our energy procurement and reduce our carbon footprint, we have initiated power purchase agreements with 
private sources, including wind power providers in addition to installing roof solar plants.
In our ongoing quest for innovative renewable energy solutions, we are striving to use cutting-edge technologies such as 
windmills and solar power. These installations harness the power of nature to supplement our energy needs, resulting in 
reduced reliance on conventional energy sources.
5.
Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan? Give details in 100 words/ web link.
Yes, we do have business continuity and disaster management policy in place. Presence in multiple locations and standardized 
processes is essential for de-risking operations. By diversifying risk across several sites, we ensure that even a single catastrophic 
event, such as a natural disaster or political upheaval, does not incapacitate the entire operation. Furthermore, implementing 
a standardized shop floor layout across all locations ensures uniformity in processes, which simplifies training, enhances 
eﬀiciency, and maintains consistent quality. Standardized procedures also facilitate quicker recovery and continuity during a 
disaster, as personnel can seamlessly transition between sites without a learning curve.
