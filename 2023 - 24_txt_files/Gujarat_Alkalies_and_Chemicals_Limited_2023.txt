The Company 
may encounter

environmental risks 
due to climate

water scarcity and 
extreme weather 
events. 
GACL has opted for climate resilient

perspectives. It 
increases the

in a negative

can also impact 
the company's

management.
GACL has controls & procedures in place to 
monitor and control the energy consumption. 
The Company continuously monitors the 
energy consumption across its operations.

Higher carbon

substantially 
contribute to 
air pollution 
and adverse 
environmental 
impact. This has 
UKIPKſECPV TKUMU
to the Company 
from regulatory 
and reputational 
perspective. 
GACL has initiated the transition to 
renewable energy sources to reduce carbon 
footprints and emissions. GACL has been 
capturing CO2 HTQO ƀWG ICU VQ RTQFWEG C
value-added product, namely Potassium

The Company has installed various 
Windmills having total Wind Power

FY 2024-25 GACL has successfully tied up 
with NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Limited 
(NVVNL) and Tata Power Trading Company 
Limited (TPTCL) for supply of solar power 
to the Company from their 50 MW and 70 
MW solar power installations respectively. 
This will result into reduction of the cost 
of electric power by increasing renewable 
power content to about 40% on annual basis. 
The Company is in process of targeting to 
achieve 80% of green power out of its total 
requirements in next 2-3 years.

Water 
consumption 
and waste 
generation
R
Water consumption 
in an excessive 
quantity is a 
potential risk 
for a chemical 
company. This 
will impact water 
availability leading 
to water scarcity, 
and dependency 
on local water 
supplies. Further, 
this will be resulting 
in environmental 
concerns, 
reputational damage 
and cost escalation 
in the company’s 
reputation.
Waste generation 
poses risk 
to regulatory 
compliances and 
increases operating 
costs.
GACL has adopted responsible usage 
of water by tracking water withdrawal, 
consumption and discharge. Also, a part 
of the water is recycled and reused. The 
Company has also planned to purify the 
sewage water of Vadodara Municipal 
Corporation and use it in the plant. A

in one of the water reservoirs to reduce 
evaporation losses.
The Company has also participated in 
desalination project of 100 MLD water set 
up by GIDC at Dahej. GACL share in this 
project is 10 MLD water. This amounts to 
about 75 – 80% of water requirement at 
Dahej complex met through desalinated 
water, thereby reducing use of surface water.

Compliance 
Management
R
Any non-compliance 
to the statutory 
requirements by 
the Company 
may result into 
disruptions in 
operations, 
penalties, and loss 
of reputation.
GACL has established a system to track 
and address all the statutory compliances. 
The Company has adopted Compliance 
Management System and places report on 
compliances before the Board quarterly.
