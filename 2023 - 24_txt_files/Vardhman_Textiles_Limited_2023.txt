Yes, our organization has implemented an occupational health and safety management system, as evidenced by 
our ISO 14001:2015 certification. The coverage of this system includes various measures aimed at achieving a zero-
accident workplace.
	
	
To ensure the health and safety of our employees, we have organized various health check-up camps at all our units 
regularly over the past year. Additionally, we have established occupational health centers staffed by qualified 
healthcare professionals.
	
	
Furthermore, our commitment to safety is demonstrated through regular fire mock drills conducted by the security 
department on a weekly basis, as well as mock drills and emergency evacuation drills conducted every six months.

associated with each activity, determining their aspects and impacts and prioritizing risks accordingly. By concentrating on 
activities with heightened risk levels, we enact measures to effectively mitigate these risks.
	
	
Furthermore, we actively encourage worker involvement in hazard identification through near miss reporting, recognizing 
it as a valuable tool for pinpointing hazards in work areas. The input and insights provided by our workers are highly valued 
in this process.
	
	
Additionally, we employ various methods such as audits, surveys and cross-functional team meetings to analyze problems 
and enhance our understanding of hazards and risks across the organization. Discussions held during Management 
Review meetings further contribute to this understanding.
	
	
Moreover, our commitment to safety is reinforced through monthly incident and accident analysis, which enable us to 
identify major contributing factors. Based on these findings, we offer targeted training on workplace safety procedures to 
effectively address identified risks.
	
	
Through these integrated processes, we proactively identify and address work-related hazards, implement appropriate 
control measures and continuously strive to minimize risks to our workforce, fostering a safer working environment for all.
	
c.	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such 
risks. (Y/N):
	
	
Yes, the Company has a process in place for workers to report work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such 
risks. This includes the implementation of Unsafe Activity & Unsafe Condition reporting registers in all units, providing a 
platform for workers to report any unsafe acts or conditions observed in the workplace. This system encourages active 
employee participation in hazard identification and promotes a culture of safety. We review sources such as OSHA standards, 
management views, corporate guidance, industry consensus standards and engineering reports to identify potential hazards 
and control measures. We actively seek input from workers who may suggest and evaluate solutions based on their 
knowledge of the facility, equipment and work processes. Furthermore, we have additional mechanisms such as near-miss 
reporting systems and suggestion schemes to further identify problems and solutions within the workplace.
	
	
By incorporating these processes and fostering collaboration between workers and management, we ensure the well-
being of our workforce and strive to minimize accidents or incidents effectively.

12.	 Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy workplace.
	
The Company implements proactive measures to ensure a safe and healthy workplace environment. Regular hazard 
assessments, including the Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA) process, are conducted to identify and eliminate 
potential risks effectively. By addressing these hazards at their source, the Company significantly reduces the likelihood of 
accidents or injuries. The Company ensures that all employees undergo comprehensive training in occupational health and 
safety practices. This includes instruction on the safe operation of machinery and equipment, proper handling of hazardous 
substances and adherence to safety protocols. Moreover, the Company places a high priority on providing appropriate personal 
protective equipment (PPE) to its employees. Comprehensive training is provided to ensure that employees have access to and 
are proficient in the correct use of safety gear such as helmets, gloves, safety shoes, goggles and ear protection.
	
Furthermore, the Company actively promotes visual safety aids and messages throughout its facilities. Utilizing a variety of 
mediums including signs, labels, posters and other visual aids, important safety information and reminders are effectively 
communicated to employees. These visual aids serve as constant reminders of safe practices and play a pivotal role in 
reinforcing a robust safety culture within the organization.

risks / concerns arising from assessments of health & safety practices and working conditions.
	
In each of our manufacturing operations, we maintain dedicated safety committees that convene regularly to address safety 
concerns and develop strategies for fostering a safe work environment. These committees play a vital role in ensuring that 
safety protocols are upheld and continuously improved upon.
	
Furthermore, we conduct periodic mock drills across all manufacturing operations to simulate emergency scenarios and evaluate 
the effectiveness of our emergency response procedures. These drills help to ensure that our workforce is well-prepared to 
handle any potential emergencies that may arise.
	
In our production halls, we replace all the normal wooden and glass doors with fire-rated door. This proactive measure not only 
reduces the risk of injury due to broken glass but also enhances fire safety measures within the facility.
	
Additionally, to ensure the safety of workers around critical machinery, proper guarding with door interlocking has been 
provided. This means that access to these machines is restricted and the doors automatically interlock when the machines are 
in operation, preventing unauthorized entry and minimizing the risk of accidents.
	
These initiatives reflect our commitment to prioritize the safety and well-being of our workforce by implementing robust safety 
measures to mitigate potential hazards effectively.

The Company is committed to environmental sustainability, exemplified by our concerted efforts to minimize water consumption and 
adopt eco-friendly practices across our operations. At all our facilities, we adhere strictly to the Pollution Control Board (PCB) norms.
	
Our two sites are equipped with advanced ZLD systems—Budhni, our largest integrated facility, boasts a ZLD System with 
an effluent treatment capacity of 11,000 KLD. Utilizing a bio-oxidation process, this plant achieves remarkable COD and BOD 
removal efficiencies of 90-92% and 96-98% respectively, without chemical treatment. Approximately 8,400 KLD of biologically 
treated effluent is recycled through reverse osmosis (RO) and mechanical vapor compression (MEE) for process reuse, while 
the remaining treated water contributes to Green Belt Development. Achieving a recovery rate of 99.0% through RO and MEE, 
the salt recovered by MEE is disposed of at government authorized facilities.
	
Similarly, our Baddi location operates a ZLD system with an effluent capacity of 2000 KLD, employing a bio-oxidation process 
followed by recycling through RO-MEE for process reuse, further exemplifying our commitment to sustainable water 
management practices across our operations.

10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by 
your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices 
adopted to manage such wastes.
	
The Company is actively involved in better waste management practices, we prioritize waste reduction, maximize recycling 
and reuse opportunities and ensure responsible disposal of waste. Here are a few points that highlight the positive aspects of 
Vardhman's waste management practices:
	
Textiles Waste Recycling: We actively explore opportunities to reuse materials within our operations. One exemplary initiative 
is the Vardhman Recycling Plant, Renova, located in Baddi, Himachal Pradesh. This facility converts textile waste into new fibers, 
which are then used to create new clothes or other textile products. By diverting textiles from landfills to recycling, the plant 
significantly reduces the environmental impact of textile waste.
	
Follow 3R’s of waste management: We prioritize waste reduction by identifying operational areas where waste can be 
minimized through process optimization and adoption of alternative practices. Our commitment extends to recycling various 
waste types, such as plastic, wood, cardboard and plastic cones, by entrusting them to authorized vendors.

Annual Report 2023-24
	
For waste that cannot be reduced, recycled or reused, we ensure it is disposed of properly. Hazardous waste like chemical 
containers and empty barrels including waste oil through authorized recyclers other hazardous waste like ETP Sludge, MEE Salt 
and biomedical waste are handed over to Treatment, Storage and Disposal Facilities (TSDFs) authorized by the State Pollution 
Control Board. Similarly, non-hazardous waste and e-waste are given to vendors authorized by the State Pollution Control Board. 
This ensures that the disposal of such waste follows all necessary regulations and guidelines.
	
100% Recycling of Plastic Packaging: Implementation of the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) Plan, specifically for the 
collection and recycling of 100% of plastic packaging waste.
	
Using STP-generated sludge for horticulture: Sludge, which is a byproduct of sewage treatment, is typically rich in organic 
matter and nutrients. Instead of considering it as waste we utilize it for horticulture as valuable organic manure.
	
By adopting these waste management practices, Vardhman is contributing to a circular economy where materials are reused, 
recycled and repurposed. This aligns with the principles of sustainability, promoting responsible resource management and 
reducing the overall environmental footprint.
