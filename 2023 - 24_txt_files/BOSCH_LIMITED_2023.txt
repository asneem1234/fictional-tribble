emission 
across

particularly 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
Bosch 
Group’s 
carbon 
neutrality 
and Scope 3 target
Opportunity
Bosch is already Scope 1and 
2 neutral from 2020*. 
With its more than 400 
locations 
worldwide, 
the 
Bosch 
Group 
has 
been 
carbon 
neutral 
overall 
(scopes 
1 
& 
2 
of 
the 
Greenhouse Gas Protocol 
Corporate Accounting and 
Reporting Standard) since 
2020. This is achieved with 
four levers: improving energy 
efficiency, generating energy 
from 
renewable 
sources, 
purchasing green electricity, 
and offsetting residual CO₂ 
emissions 
with 
carbon 
credits. Visit https://www.
bosch.com/sustainability/ 
for further information on the 
Bosch Group’s sustainability 
strategy. We have a clear 
plan for lowering absolute 
Scope 3 CO2 emission by 
15% by 2030 (baseline year 
2018)

Opportunity
Some Bosch Limited sites 
in India fall under severe/ 
severest water scarcity sites 
as per the Water Risk Filter 
provided by Worldwide Fund 
for Nature (WWF)
We are on track to reach our 
target of reducing absolute 
water withdrawal in regions 
of scarcity by 25% by 2025

3.
Closing 
products 
and material loops 
using 
secondary 
materials and raw 
materials
Opportunity
Bosch has a broad and highly 
diverse product portfolio. 
Our products ensure safe 
and sustainable mobility. As 
varied as our products are in 
detail, they share a common 
ethos: “Invented for life.” 
We want to spark people’s 
enthusiasm, to improve their 
quality of life, and to help 
protect the environment
With our circular economy 
strategy, 
we 
want 
to 
enhance the sustainability 
of our products throughout 
their entire life cycle – 
from 
procurement 
and 
production to use, return, 
and remanufacturing, and 
right through to recycling 
and 
reuse 
of 
materials.

to 
either 
create

way, we reduce the amount 
of materials used and our

contribute 
toward 
achieving

target.  At the same time, 
we also avoid potential risks 
relating to compliance with 
environmental 
and 
social 
standards. Building a closed- 
loop system for materials 
has the particular advantage 
of eliminating parts of the 
value chain that are subject 
to risks.

standards 
in supply chains, 
particularly 
for 
high-risk 
raw 
materials
Opportunity
Detailed analysis of raw 
materials identified 15 high 
risk materials that Bosch 
uses. To address the risks 
Bosch launched specific risk-
mitigating programs.
We 
apply 
risk-based 
approach in our regular 
assessment of our supplier’s 
sustainability performance.
There are four methods that 
we use depending on the 
prevailing conditions and the 
specific risk situation. Self-
declaration by suppliers and 
third-party audits are used to 
complement the quick scans 
and drill deep assessments 
that Bosch performs itself

With regard to substances 
of concern, Bosch built a 
central IT system – MaCS

Implications of the 
mobility
transformation
Opportunity
Bosch Limited has been 
at the forefront of mobility 
transformation 
in 
India 
across several decades.
Most recently we supported 
our 
OEM 
customers 
to 
migrate from BSIV to BSVI. 
We are also watching the 
changes 
across 
vehicle 
categories 
towards 
electrification and hydrogen 
and are well poised to 
leverage this transit
As systems supplier for highly 
efficient drive systems, it 
plays a key role in advancing 
the development of electric 
drives with products such 
as the eAxle or improved 
thermal 
management 
for 
hybrid systems and electric 
power trains. At the same 
time, Bosch is investing in 
fuel 
cell 
technology 
and 
continuously 
developing 
digitalization 
solutions 
to 
enable 
further 
efficiency 
gains. Our business success 
in these fields will also 
increase 
the 
contribution 
we 
make 
to 
conserving 
resources and climate action 
– while we move a step closer 
to our ambitious CO₂ targets. 
Last but not least, through 
innovative vehicle technology 
Bosch 
can 
help 
vehicle 
manufacturers to contribute 
to improving air quality.
Bosch’s latest diesel and 
gasoline technology makes 
it possible to significantly 
lower 
nitrogen 
oxide 
emissions and particulate 
emissions. The aim is to 
design internal combustion 
engines with emissions that 
no longer impact our cities’ 
air quality in any notable way.

Governance, leadership and oversight
7.
Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, 
targets and achievements At Bosch we are convinced that sustainability must be a non-negotiable part of doing 
business. Back in 2018, we summarized the focus areas of our sustainability management in a vision that describes 
six dimensions. Each of these is specified and continually enhanced by reference to two focus activities with clearly

All business activities of the Bosch-Group and the acts of its employees must be in compliance with laws, the Code of 
Business Conduct and with further internal corporate guidelines and central directives. We adhere to the principle of 
legality in all dealings, actions, contracts, and other activities in all countries in which we operate.
 
As per Bosch Code of Business Conduct, Bosch does not tolerate corruption in any form. Corrupt behavior of associates 
or business partners is liable to prosecution as it distorts competition, results in financial loss, and harms the company’s 
reputation. The Code of Business Conduct can be accessed at https://assets.bosch.com/media/en/global/sustainability/ 
strategy/vision_and_goals/bosch-code-of-business-conduct.pdf
 
The central directive “Gratuities in dealings with third parties” regulates how to deal with gratuities in the course of 
Bosch’s business activities. It defines minimum core requirements for giving and receiving gratuities. When it comes to 
giving gratuities to public officials or people in similar positions, we apply extreme restrictions. We wish to avoid even the 
appearance of an attempt to gain influence. We ourselves do not accept gratuities from public officials. We neither offer 
nor grant public officials benefits for carrying out or expediting official acts. We abide by this regardless of whether we are 
legally entitled to the official act, or the public official behaves in a manner that violates their official duties.

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24     
 
The Bosch Group has a Code of Conduct for Business Partners that defines a clear commitment to legality, Bosch 
values, social and environmental standards. Its business partners are regularly subject to a standardized and risk- based 
compliance check. The Code of Conduct for Business Partners can be accessed at https://assets.bosch.com/ media/en/
global/sustainability/strategy/values_and_responsibility/code-of-conduct-for-business-partners.pdf
 
The aspect of ‘whistleblower protection’ is comprehensively dealt within the Bosch globally binding Directive “Bosch 
Group Compliance Management System”, the Whistle Blower Policy and the Code of Business Conduct of Bosch Limited. 
These binding regulations clearly mandate that all employees should report possible violations of the law, internal 
regulations or breaches of the Code of Business Conduct in Confidence and the reports made in good faith must not result 
in any disadvantage for the reporting employee. Every report of possible violations as well as the measures subsequently 
taken are documented by the Compliance Officer.
 
The compliance training program is available to our associates as Web-based training (WBT) and offered as classroom 
training or webinars. Participation is mandatory for certain groups of associates selected using a risk-based approach, 
including associates without collectively bargained contracts due to their special responsibility as specialists or managers, 
but also numerous associates in selected areas or in special functions. Our minimum compliance training courses cover 
five areas: business ethics, product compliance, anti-corruption, antitrust, and export control. Our training courses are 
regularly refined and updated to accommodate new content and developments.

Description of the risk / concern
Action Taken
All products
Based on the idea of a closed-loop or circular 
economy, we have been systematically conducting 
life cycle assessments (LCAs) for major product 
groups since 2017. This entails an evaluation 
of 
product-specific 
environmental 
aspects 
in 
each phase of the life cycle – from purchasing to 
production and use right through to disposal.
Among the evaluated aspects are, for example, the 
use of materials, the consumption of energy and 
resources in the manufacturing and use phase, 
recycling and the use of recycled materials, and 
remanufacturing at the end of the product’s life 
cycle.
Depending on the use case, we distinguish 
between two assessment methods: the full-
scale LCA, performed in compliance with 
ISO 14040 and 14044, and the streamlined 
LCA, allowing faster assessment of specific 
issues and drawing on standard database 
values.
e-Bikes (as an 
example)
In using the LCAs, our attention still focuses on the 
product’s carbon footprint.
We want to find out which phase of the product life 
cycle and which materials create the biggest carbon 
footprint so that we can take dedicated action to
In an effort to continuously identify further 
potential to save carbon emissions when 
developing new products, Bosch e-Bike 
Systems 
started 
using 
a 
proprietary 
LCA processing tool. This permits an

reduce it in the product development process or in 
further development of series products.
A look at the carbon footprint of each phase of the 
product life cycle reveals where the biggest savings 
potential lies. Around 75 percent of CO₂ emissions 
are attributable to materials and production, about 
15 percent to the product’s use phase, and the 
remaining roughly 10 percent arise from transport, 
packaging, and recycling.
Overall, a pedelec has a carbon footprint of 300 
kg CO₂ on average, of which the e-Bike system, 
consisting of motor, battery, and display, accounts 
for around 120 kg CO₂. Considering the e-Bike 
components separately from the rest of the bike, 
some 60 percent of emissions are attributable to the 
battery. Building on this LCA, Bosch e-Bike Systems 
identified various possibilities for reducing CO₂ 
emissions within the product life cycle of the motor 
and the battery.
even faster, more detailed, and flexible 
comparison of the carbon emissions of 
various product components, thereby 
supporting efficient decision-making in the 
product development process.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details
 
With its more than 400 locations worldwide, the Bosch Group has been carbon neutral overall since 2020 (scope 1 & 
2). Our climate action strategy comprises four levers: increasing energy efficiency, generating energy ourselves from 
renewable sources (new clean power), purchasing electricity from renewable sources (green electricity), and – as the last 
resort – using carbon credits to offset remaining CO₂ emissions. In 2023 also, we continued to improve the mix of levers 
by increasing energy efficiency, generating our own energy from renewable sources, and purchasing green electricity. 
This is reflected in the further reduction of CO₂ emissions to be offset. The progress made with each lever in 2023 is 
described below:
 
Lever 1: Increasing energy efficiency
 
By 2030, across Bosch group, we want to substantially increase our energy efficiency and operationalize measures at our 
company locations with savings potential totaling 1.7 terawatt-hours (TWh). An annual budget has been available for this 
purpose since 2019. Overall, Bosch plans to invest one billion euros in increasing energy efficiency by 2030.
 
Since 2019, Bosch group has initiated around 6,000 projects worldwide, with more than 1,300 new projects added in 
2023 alone. In total, we have thus far captured savings potential of 984 GWh through these measures. This corresponds 
to 58 percent goal achievement.
 
At Bosch Limited, by increasing energy efficiency through innovative technologies, the Company aims to reduce energy 
consumption and, in turn, GHG emissions. The emphasis is on finding innovative ways to save energy, such as upgrading 
air compressors, chillers, air handlers, and filtration systems using new technologies. Across Bosch Limited, its 8 locations 
will benefit from improved energy efficiency projects. 
 
Lever 2: Expanding new clean power
 
By 2030, we want to generate 400 GWh of the annual energy demand in-house at our company locations from renewable 
sources. We are placing particular emphasis here on photovoltaics (PV). A total of 114 Bosch sites were already using 
solar power for their energy supply at the end of 2023. In total, we generated around 149 GWh of renewable energy across 
Bosch Group during the year 2023, which means that as of yearend we have already achieved 37 percent of the target.
 
Across Bosch Limited, during financial year 2023-24, the total installed capacity of in house photovoltaic plants stood at 
24 MW. It generated 33 GWh of renewable energy which fulfilled 18% of total energy requirement. 
 
Lever 3: Purchasing green electricity
 
Bosch Group has concentrated on purchasing green electricity from existing plants and has been greatly expanding its 
purchase volume from green electricity with corresponding guarantees of origin since 2019. In total, around 99 percent 
of the Bosch Group’s global electricity demand was already covered using green electricity in 2023. We have therefore 
already reached our interim target for 2025 and are set to exclusively source green electricity by 2030. 
 
At Bosch Limited, the combined volume of purchased green electricity from existing plants and corresponding guarantees 
of origin amounted to 127 GWh fulfilling 69% of total energy requirement.
 
Lever 4: Carbon offsets
 
At present, across Bosch Group, carbon credits offset residual CO₂ emissions, such as from combustion processes 
(heating, process heat). In addition, we refer to carbon credits to offset electricity sourced in countries with only limited 
availability of green electricity. As we make progress with levers 1 to 3, we want to gradually reduce the share that we 
offset to achieve carbon neutrality (scope 1 & 2) to no more than 15 percent by 2030 (baseline year 2018).
 
In 2023, we came another step closer to achieving this target — especially as a result of progressively switching from gray 
to green electricity (gray electricity: electricity from fossil fuels). In 2023, we cut the volume of emissions to be offset to 
some 5,81,000 metric tons of CO₂. This is around 1,36,000 metric tons of CO₂ or 19 percent less than in the previous year.
 
When selecting carbon offset projects, we use as guidance internationally recognized and independent certifications 
such as the Gold Standard. In the future we want to focus our carbon offset measures even more intensively on nature-
based removals. The relevant projects involve sequestering CO₂ in biomass, for example by afforestation.
 
At Bosch Limited, 7480.04 metric tons of CO2 was compensated with Carbon credits which amounts to 13% of total 
energy requirement.

act in strict adherence to our confidentiality obligations and relevant statutory mandates in this regard.
 
Our Data Protection Notice (https://www.bosch.in/data-protection-notice/) explains our approach to data processing.
 
We have appointed a Data Protection Officer to guide the company in matters of Data Protection as well as to administer 
measures pertinent to Data Security .
 
We have a mechanism in place to handle privacy related requests and grievances as well as an established framework to 
handle security risks, related escalations and contingencies.

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24     
 
We conduct regular internal and external audits and assessments of our processes and projects. Our various entities are 
ISO-27001 as well as TISAX certified.
 
Our focus is to resolve complex data protection concerns with simple and effective solutions. Ensuring harmony between 
business interests and privacy is paramount to us.
 
Cybersecurity has been an integral part of the development of new Bosch products, based on a comprehensive technology 
portfolio. Due to advancing connectivity and the increasing significance of software, protection from cyberattacks is 
becoming important. Connections to the internet and to smartphones must be protected from unauthorized access as 
well. For over ten years, Bosch has in place, well-structured processes for developing cybersecurity-critical products and 
these are applicable to enterprise IT systems as well, in the Bosch group of companies globally.
 
Cybersecurity is a key component of Bosch’s promise of quality and an important aspect of the development, production, 
and operation of our products. At Bosch, risk based approach framework is in place to address the cybersecurity posture 
throughout the lifecycle. The first step is determining all potential threats and risks for the product. Conducting a threat 
analysis and risks assessment (TARA), these risks can be evaluated in order to, in the next step, select suitable protective 
measures during development and create the security concept which is state-of-the-art. Before approval, a penetration 
test, meaning a simulated cyber-attack, has to be performed for all products interfacing internet or untrusted protocols 
(WiFi, zigbee,..) - to test the effectiveness of the measures. To implement cybersecurity in product lifecycle, competent 
associates are developed through comprehensive cybersecurity university program. Also Web based trainings, sessions 
and roadshows with marketplace are conducted to increase the awareness amongst employees.
 
Bosch also offers support to its customers during operation to ensure that cybersecurity is in place until the end of 
product life. As part of a maintenance agreement, Bosch supports its customers in continuously analyzing the threat 
situation over the lifetime- to identify new vulnerabilities and to be able to respond quickly. By using intrusion detection 
systems (IDS), attacks on vehicles can be automatically detected, reported to a central vehicle security operations center, 
and analyzed there.
 
A lot of the expertise of our cybersecurity experts from these years of experience has gone into the standardization 
activities for the new ISO/SAE 21434 standard for automotive sector, which is being applied in product engineering.
 
At Bosch, Bosch Cyber Defense Center (BCDC) is in place operating 24/7/365 mode. Detection controls are continuously 
looking for risks in the IT-infrastructure. The risks are assigned to the known assets and identities in the environment. 
Once a specific threshold is exceeded, an alert is triggered. BCDC does security monitoring and detection and response 
to IT-Security related threats for the Enterprise IT (servers, endpoints, directories, network devices, IT- Security protection 
system), Manufacturing IT, Private and Public Clouds. The mission of BCDC is to secure assets and identities by detecting 
and responding to threat actors such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APT), Organized Crime, Insider Crime, Hacktivists 
and Script Kiddies. BCDC also reports incidents to CERT-IN (Computer Emergency Response Team – India) as per local 
regulations.

qualitative information (09 attributes as per Annexure I - Format of BRSR Core) disclosed by Bosch. Reporting Organization is 
responsible for archiving the related data for a reasonable time period. This assurance engagement is based on the

ortunities for Im rovement 
The following are the opportunities for improvement reported to Bosch. However, they are generally consistent with Bosch 
management's objectives and programs. Bosch already identified below topics and Assurance team endorse the same to 
achieve the Sustainable Goals of organization. 
i. 
Bosch can develop the equivalence document between the GRI and the BRSR core requirements and undertake 
the trainings on the plant level, 
ii. 
Bosch may conduct the formal internal audits of the data disclosed under BRSR, 
iii. Bosch may encourage their suppliers especially for inbound and out bound logistics for green mobility. 
Conflict of Interest 
In the context of BRSR requirements set by SEBI, addressing conflict of interest is crucial to maintain high integrity and 
independence of assurance engagements. As per SEBI guidelines, assurance providers need to disclose any potential 
conflict of interest that could compromise the independence or neutrality of their assessments. TUVI diligently identifies 
any relationships, affiliations, or financial interests that could potentially cause conflict of interest. We proactively 
implement measures to mitigate or manage these conflicts, ensuring independence and impartiality in our assurance 
engagements. We provide clear and transparent disclosures about any identified conflicts of interest in our assurance 
statement. We recognize that failure to address conflict of interest adequately could undermine the creditability of the 
assurance process and the reliability of the reported information. Therefore, we strictly adhere to SEBI guidelines and take 
necessary measures to avoid, disclose, or mitigate conflicts of interest effectively. 
Our Conclusion 
In our opinion, based on the scope of this assurance engagement, the disclosures on BRSR Core KPI described in the BRSR 
report along with the referenced information provides a fair representation of the 9 attributes, and meets the general 
content and quality requirements of the BRSR. TUVI confirms its competency to conduct the assurance engagement for 
the BRSR as per SEBI guidelines. Our team possesses expertise in ESG verification, assurance methodologies, and 
regulatory frameworks. We ensure independence, employ robust methodologies, and maintain continuous improvement to 
deliver reliable assessments.
