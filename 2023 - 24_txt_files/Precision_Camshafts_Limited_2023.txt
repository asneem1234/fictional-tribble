components of our people philosophy. We have institutionalised diversity and inclusion into our employment processes-
meritocracy, fairness and ethics being the pillars of our people management strategy. We believe that workplace diversity 
is a vital component in building an enabling and empowering workplace Keeping this in mind, we do not discriminate our

religion, colour, sexual orientation, disability, age or marital status. In our agenda to foster an inspiring workplace, we 
provide equal opportunities to all team members. We continually put in place several initiatives to further strengthen our

potential savings and explore new technologies to achieve our goals.
 
 Our sustainability vision and our continual efforts have helped us reduce a considerable number of emissions. To manage our 
carbon impact and achieve our emission reduction goals, we have strategised a variety of measures including interventions 
such as replacing fossil fuel with Renewable Solar energy. We will have a 7% reduction in scope 1 & 2 by 2030 from our 
reporting year calculations. We are planning for renewable energy at our sites in the coming years.
