The 
increasing 
awareness 
of climate 
change across 
the globe will 
reduce the 
demand for 
such vessels 
and affect the 
operations of 
CSL.
CSL is building 23 Hybrid Electric Catamaran Hull 
Vessels for the Kochi Water Metro Project, which is 
one of its kind, modern, technologically advanced, 
energy efficient and environment friendly vessel. 
Further CSL is also building 2 Commissioning Service 
Operation Vessels, 2 Zero Emission Feeder Container 
Vessels and 2 Hybrid Service Operation Vessels for 
various European clients.

Increase in

Aligned with the global shift toward maritime green 
transitions, the company has developed and built 
India’s first indigenous hydrogen-fuelled electric 
vessel, a pioneering project funded by the Ministry of 
Ports, Shipping, and Waterways (MoPSW). This pilot 
project, based on Low Temperature Proton Exchange 
Membrane (LT-PEM) technology - also known as Fuel 
Cell Electric Vessel (FCEV) was spearheaded by CSL’s 
C-SAS division in collaboration with KPIT Technologies 
Limited, which handled the technological aspects 
of the design, development, and construction. This 
initiative is part of India’s broader efforts to embrace 
innovative, sustainable, and cost-effective alternative 
fuel technologies. The project was executed in 
collaboration with Indian partners.
The Ministry of Ports, Shipping, and Waterways 
has already initiated several measures toward this 
objective, with CSL leading the charge in Green 
Shipping initiatives to reduce marine pollution. As part 
of these green initiatives, CSL is constructing 23 Hybrid 
Electric Catamaran Hull Vessels for the Kochi Water 
Metro Project. This project represents a modern, 
technologically advanced, energy-efficient, and 
environmentally friendly solution that will enhance 
the urban water transport system, providing seamless 
transportation for Kochi’s citizens. CSL’s dedication 
to green initiatives is further evidenced by its 
delivery of two Autonomous Electric Vessels to ASKO 
Maritime AS, Norway. Additionally, CSL is building two 
Commissioning Service Operation Vessels, two Zero 
Emission Feeder Container Vessels, and two Hybrid 
Service Operation Vessels for various European clients.

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets

CSL is committed to addressing the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) challenges facing the industry and aligning 
with India’s goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2070. As a CPSU under the Ministry of Ports, Shipping, and Waterways, CSL 
has taken significant steps to contribute to sustainable development.
	
CSL is advancing sustainable maritime solutions through various initiatives. We have delivered India’s first hydrogen-fuelled 
electric vessel to the Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) and have so far delivered 15 out of 23 Hybrid Electric Catamaran 
Hull Vessels for the Kochi Water Metro Project. Additionally, we have delivered two Autonomous Electric Vessels to Norway 
and are currently constructing vessels for European clients, including Commissioning Service Operation Vessels, Zero Emission 
Feeder Container Vessels, and Hybrid Service Operation Vessels. Furthermore, we are building eight Hybrid Electric Catamaran 
Hull Vessels for IWAI, of which two have already been delivered. All these vessels are designed for electric propulsion, reducing 
their environmental impact.
	
In our commitment to renewable energy, CSL is setting up a wind-solar hybrid power plant with a total capacity of about 17 MW. 
This project will generate more green energy than our current average annual consumption, enabling CSL to operate entirely 
on renewable energy and significantly reduce our carbon footprint.
	
These efforts reflect CSL’s dedication to sustainable practices and our role in driving the maritime industry’s green transition.

12.	 Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy work place.
	
The Occupational Health and Safety Management System at Cochin Shipyard, known as the HSE Governance System, fosters a 
positive safety culture by encouraging employees to adhere to safe work practices. To reinforce this commitment, employees are 
rewarded monthly and on National Safety Day for their safe actions. Each employee group selects a Field Safety Representative 
(FSR) to oversee workplace safety. Additionally, a dedicated team of approximately 250 Safety and Fire staff continuously 
monitor activities on vessels, workshops, and skids. These staff members are responsible for issuing work permits as needed 
and issuing violation tokens when unsafe practices are observed.
	
The commitment of top management to safety is further demonstrated through weekly walk-throughs and monthly pep talks 
at worksites by Section Heads, General Managers, and Chief General Managers. CSL meticulously evaluates its subcontractors 
based on their HSE performance and mandates adherence to our rigorous HSE policies and standards. We collaborate closely 
with our subcontractors, ensuring they are equipped with the requisite resources and training to execute their tasks safely. 
Continuously monitoring their HSE performance, we provide constructive feedback to facilitate improvement.
16
COCHIN SHIPYARD LIMITED
	
Recognizing the significance of subcontractors’ HSE performance, we have implemented a robust evaluation process to ensure 
alignment with our HSE standards and regulations. The HSE Star rating represents the annual performance of CSL subcontractors 
in terms of Health, Safety, and Environment aspects. Additionally, an HSE and sustainability management supplier code of 
conduct has been published for suppliers.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If yes, then provide details
	
CSL is setting up a wind-solar hybrid power plant with a total capacity of about 17 MW and is expanding rooftop solar installations 
from 1.5 MWp to 4 MWp in a phased manner. This project aims to generate around 40 million units of green energy annually, 
exceeding CSL’s present average annual energy consumption of 33.5 million units. By transitioning to renewable energy, 
CSL plans to operate on 100% green energy, ensuring a stable energy supply, meeting its energy needs, and supporting its
