Positive
Increase in renewal power

Usage of 100% biomass fuel 
in Uttarakhand plant has 
eliminated the generation of 
Co2 during steam generation 
in Boilers in this plant.
Zero water pollution due to 
maintaining 
zero 
liquid 
discharge in Madurai plant.
Negative
Risk of non-achievement of 
financial goals because of 
exposure to concentrated 
business 
segments 
and 
geographies.
Positive
The initiatives taken by the 
company 
provide 
the 
opportunity to expand its 
business 
into 
a 
larger 
number of segments and 
geographies.
Negative
Raw material and commodity 
pricing 
fluctuations 
have 
direct corelation with the 
profit margins.
Positive
The company has a strong 
development 
program 
in 
place to address emerging 
product 
and 
market 
segments. This should have 
a positive impact on revenue 
and profitability.
In the past, the company's 
operations 
have 
been 
concentrated in a few segments 
and geographies.
• Raw material price volatility can 
affect budgeted product costing.
• Disturbances in global economy 
could lead to supply chain 
disruption, 
thereby 
impact 
on-time delivery of raw materials
The changing nature of the market, 
including the emergence of a rising 
electric vehicle segment provides 
an opportunity to deliver innovative 
products and services.
Demand-Supply mismatch, global 
economic policy changes leading 
to surge in raw material prices and 
reducing company's contribution.
The company has taken initiatives 
to align its organisation structure, 
build organisation capabilities and 
engage with employees.
Standardisation, more of 
commodity inputs that are 
locally available rather than 
speciality 
materials 
and 
cost competitive imports 
from FTA countries are few 
of the business approaches 
done by the company to 
control input costs.
Negative
Lower market demand, Stiff 
competition and inability to 
pass-on 
the 
input 
cost 
increases in full affects the 
company's earnings. 
Positive
The actions initiated are 
targeted at fulfilling the twin 
objectives 
of 
business 
success and an engaged 
workforce.
The 
company 
has 
embarked on a program to 
enlarge its presence in a 
larger number of segments 
(product 
as 
well 
as 
customer). 
In 
addition, 
greater focus on global 
markets has also been 
initiated.
• The company optimises its 
cost by Strategic sourcing 
of seasonal inputs and 
entering into long term 
contracts 
with 
key 
suppliers. 
• 
Supply 
security 
is 
protected with maximising 
domestic business share 
and on-boarding multiple 
vendors for each raw 
material.
The 
Company 
maximises 
the use of renewable energy 
sources. The renewable power 
consumption in Madurai plant 
increased from 71% to 74%.
Company successfully uses 
100% biomass fuel for steam 
generation in the Uttarakhand 
plant. 
Madurai plant maintained zero 
liquid discharge ensuring zero 
water pollution.
Company 
provides 
ESP 
(Electrostatic 
Precipitators) 
in the boiler outlets to ensure 
clean chimneys.

1. Wastewater coming out of cooling towers is treated by an ETP. The reject water from the ETP is further treated through evaporator. 
The reject is converted into the form of salts through the evaporator. The result is the maintenance and sustenance of zero liquid 
discharge.
2. Wastewater from toilets is treated in the STP and recycled. This also contributes to zero liquid discharge.
3. All our boilers are equipped with ESPs to significantly reduce particulate emission and maintain green chimneys.
4. Solid wastes generated from rejected tyres in process defective materials are disposed of through specified recycling contractors.
5. Generated sludge is stored and sold through TNPCB authorized disposal agencies.
6. Ash generated from boilers is sold to fly ash brick manufacturers as raw materials.
