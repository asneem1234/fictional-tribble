Statement by director responsible for the business

During the last financial year, eClerx significantly 
advanced its ESG agenda. The company intensified 
its decarbonization efforts and ensured compliance 
with Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and UN 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
	
In FY 2023-24, we have achieved a twofold increase 
in renewable electricity consumption. This now 
makes up 64% of our total electricity use in India 
and Manila locations covering more than 90% of 
our workforce. We have also expanded our EV fleet 
to reduce emissions from employee commuting. 
Compliant with the NGRBC principles and SEBI 
requirements, we publish our Business Responsibility 
& Sustainability Reports (BRSR) every year to ensure 
transparency and accountability.
	
We continue to promote diversity, equity, inclusion, 
and have ensured that our CSR initiatives focus on 
Education, Employability, and Environment. Through 
these initiatives, we supported the adoption of green 
energy and enhanced climate resilience benefiting 
education from early childhood to university (age 
5-22 years) and supporting skill development and 
job placements for disadvantaged youths (age 18-35 
years). Nationally, our tree plantation drives resulted 
in over 70,000 saplings being planted. Our combined 
efforts positively impacted approximately 15,000 
beneficiaries.
	
Additionally, our employee engagement activities, 
such as upcycling wastepaper, career counselling, 
resume building, communication workshops, job 
readiness programs, and tree plantation drives 
benefited around 24,000 individuals.

ECLERX SERVICES LIMITED  |  Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report
Permanent Employees
Yes. eClerx’s grievance redressal process occurs in four stages, 
beginning with the raising of the grievance. Employees are 
encouraged to promptly bring their grievances to the attention of 
their managers and/or HR Business Partner (HRBP), providing factual 
details and supporting evidence. This is followed by an investigation 
of the grievance, during which the HRBP ensures that all involved 
parties receive a fair hearing. In the third stage, known as the ‘closure’ 
stage, the HRBP receives the final recommendations from the 
investigating authorities (as outlined in the Conduct and Discipline 
Policy), communicates these recommendations to the immediate 
manager, and ensures they are implemented within one working day. 
The final stage, ‘appeal,’ allows employees who are dissatisfied with 
the decision to appeal to the vertical head or HR head within three 
working days of receiving the decision. If it is determined during the 
investigation that the grievance was fabricated with malicious intent, 
strict punitive action will be taken against the employee, as approved 
by both the Head of HR and the Vertical Head.
Other than Permanent Employees
Same as above
7.	
Membership of employees and worker in association(s) or Unions recognised by the listed entity.
	
In accordance with the local laws and constitution 
and to ensure fairness in its labor practices, eClerx 
encourages open conversations with employees, 
that will assist in improving its processes. eClerx 
recognizes and respects the right of employees 
to establish and join organizations which are 
designed to engage in collective bargaining, 
and other initiatives to promote and defend the 
interests of the workforce. No eClerx employee 
is dismissed or otherwise prejudiced for being 
a member of such employee organization or 
because of participation in such organization 
outside of working hours, or within working hours, 
with consent of their line manager. Employees 
enjoy protection against discrimination by virtue 
of their membership of an employee organization 
and their employment is not conditional upon 
an 
employee 
not 
joining 
or 
relinquishing 
membership of such an organization. The above 
practice is in line with the Indian constitution, 
however local laws and labor practices takes 
precedence wherever applicable.

ECLERX SERVICES LIMITED  |  Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report
Notes: 
-	 No independent assessment/evaluation/assurance has been carried out by external agency for FY 2022-23.
-	 The above table included the emissions from our India & Manila operations that constitutes 90% of the workforce. Rest of all 
offices are considered under upstream leased assets as we do not have any operational control over them.
-	 Scope 1 emissions foe eClerx includes the GHG emissions from refrigerant leakage from the AC systems owned and operated 
by eClerx and from fire extinguishers. eClerx has no company owned assets like DG set, vehicles etc.
-	 Data for FY 2022-23 in the above table differs from the published BRSR 2023 report due to the difference in conversion factor 
used for calculating Scope 2 emissions. BRSR 2023 used UNFCCC GHG emission calculator version 2.6 with an emission 
factor of 0.61 kg/kWh and did not take T&D emission factor into consideration. The Scope 2 emission in table above has been 
calculated based on emission factor provided by CEA (Central Electricity Authority of India) available at https://cea.nic.in/
cdm-co2-baseline-database/?lang=en (version 19).
-	 Scope 2 emission reduction in FY 2023-24 is due to more renewable power compared to the previous financial year. The share 
of renewable power in total electricity consumption now stands at 64% in FY 2023-24 for locations in India and Manila, that 
constitutes 90% of the workforce.
-	 *For Scope 2, emission factors of 0.823 kg/kWh and 0.81 kg-CO2/kWh have been considered according to CEA version 19 and 
version 18 for FY 2023-24 and FY 2022-23 respectively for all India locations
-	 *For Scope 2, emission factor of 0.680 kg-CO2/kWh has been considered for Philippines according to the Dept. of Energy 
available at: https://doe.gov.ph/sites/default/files/pdf/energy_statistics/20230725_2021-2022%20key%20energy%20

8.	
Does the entity have any project related to 
reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then 
provide details.
	
eClerx is cognizant of the risks posed by climate 
change and works actively in reducing greenhouse 
gases emissions across its operations and value 
chain. Some of the key initiatives towards reducing 
greenhouse gases are as follows:
	
Scope 1 reduction efforts
–	
Although eClerx has minimal to no Scope 1 
emissions due to its use of leased office spaces and 
outsourced employee transportation, the company 
is committed to reducing its Scope 1 emissions 
by transitioning to refrigerants with lower global 
warming potential (GWP). As part of these efforts, 
eClerx has replaced traditional air conditioning 
gases, such as R22, with more environmentally 
friendly alternatives like Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), 
specifically R410A. R410A offers several advantages, 
including higher heat transfer efficiency, improved 
system performance, and greater cooling capacity. 
Additionally, it has a significantly lower GWP 
compared to R22 and other refrigerants, making it a 
more sustainable choice.
	
Scope 2 reduction efforts
–	
Lighting throughout the office floors is powered 
by energy-efficient LED lamps, and all meeting 
rooms are equipped with motion-sensor lighting. 
The technical facility management team maintains 
the ambient temperature optimally to minimize 
energy consumption.
–	
As of the fiscal year ending March 2024, 94% of 
our total office area in India are located in LEED-
certified buildings. eClerx is also developing a 
global 
facility 
selection 
guideline 
document 
to provide a framework for choosing new 
facilities worldwide. This initiative represents a 
comprehensive approach to reducing greenhouse 
gases and combating climate change. eClerx 
is committed to transitioning to renewable 
electricity. While only 9% of our PAN India location 
electricity consumption in India came from 
renewable sources in FY 2019-20, this figure has 
increased to 66% by the end of FY 2023-24.
	
Scope 3 reduction efforts
–	
As part of its strategy to reduce Scope 3 emissions, 
eClerx is transitioning to electric vehicles for 
daily employee commutes and business-related 
intercity travel. We prioritize booking direct or non-
stop flights for both domestic and international 
travel whenever feasible to minimize emissions 
from layovers and connecting flights. Employees 
are 
actively 
encouraged 
to 
conduct 
virtual 
meetings, webinars, and training sessions to 
reduce the need for travel. Additionally, eClerx 
arranges accommodations for travelers close 
to event venues to minimize additional travel 
using other modes of transportation. Over 90% 
of our sourcing is done domestically, with more 
than 70% from local and neighboring districts, 
further 
reducing 
emissions 
associated 
with 
the transportation of input materials. While 
we upgrade our travel portal, employees will 
gain insight into their GHG footprint and better 
understand their environmental impact.

-	 FY 2022-23 number is different from published BRSR 2023 as waste data from only Mumbai, Pune & Chandigarh 
locations was considered. However, in the current report, data has been collected from PAN India (Mumbai, Pune, 
Chandigarh, Mohali, Gurugram, Coimbatore) and Manila for both FY 2023-24 and FY 2022-23. 
-	 The rise in waste numbers for FY 2023-24 compared to FY 2022-23 reflects the broader scope of reporting. 
-	 For our sales offices outside India, data is not captured since they are remote locations with negligible headcount. 
The data includes our India and Manila offices (accounting for more than 90% of headcount) which generate most 
of the waste.
-	 Battery waste is categorized under e waste as per local WEEE categorization in Manila, Philippines.
-	 All the waste generated is either sent to the landlords for disposal (plastic, bio-medical, construction and demolition, 
paper and food wastes) or to certified vendors/re-cyclers for re-cycling (e-waste and battery waste).
-	 Since eClerx is a services company, it does not generate any radioactive or hazardous waste. Hence these categories 
are not applicable.
-	 Other non-hazardous wastes majorly include paper waste and organic/food waste from cafeteria.
-	 Consolidated revenue from operations is considered for intensity calculation: Rs. 29,255.43 Million (FY 2023- 24), 
Rs. 26,478.97 Million (FY 2022-23).

10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices 
adopted in your establishments. Describe the 
strategy adopted by your company to reduce 
usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your 
products and processes and the practices adopted 
to manage such wastes.
	
As an IT-enabled services and data analytics 
organization, eClerx does not manufacture physical 
products, so the use of hazardous and toxic chemicals 
in manufacturing processes is not applicable. The 
waste generated from operations primarily includes 
e-waste, battery waste, biomedical waste, and other 
non-hazardous waste such as paper and food.
	
Recognizing that waste management is a global 
concern, eClerx is committed to promoting a 
sustainable waste management system as part of 
its environmental responsibility. The company has 
implemented a comprehensive waste segregation 
program 
across 
all 
office 
locations, 
featuring 
designated bins for recyclables, organic waste, and 
general waste. Training sessions are held to educate 
employees and housekeeping staff about the 
importance of segregation at the source. Additionally, 
eClerx carefully tracks and maintains records of the 
waste generated at its offices.
	
E-waste, including personal computers (desktops 
and laptops), mobile phones, printers, cartridges, 
and batteries, is returned to the original vendors 
or authorized resellers, who provide certificates 
confirming the successful recycling and recovery 
of materials. Compliance with e-waste legislation is 
rigorously evaluated to ensure all requirements are 
met before disposal.
	
eClerx has also taken significant steps to enhance 
health and hygiene for its female employees by 
installing hygiene bins and vending machines for 
material procurement and safe disposal. These 
machines have been placed in all female restrooms 
at one of our facilities and are being gradually 
expanded to other locations..

–	 -	 No independent assessment/evaluation/assurance has been carried out by external agency.
-	 Scope 3 for FY 2022-23 includes data for offices in India and covers two categories, namely, Category 6: 
Business Travel (limited to India) and Category 7: Employee Commute (limited to company transport -India) 
only.
-	 For FY 2022-23, UNFCCC GHG Calculator version 2.6 was used for GHG calculation.
-	 Consolidated revenue from operations is considered for intensity calculation: Rs. 29,255.43 Million (FY 2023- 24), 
Rs. 26,478.97 Million (FY 2022-23).
-	 In the above table, intensity calculation has been done based on consolidated revenue from operations and 
hence difference can be seen in intensity for FY 2022-23 from the last year’s report.
-	 For FY 2023-24, the ambit of Scope 3 has been extended to cover all the categories as per the details 
mentioned below:
	
●Category 1: Purchased goods and services 
and Category 2: Capital goods.
Emission: 2,203 MTCO2e
Basis of calculation: Spend based method has 
been used to estimate the emissions from our 
purchased goods and services and capital goods. 
United States Environmentally-Extended Input-
Output (USEEIO) emission factors published 
by United States Environmental Protection 
Agency (USEPA) have been considered for 
estimation. The same are available at: https://
cfpub.epa.gov/si/si_public_record_report.
cfm?Lab=CESER&dirEntryId=349324
	
●Category 3: Fuel and electricity related emission.
This is included in Scope 2 calculation above.
	
●Category 4: Upstream transportation and 
distribution.
Emissions are not reported separately to avoid 
double counting, as they are already included 
in the cradle-to-shelf emissions of purchased 
goods and services.
	
●Category 5: Waste generated in operations.
	
●Emission: 1.3 MTCO2e
Basis of calculation: Emissions from this 
category are relatively less since eClerx is a 
service organization and does not produce 
any physical goods. Major types of waste are 
e-wastes, battery wastes, plastic, paper and 
organic wastes. Waste-type-specific emission 
factors have been considered as per DEFRA 
23 for estimation. The same is available at: 
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/
greenhouse-gas-reporting-conversion-factors-2023.
	
●Category 6: Business travel. 
	
●Emission: 1,434 MTCO2e
Basis of calculation: Distance based method 
of estimation is used for all domestic and 
international air travels and surface travels 
originating from India. ‘Travelution’, an internal 
web portal provides an integrated solution 
for all travel needs for travels originating from 
India and captures the mode and distance. 
Additionally, 
data 
from 
claims 
made 
by 
employees post travel have been considered 
for estimation. 
Spend based method is used for estimating 
emissions from travels for outside India 
offices. 
Emission factors from ESEEIO, ICAO and DEFRA 
are considered for estimation. https://www.icao.

●Category 7: Employee commute.
Emission: 5,585 MTCO2e
Basis of calculation: eClerx carried out an 
extensive survey to gather data regarding 
employee commuting habits. The survey was 
conducted across the offices in India and Manila 
that covers more than 90% of our workforce. The 
survey covered various aspects such as mode of 
transport, fuel types of personal vehicles used, 
work from home requests, carpool, etc. The 
results from the survey are used for estimating 
emissions for self-travelling employees. 
Additionally, eClerx has a centralized internal tool 
called “Fleetstar” to capture data of employees 
using company provided transport. The data 
from “Fleetstar” is used to calculate the distance 
and mode of transport (car/bus) which was 
provided by the Transport team. 
Further, distance-based methods have been 
used to estimate the emissions from employee 
commute using DEFRA and CEA emission 
factors.
	
●Category 8: Upstream Leased Assets.
Emission: 185 MTCO2e
Basis of calculation: In the context of eClerx, this 
includes emissions form the leased office spaces 
outside India, since these are relatively smaller 
offices spaces with less than 10% of the overall 
headcount. Emissions from CLX entities are not 
included due to lack of data availability. 
Electricity consumption for USA offices are 
estimated based on office area and climate zone 
wise per square foot consumption from US EPA 
commercial building consumption survey data.
(https://www.eia.gov/consumption/commercial/
data/2018/index.php?view=consumption) 
Asset specific method based on floor space area 
and lease contracts shared by on-site POCs has 
been used to estimate the emissions. DEFRA and 
US EPA emission factors have been considered.
	
●Categories 9 to 15 are not applicable to eClerx 
since it is an IT enabled service organization and 
does not manufacture any physical products 
to be sold to consumers. Also, eClerx does 
not have any franchises nor has it invested 
in any company/asset that generates carbon 
emissions.

Outcome of  the initiative
1
Modular UPS 
selection & 
installation 
–	 Energy efficient UPS systems give 96% to 99% 
power efficiency due to advance power saving 
technology, as against a normal UPS system 
which generally gives 80-85% efficiency 
–	 Conventional UPS systems take up more space 
as they are typically extended horizontally on the 
floor however modular UPS typically increase 
vertically in the rack along with the batteries 
thereby using less floor space 
–	 Less heat dissipation and noise level compared to 
conventional UPS 
–	 5% saving in electrical 
consumption & cost 
compared to conventional 
UPS 
–	 Increased operational 
life by almost 3 years 
compared to conventional 
UPS 
2
Li ion battery 
installation for 
UPS
–	 Lithium-Ion batteries don’t contain cadmium (a 
toxic heavy metal) and are better for environment 
–	 Operating temperature for LI batteries is 30o C 
to 35o C and SMF batteries is 25o C. resulting 
to HVAC electricity consumption saving in 
maintaining room temperature 
–	 Size & weight of LI battery is less as compared to 
SMF type battery and hence it requires 50% less 
footprint as compared to SMF type battery 
–	 Design / operational life of LI battery is 10-12 years 
as compared to SMF type battery having design 
operational life of 3-4 years only 
5% saving in electrical 
consumption & cost 
compared to conventional 
battery
