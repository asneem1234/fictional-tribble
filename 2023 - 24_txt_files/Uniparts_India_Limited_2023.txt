1
Product Quality 
and Design
Opportunity
By prioritising quality and design, we can minimise 
product failures, recalls, and waste, shrinking our 
environmental impact. Sustainable design allows 
us to craft energy-efficient products. Furthermore, 
quality improvements benefit both workers (safer 
production) and end-users (enhanced product 
safety). This focus aligns our business with ESG 
goals, meeting stakeholder expectations - from 
investors seeking responsible practices to customers 
and employees desiring safe, long-lasting products.
Not Applicable
Positive
2
Economic  
Performance
Opportunity
We can achieve a win-win by focusing on 
economic prosperity, environmental stewardship, 
and social responsibility. By improving efficiency 
and profitability, we gain the resources to invest 
in sustainable practices, innovation, and social 
programs. This virtuous cycle leads to long-term 
success, satisfied stakeholders, and attracts investors 
who share our values of ESG responsibility.
Not Applicable
Positive
3
Occupational Health 
and Safety
Opportunity
By prioritising Occupational Health and Safety, 
we can effectively lower accident rates, reduce 
injuries, and decrease absenteeism, thereby 
fostering a more productive workforce. Additionally, 
fostering a safety-conscious culture can boost 
employee morale, increase loyalty, and enhance 
job satisfaction. Through the implementation of 
comprehensive health and safety protocols, we not 
only meet the expectations of stakeholders such 
as employees, customers, and investors, but also 
cultivate a strong reputation as a responsible and 
sustainable business entity.

Training and 
Upskilling of Human 
Capital
Opportunity
Enhancing productivity, fostering innovation, and 
boosting employee satisfaction are key drivers 
towards achieving higher profitability. Furthermore, 
dedicating resources to employee development 
initiatives can facilitate social mobility and mitigate 
income inequality, thus fostering broader economic 
and social advancement within the region. Through 
prioritising employee training and upskilling, we 
underscore our dedication to responsible and 
sustainable business strategies, aligning with the 
expectations of stakeholders, including employees, 
investors, and customers.
Not Applicable
Positive
5
Risk Management
Opportunity
We can identify and mitigate potential risks, 
including those related to the environment, society, 
and governance. A robust risk management strategy 
can reduce the likelihood of negative incidents, 
such as legal violations, reputational damage, and 
environmental disasters. Ultimately, a focus on 
risk management can help us align our business 
operations with ESG goals and meet the expectations 
of stakeholders, including investors, customers, and 
employees.
Not Applicable
Positive
Risk
In case we are unable to identify and mitigate 
risks related to environmental impacts, labour 
practices, or governance, the same can lead to 
legal liabilities, reputational damage, and financial 
losses. Additionally, inadequate risk management 
can negatively impact employee safety and well-
being and harm the surrounding communities. 
Therefore, failure to prioritise risk management can 
pose significant ESG risks for the company and its 
stakeholders.
We review risk management 
framework and processes 
regularly. We are also regularly 
monitoring risk management 
performance and implementing 
appropriate controls and 
processes. Additionally, we 
prioritise employee training and 
awareness-raising to ensure that 
all employees are aware of the 
potential risks and mitigation 
measures

Data Security, Privacy, 
and Cybersecurity
Risk
Inadequate measures to protect sensitive data and 
information can lead to legal liabilities, reputational 
damage and financial losses. Moreover, cyber-
attacks can compromise customer data and 
confidential information, negatively impacting 
the company's reputation and stakeholder trust. 
The potential for data breaches and cyber-attacks 
is increasing, and failure to prioritise data security, 
privacy and cybersecurity can result in significant 
ESG risks for the company and its stakeholders. 
We regularly review and update 
our data security protocols, 
provide regular employee 
training and awareness-raising, 
and implementing appropriate 
controls and processes to protect 
sensitive data and information. 
We also work with cybersecurity 
experts to identify potential threats 
and developed a comprehensive 
incident response plan. By 
prioritising data security, privacy, 
and cybersecurity, we can reduce 
the likelihood of data breaches 
and cyber-attacks, and ultimately 
build a strong reputation as a 
responsible and sustainable 
business.
Negative
7
Governance/Values, 
Ethics and Compliance
Risk
Failure to uphold ethical standards and comply with 
regulations can lead to legal liabilities, reputational 
damage and financial losses. Additionally, 
inadequate governance practices can harm 
stakeholder trust and negatively impact employee 
morale. By not prioritising good governance, 
ethical behavior and regulatory compliance, we 
risk damaging our reputation and stakeholder trust. 
Thus, it is crucial for us to identify and mitigate ESG 
risks associated with governance, values, ethics, and 
compliance. 
We have developed and 
implemented a comprehensive 
code of conduct that outlines 
ethical behavior and compliance 
with regulations. We also 
have an independent board 
and committees to ensure 
transparency and accountability in 
decision-making. Additionally, we 
prioritise employee training and 
awareness-raising on ethics and 
compliance issues and implement 
appropriate controls and processes 
to identify and address potential 
issues.

Water and Waste-Water 
Management
Opportunity
We can reduce our environmental impact and 
operational costs, enhance our reputation, and 
improve stakeholder engagement. Sustainable water 
management practices can include implementing 
water-efficient technologies, reducing water usage, 
and increasing wastewater treatment and recycling. 
Similarly, sustainable waste management practices 
can include promoting recycling and reuse, reducing 
waste generation, and implementing proper waste 
disposal methods. Prioritising sustainable water 
and wastewater management practices presents us 
with the opportunity to drive long-term value and 
contribute to sustainable development.
Not Applicable
Positive
Risk 
Inadequate management of water resources 
and wastewater can lead to water scarcity, water 
pollution, and negative impacts on ecosystems and 
human health. Moreover, regulatory frameworks and 
public pressure are increasing to address water-
related environmental issues. Failure to manage 
water resources and wastewater responsibly can 
lead to legal liabilities, reputational damage, and 
financial losses. Thus, it is crucial for us to identify 
and mitigate ESG risks associated with water and 
wastewater management.
To mitigate the ESG risks 
associated with water and 
wastewater management, we have 
implemented several approaches. 
This includes implementing 
water conservation measures, 
reducing water usage, and 
increasing wastewater treatment 
and recycling. We also strive to 
work with local stakeholders, such 
as communities and government 
bodies, to identify water-related 
risks and implement sustainable 
water management practices.

10.	Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the 
strategy adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your 
products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
Uniparts has implemented waste management practices to reduce the usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals by 
following these measures:
	
Storage:
•	
ETP sludge/paint sludge is filled in leak-proof HDPE (High Density Polyethylene) bags that are labelled and 
stored in an impervious leachate-proof room.
•	
Used oil and waste are stored in barrels that are clearly labelled and kept under cover.
	
Treatment:
•	
ETP sludge and paint sludge are routed through an authorised treatment storage disposal facility. Specifically, 
ETP sludge is securely landfilled at the TSFD site in adherence to all applicable regulations and standards.
•	
Waste oil, used oil and waste batteries are periodically sold to CPCB-approved waste recyclers. This approach 
ensures that these materials are effectively managed and recycled in a safe, responsible, and sustainable 
manner.
