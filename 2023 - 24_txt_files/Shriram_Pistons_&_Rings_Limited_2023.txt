Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If Yes, provide details of its coverage and 
implementation.
Yes, our plant operations in India are located in the state of Uttar Pradesh, which has become zero liquid discharge during 
the year & plant in Rajasthan is already a Zero Liquid Discharge plant. In addition, the effluent from the plants is treated in 
state-of-the-art ETP/STP and treated through RO system, the treated water is utilized for processes and secondary purposes 
such as toilet flushing and/or maintaining greenbelt development within the plant premises.
The management of treated effluents generated during the plant operations and their disposal is outlined in the individual 
plant operating consent orders issued by the respective State Pollution Control Boards, which our plants diligently adhere 
to.  Aligned with these consent orders/authorizations, our plants have implemented comprehensive tertiary treatment to 
recycle treated effluents for process reuse.
Moving forward, our approach shall embrace a holistic perspective, encompassing all aspects of water sourcing and its 
efficient utilization. Our ongoing efforts are reducing freshwater usage by increasing treated water in our processes and for 
other sanitation purposes. Furthermore, efforts are on to increase water augmentation through rainwater harvesting and 
recharge within the plant and outside premises.
