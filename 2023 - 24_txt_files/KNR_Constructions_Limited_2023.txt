BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITY  
& SUSTAINABILITY REPORT
(Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) is the practice of companies disclosing information 
about their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance. It goes beyond financial reporting to 
provide stakeholders with a comprehensive view of a company’s non-financial impacts and contributions to 
sustainable development. BRSR covers topics such as environmental impact, social responsibility, and governance 
practices, aiming to promote transparency and accountability.)

 1
Emissions & 
Effluents
R
Construction is an energy-intensive 
activity and generates significant 
direct and indirect greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions, including carbon 
dioxide and methane from fuel 
use. Uncontrolled pollutants and 
emissions 
during 
operation 
and 
associated activities impose legal and 
Environmental risks for the Company.
The Company has taken measures to mitigate 
environmental impacts. It has implemented 
effective exhaust systems for its machinery 
and vehicles, conducting regular assessments 
to ensure efficiency. Additionally, sprinkler 
systems have been introduced along conveyors 
that transport aggregates within the crushers, 
aimed at minimising the release of airborne 
emissions. The organisation also carries out 
consistent monitoring of emissions to enhance 
its emission management strategies

O
Companies are evaluated according 
to the resource consumption and 
carbon intensity of their real estate 
assets, their potential vulnerability 
to environmental construction rules, 
and their efforts to enhance the 
environmental performance of their 
real estate assets.
NA
Positive
 4
Climate 
change
R
Climate change is impacting almost 
all geographies and industries. It 
can pose physical risks such as 
floods, wildfires and can impact the 
structural integrity of infrastructure. 
It can also pose transitional risks 
such as compulsory use of renewable 
energy, change in regulations, etc.
Typically, our operational planning takes 
into account potential disruptions caused 
by weather and climatic variations, ensuring 
minimal impact on our activities. Given the 
potential risks posed by climate change, 
including unexpected rainfall, floods, and 
temperature fluctuations, we have integrated 
protective drainage systems into our work 
sites to prevent flooding. Moreover, we select 
materials like resilient bitumen that can 
withstand the challenges presented by climate 
fluctuations, thereby ensuring the durability of 
our completed projects. Our approach involves 
the careful implementation of suitable mix 
designs, demonstrating a cautious approach 
to 
address 
these 
climatic 
uncertainties 
effectively.

Water and 
Wastewater 
Management
R
Water is a critical resource required 
during construction, operation and 
maintenance. Water use for various 
business activities impacts the quality 
and quantity of local water resources. 
Improper discharge of water can 
result in contamination of water 
bodies. This may lead to a negative 
impact on operating costs and may 
impose a legal risk to the Company.
Preserving 
water 
is 
crucial 
for 
future 
generations. Water is also necessary in 
construction and maintenance. We regularly 
test water bodies near construction zones to 
ensure quality and safety. Sprinkler systems are 
utilised to manage water efficiently, optimising 
its usage in activities like compacting soil and 
reducing dust in plants, notably crushers and 
access roads. Water recycling innovations 
have been explored for curing in casting yards. 
Similarly, repurposed wastewater contributes 
to 
landscaping, 
gardening, 
and 
median 
and ROW plantations. Our commitment to 
sustainable water management is evident 
through these initiatives.
Negative

Waste 
Management
O
The Circular Economy model of 
production 
and 
consumption 
promotes the reusing, refurbishing 
and recycling of existing materials 
and products. The transition to a 
circular economy will affect a change 
in building design and material usage. 
A shift in regulations and demand, 
combined with new technology, has 
the potential to reduce costs.
NA

Biodiversity 
Protection & 
Conservation
R
Biodiversity 
protection 
and 
conservation 
includes 
monitoring 
the ecological impacts of our project 
areas before and after development 
to minimise negative impacts on the 
local ecosystem.
Before initiating any project development, 
the relevant Government Authority ensures 
proper forest and environmental clearances, 
preempting potential issues during project 
execution. We seek approvals for plant 
establishment 
and 
operation, 
diligently 
adhering to mitigation measures mandated 
by regulations. Continuous monitoring of 
soil, water, and air parameters guides us in 
implementing necessary mitigation actions 
if 
thresholds 
get 
exceeded.Strategically 
positioned tall barricades  and lush plantations 
are incorporated  on plant premises to minimize 
pollution dissemination from plant operations.
To counterbalance tree removal, we plant 
multiple times the number of trees cut within 
roadways and explore tree transplantation 
wherever feasible, showcasing our dedication 
to biodiversity protection and conservation.

Employee 
Wellbeing and

R
A higher employee retention rate 
reflects 
good 
company 
policies 
and practices that lead to higher 
employee 
satisfaction. 
However, 
a high attrition rate indicates low 
employee satisfaction. High attrition 
also increases the cost of replacing 
and training the employees, increases 
the risk of business getting impacted 
in case of critical roles and may reflect 
negatively on investors.
The management possesses the ability to 
identify individuals in need and provide them 
with training in relevant fields for potential 
deployment in projects. Adequate pathways for 
advancement are offered, allowing employees 
to progress in their roles. The Company’s 
employee-centric policies and supportive 
welfare initiatives ensure high retention rates. 
Effective mentoring across various levels 
significantly contributes to staff retention. The 
Company’s consistent financial stability can 
be attributed to the valuable contribution of a 
well-maintained staff across all functions

Product 
Quality
R
Companies 
in 
the 
infrastructure 
industry have a vital responsibility 
to safeguard their projects through 
the provision of engineering, design, 
architectural and other services. 
Only 
by 
ensuring 
compliance 
with safety standards can they 
demonstrate professional excellence 
and 
guarantee 
top-tier 
results. 
Poor design and construction of 
buildings or infrastructure can have 
devastating consequences- from loss 
of life, to decreased property value, to 
economic insecurity. Taking the time 
for proper planning is essential in 
order to prevent these disasters from 
occurring. 
When it comes to structural integrity 
and safety, companies that don’t 
do well can face high costs for 
redesigning or repair, as well as 
legal liabilities and damage to their 
reputation, which could harm their 
growth prospects. 
As a consequence of climate change, 
companies in the construction and 
infrastructure industry must now 
consider 
how 
changing 
weather 
patterns could damage their projects 
– potentially endangering public 
safety. Compliance with the minimum 
codes and standards may not be 
enough to retain reputational value.
Over time, KNRCL has consistently employed 
comprehensive Quality Assurance (QA) and 
Quality Control (QC) protocols to ensure the 
durability and excellence of our executed 
projects, encompassing roads, structures, 
reservoir bunds, canal systems, and more. 
Our successful completion of Defect Liability 
Periods across all projects serves as evidence 
of our commitment to maintaining stringent 
quality standards during project execution. 
The monetisation of road assets executed 
under the Hybrid Annuity Model (HAM) further 
validates the assured quality embedded within 
our projects, offering a tangible assurance of 
the high standards we promise and deliver

Human Rights 
and Labour 
Management
R
Construction 
is 
labour-intensive 
and has been the focus of human 
rights 
organisations 
for 
their 
labour management practices. The 
complexity of their workforce (size, 
labour 
intensity, 
and 
operational 
locations), 
management-labour 
interactions, the effectiveness of 
worker rights and the effectiveness 
of engagement with their workers is 
crucial for the Company
The Company adeptly manages its substantial 
workforce across diverse projects, strictly 
adhering to governmental regulations that 
ensure secure working environments, suitable 
residential provisions near sites, and equitable 
wages. Our commitment to labor management 
is 
underscored 
by 
deploying 
dedicated 
coordinators who address basic needs at all 
times. We prioritise human rights by promptly 
addressing deviations when observed to 
ensure the well-being and dignity of our 
workforce.
Negative
14
Community 
Engagement
R
Construction activities contribute to 
social and economic development. 
However, they can also create a 
risk for local communities and 
the 
environment. 
Activities 
such 
as clearing, grading, and using 
hazardous chemicals can negatively 
impact the local community. In some 
situations, environmental concerns 
and 
resistance 
from 
the 
local 
community can lead to project delays 
and, in the worst-case scenario, 
project cancellations. This can have 
a negative impact on the Company’s 
profitability and the opportunities it 
has for growth.
The Company strategically assigns a dedicated 
Manager to facilitate ongoing interaction with 
the local community, ensuring the smooth 
progression of projects. Recognising the 
significance of community engagement, the 
Company 
addresses 
grievances 
through 
Corporate 
Social 
Responsibility 
(CSR) 
endeavours, including initiatives such as 
constructing village roads, facilitating drinking 
water access, and supporting self-help groups. 
The effectiveness of these efforts is amplified 
when the community comprehends the 
positive impact and benefits derived from asset 
development, be it roads, irrigation facilities, 
or urban assets. Encouraging community 
ownership and fostering identification with the 
development yields noteworthy results.

Compliance 
and Business 
Ethics
R
The key area relevant to business 
ethics 
is 
the 
management 
of 
issues such as fraud, executive 
misconduct, corrupt practices, money 
laundering, or anti-trust violations. 
Ethics violations can lead to police 
investigations, hefty fines, settlement 
costs, and damage to reputation.
The Company meticulously adheres to the 
internal financial control guidelines endorsed 
by the Board. The Company places utmost 
importance on compliance with a range of 
pertinent regulations, prioritising financial 
reporting accuracy and safeguarding data 
privacy throughout its business operations.
The Audit Committee oversees quarterly 
financial reporting authorised by the Board, 
disseminating 
crucial 
information 
to 
stakeholders, investors, and stock exchanges. 
Over the past 14 years, consistent dividends 
and a comprehensive risk mitigation policy 
underscore the Company’s commitment to 
compliance and business ethics. The accolade 
of top credit ratings from CRISIL and ICRA 
serve as evidence of KNRCL’s dedication to 
these principles.
Negative
16
Corporate 
Governance
R
Businesses are assessed based on 
their performance across all key 
governance issues, which include 
ownership & control, Board pay, 
accounting, business ethics, and tax 
transparency. This topic examines 
the effect that a company’s corporate 
governance and business ethics 
practices have on its shareholders 
and other investors.
The Board of Directors convenes regularly to 
oversee a spectrum of corporate governance 
matters 
encompassing 
accountability, 
transparency, ethical decision making, and 
more. An internal audit is conducted, with 
the resulting report submitted to the Board 
for assessment and confirmation of these 
aspects. This practice is well-received by 
shareholders and investors, signifying a 
commendable level of corporate governance 
reasonableness within the Company.
Negative
17
Data Privacy 
and Security
R
Companies are assessed based on 
the amount of personal data they 
collect, their exposure to evolving 
or increasing privacy regulations, 
their vulnerability to potential data

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets and 
achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
Dear Stakeholders,
As the director responsible for the Business Responsibility Report, I am pleased to present an overview of our ESG initiatives 
to our esteemed shareholders. Our commitment to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles forms the 
foundation of our business philosophy.
Environment: We have implemented effective exhaust mechanisms for machinery and vehicles, with regular checks to 
ensure optimal performance. Sprinklers on conveyors help reduce air emissions from aggregate crushers, supported by 
consistent emissions monitoring. Our electricity consumption is managed through captive sources like generators. We 
optimize waste materials from structures and pavements, using them in diversion roads and construction layers. Our focus 
on waste reduction, reusing, and efficient water use underscores our commitment to environmental sustainability.
Social: Our social initiatives include identifying and training individuals for project deployment, fostering career progression 
opportunities, and maintaining high employee retention through supportive policies and welfare activities. Our mentoring 
programs contribute to staff retention and consistent performance.
Governance: Governance is a cornerstone of our operations. Frequent Board meetings ensure accountability, transparency, 
ethical decision-making, and adherence to business ethics. Internal audits reinforce our commitment to sound governance 
practices, enhancing shareholder and investor confidence.
In conclusion, our ESG initiatives encompass environmental sustainability, social empowerment, and robust governance 
practices. We are dedicated to addressing challenges, meeting targets, and fostering responsible growth, guided by our 
commitment to creating lasting value for all stakeholders. We appreciate your ongoing support and confidence in our 
organization. Together, we are poised to build a brighter and more sustainable future.
Sincerely, 
K Jalandhar Reddy Executive Director
