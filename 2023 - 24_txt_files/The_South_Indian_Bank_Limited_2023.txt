Risk
•	 Cyber threats to banking 
system. 
•	 Launch of Bank’s lending 
product through mobile 
banking and internet 
Banking channel.
•	 Various SMS and Email 
facilities.
The risk of a data 
breach poses a threat 
to the exposure of our 
customers’ personally 
identifiable information, 
which in turn impacts 
our business relationship 
with them. This potential 
breach jeopardizes the 
confidentiality, integrity 
and security of sensitive 
customer data, potentially 
leading to breaches of 
trust and damaging our 
reputation.
IT Strategy Committee of the 
Board, IT Steering Committee 
and Information Security 
Committee are in place. Cyber 
security preparedness of the 
Bank is reviewed by Information 
Security Committee and IT 
Strategy Committee. The 
Bank has deployed FRM with 
AI capability to strengthen 
the Bank’s applications and 
mitigate fraudulent attempts 
through behavioural analysis 
and identification of risk 
patterns. Security control 
applications such as WAF (Web 
Application Firewall), SIEM 
(Security Information and Event 
Management) and HIPS (Host 
Intrusion Prevention System) 
have been implemented to further 
strengthen security. The Bank 
has Internet Banking facility from 
Infosys which provides all the 
workflow capabilities required 
for each corporate. Moreover, 
it offers the security of Digital 
certificate integration thereby 
balancing convenience with 
security. IT Departments including 
Data Centre, DR Site & BCP site

certified for the implementation of 
Information Security Management 
System (ISMS). As a part of 
ISMS implementation, the 
Bank has prepared IS Security 
Policy and related IT risk 
management procedures. The 
Bank has put in place a number 
of security solutions to manage 
cyber-attacks. The Bank has 
implemented multiple advanced 
security solutions to protect 
IT infrastructure, employees, 
customers, partners etc. from 
malware, advanced persistent 
threats, denial of service type 
of attacks and variety of other 
threats and malicious attacks. 
The Bank has finetuned the 
information security systems in 
accordance with RBI guidelines.
Positive: Improved 
turnaround time 
with customer 
satisfaction.
Negative: In the 
unfortunate case 
of a data breach, 
the Bank would 
experience adverse 
effects on its 
business operations.
This could include 
disruptions to 
services, financial 
losses, damage to 
the Bank’s reputation 
and erosion of 
customer trust.
Additionally, such 
incidents would 
increase the risk 
of regulatory 
scrutiny and 
potential penalties 
from regulatory 
authorities.

Ethical 
Behaviour
Risk
Adhering to ethical 
behaviour underscores 
the Bank’s dedication 
to promoting ethical 
behaviour and maintaining 
integrity in all its dealings. 
By prioritizing ethical 
conduct, the Bank aims to 
not only retain its existing 
customer base but also 
attract new customers 
to the Bank. Upholding 
these values fosters trust, 
strengthens relationships 
and reinforces the Bank’s 
reputation as a responsible 
and trustworthy financial 
institution.
The Bank has a strong 
governance framework in place 
to ensure that it is operating in a 
responsible and ethical manner. 
The framework is based on 
transparency, accountability, 
fairness and compliance. The 
Bank’s governance practices 
promote fairness, inclusivity, and 
responsible decision-making, 
reflecting its dedication to 
upholding the highest ethical 
standards in all aspects of its 
operations. Conduct for the 
Board of Directors and Core 
Management Personnel of the 
Bank, as required under SEBI 
(LODR) Regulations, 2015 “on 
Corporate Governance.” The 
confirmation from the Managing 
Director & CEO regarding 
compliance with the code by 
all the Directors and Senior 
Management Personnel forms 
part of the Report. The Code of 
Conduct and Ethics is displayed 
on the website of the Bank. 
Negative: Unethical 
behaviour could 
directly impact 
the reputation of 
the Bank. It could 
also lead to loss of 
morale and employee 
productivity thereby 
affecting the top-line 
growth. By upholding 
ethical standards 
and treating both 
customers and 
employees with 
integrity and 
respect, the Bank 
cultivates a positive 
work environment 
and strengthens 
relationships with 
customer. The Bank 
has implemented 
3-way replication 
also for most critical 
applications, to 
achieve minimum 
data loss.

Systematic 
Risk 
Management
Risk 
This ensures financial 
stability, regulatory 
compliance and protection 
of stakeholders. It 
facilitates business 
continuity, reputation 
management and long-
term sustainability by 
identifying, assessing, 
and mitigating potential 
risks effectively. These 
risks may stem from 
various sources, including 
financial, technological or 
lending risk. Such events 
or sequences of events 
possess the capacity to 
undermine or jeopardize 
the stability of the overall 
system. 
Various initiatives such as 
comprehensive review of 
Credit Risk Policy and other 
Risk Management Policies have 
been conducted. Liquidity is 
also actively being managed 
through the ALCO forum, 
where the Bank is pursuing 
actively into increasing the 
sticky and retail deposits along 
with operationalising majority 
of the wholesale banking 
financing relationships. As part 
of the Business Continuity 
Management, the Bank’s 
Operational Risk team is 
working in close coordination 
with various stakeholders 
to ensure smooth conduct 
of operations. The senior 
level executive committees 
like Credit Risk Management 
Committee (CRMC), Market 
Risk Management Committee 
(MRMC), Operational Risk 
Management Committee 
(ORMC) and Asset Liability 
Management Committee (ALCO) 
develop the risk management 
policies and vet the risk limits to 
ensure better control.
Negative: Failure 
to address any 
unmitigated risk 
with the potential 
to escalate into a 
systemic risk could 
have detrimental 
effects on the Bank’s 
performance. Such 
risks pose a threat 
to the stability and 
integrity of the 
financial system, 
potentially leading 
to disruptions, 
financial losses and 
reputational damage.

Financial 
Inclusion
Opportunity
Expanding financial 
inclusion opens up access 
to banking services for 
currently marginalized 
and underprivileged 
communities, creating an 
effect of positive societal 
impact and contributes 
to the broader economic 
development and stability 
of society. Increase in 
business lending leads to 
higher turnover and better 
reach. 
11% and 49% of branches are 
present in rural and semi-urban 
areas respectively.
Positive: Financial 
inclusion boosts 
Bank’s profitability 
by expanding 
the customer 
base, increasing 
deposits and 
fostering product 
diversification, while 
also enhancing 
reputation.

Employee

Development
Opportunity
This boosts efficiency, 
reduces employee attrition, 
increases capabilities and 
creativity within the bank 
and enhances diversity 
which in turn enhances 
customer experience.
The Bank has sustained 
its Employee Recognition 
module, continuing the 
monthly recognition newsletter 
to showcase outstanding 
contributions and foster a 
culture of appreciation. The HR 
Department conducted multiple 
leadership training sessions, 
collaborating with institutions 
like IIM Bangalore, to enhance 
the strategic thinking, leadership 
abilities, and management skills 
of executive cadre employees, 
thereby strengthening the 
leadership pipeline. To optimize 
the tooth-to-tail ratio, aiming 
for 85% of the workforce 
in customer-facing roles, a 
dedicated team streamlined 
processes and reallocated 
resources, demonstrating 
significant progress towards this 
ideal balance. Recognizing the 
pivotal role of customer-facing 
employees, the Bank undertook 
initiatives such as strategic 
staff relocation to branches and 
specialized training programs to 
enhance frontline staff skills and 
align them with industry trends. 
The introduction of a Learning 
Management System (LMS) via 
web and mobile applications 
supports continuous learning 
and professional development, 
emphasizing the Bank’s 
commitment to the personal 
and professional growth of 
its workforce. Technological 
advancements, including 
enhanced IT support for 
recruitment, and improved 
training management features 
through the SIB mHRMS 
mobile app, have simplified 
administrative tasks and 
fostered digital transformation. 
Positive: A strong 
workforce with 
higher engagement, 
retention rate and 
diversity in the 
workforce brings 
new perspectives, 
experiences and 
ideas which enable 
innovation, enhances 
the performance 
and enables a 
positive culture in 
the organization 
and highlights the 
bank’s efforts toward 
creating a conducive 
work environment.

Regulatory 
& Legal 
Compliances
Risk  
Risk of non-compliance 
exposes the Bank to legal 
penalties and financial 
losses resulting from failure 
to comply with the industry 
laws and regulations. 
Failure to adhere to the 
laws would directly affect 
the Bank’s revenue, 
valuations and could lead 
to loss of reputation and 
business opportunities. 
More compliant banks 
tend to have improved 
performances and better 
process efficiency. 
Compliance gives 
assurance and provides 
a broader insight to the 
investors.
The Bank has institutionalised 
a strong compliance culture 
and mechanism across the 
organisation, in pursuit of its 
strategic goals of transparency 
and trust, among all its 
stakeholders. The Bank has 
a dedicated independent 
Compliance Department 
headed by a Senior General 
Manager which operates 
as per a well-documented 
compliance policy for ensuring 
regulatory compliance, across 
all businesses and operations. 
The key functions of the 
department include tracking of 
regulatory updates affecting 
various business verticals of 
the Bank, dissemination of 
regulatory updates to functional 
units, monitoring of timely 
implementation of regulatory 
instructions, review of processes 
from a regulatory compliance 
perspective, providing guidance 
on compliance-related matters, 
vetting of Bank’s policies and 
internal guidelines, imparting 
training to employees on 
compliance aspects among 
others. The Bank has a 
well-defined and structured 
mechanism to assess the 
compliance risk and monitor its 
mitigation measures, thereby 
ensuring the effectiveness of the 
compliance function in managing 
the compliance risk.
Negative: Non-
compliance would 
lead to loss of 
reputation and 
consequently 
affect the business 
activities. Banks who 
are compliant with 
the regulatory laws 
have a better ability 
to manage risks 
and builds a better 
sense of fairness 
and loyalty among 
employees.

GHG 
Emissions 
Management
Opportunity
Assessing the 
environmental impact of 
the Bank’s own operations 
is a focus area. If these 
risks are not properly 
managed, they could 
negatively impact the 
operations and profitability. 
This also attracts scrutiny 
from stakeholders/
investors and generates 
a public perception of the 
Bank.
The Bank is continually taking 
proactive action towards 
addressing climate change, 
reducing carbon footprint, 
minimising waste and pollution, 
and promoting sustainable 
energy and infrastructure 
development. The Bank has 
initiated steps to provide 
provision for Solar power 
generation in new buildings 
under construction, wherever 
possible.
It is our duty to protect and 
improve the environment. The 
Bank is committed to minimising 
its impact on the environment 
and managing environmental 
risks effectively. 
Positive: GHG 
emissions 
management 
allows banks to 
mitigate risks, invest 
in low- carbon 
systems, fostering 
sustainability 
and market 
differentiation.
12
ESG 
Oversight
Opportunity
Having an efficacious ESG 
oversight on the Board 
level will augment the 
overall ESG performance 
and reflect the Bank’s 
commitment to integrating 
responsible business 
practices within its growth 
model. Integrating ESG 
into the business practices 
would propel an enhanced 
risk management, 
governance, accountability 
reporting and decision-
making. It would build 
the ability to identify 
and manage risks and 
opportunities related to 
environmental and social 
impact as well as build 
trust and transparency 
amongst investors and 
stakeholders.
As part of developing a 
sustainable financing policy 
and for implementing ESG 
benchmarks in lending and 
also for addressing issues in 
Environmental risk management 
and governance, the Bank has 
formulated ESMS policy (for 
governing Lending standards) 
and ESG Policy (for addressing 
other ESG issues). The Board 
has constituted an Executive 
Level Committee for ESG 
implementing in the Bank.
Executive Level Committee will 
be responsible for supervision 
and implementation of ESG 
activities in the Bank.
Positive: Leadership 
oversight on the ESG 
strategy, action plan, 
and performance 
fosters a positive 
impact on the 
environment and 
community. It also 
enables the Bank 
to further embed 
robust monitoring 
mechanisms across 
ESG initiatives and 
business practices. 
As we move into 
the future, ESG will 
be the cornerstone 
of our financial 
success, competitive 
advantage and future 
accomplishments.

Management System (ESMS) policy to govern 
the lending standards, alongside a Green Deposit 
Policy and Green Financing Framework to promote

sustainable development.

2a.	Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)
	
The Bank being part of the service industry, consumption of resources is limited. The Bank puts efforts to 
ensure it that purchases sustainable products from local suppliers and at a fair price. Some of the key initiatives 
the Bank has taken in this direction are as follows:
• 	 The Bank considers energy efficiency standards while purchasing equipment. The star rated equipment 
such as air-conditioners, laptops, computers, lighting devices are considered as part of assessment criteria 
in all branches and offices.
  b.	If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?
	
As an institution providing financial services, the Bank’s operations are not material resource intensive. However, 
as a responsible corporate citizen, the Bank has been focusing on maximising its resource consumption 
efficiency, reducing waste generation while focusing on improving its process efficiency and productivity. Even 
as digitization of products and services has been reducing the requirement of paper, it remains a significant 
resource consumed during the Bank’s normal course of business, and it has focused on reducing its paper 
consumption further by scaling up recycling, procuring paper from more sustainable sources, and rationalizing 
printing requirements internally within the business. For procurement of equipment that are required to run 
our banking operations, such as computer hardware, lighting devices, air conditioners and DG sets, the Bank 
considers green procurement and ensures that energy efficiency standards are duly considered during the 
purchase of such equipment.

comprehensive protection for the complainant against any adverse consequences. In compliance with the 
Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition, and Redressal) Act, 2013, the Bank has 
established an internal committee headed by Presiding Officer from a Senior level executive of the Bank. All 
officers and employees are encouraged to reach out to the Presiding Officer of the Internal Committee in case 
of any complaint. The Committee promptly and discreetly investigates instances and/or complaints of sexual 
harassment and acts in accordance with the prescribed guidelines of the act.
	
Similarly, the Bank’s Public Disclosure System (PDS) or Whistle-blower policy condemns any form of harassment, 
discrimination, victimization or unfair practices directed towards whistle-blowers. Measures are in place to 
minimize the difficulties whistle-blowers may face as a result of disclosing information. The identity of the 
whistle-blower is kept confidential to the extent permitted under law. Additionally, any other employee assisting 
in the investigation process receives the same level of protection as the whistle-blower.
