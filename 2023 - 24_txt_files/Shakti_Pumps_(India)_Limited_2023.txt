Statutory Report
Overview 
24. 	 Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues 
	
Indicate material responsible business conduct and sustainability issues pertaining to environmental and social matters that 
present a risk or an opportunity to your business, the rationale for identifying the same, approach to adapt or mitigate the 
risk along with its financial implications, as per the following format:-
SL 
No
Material Issue 
Identified
Risk / 
Opportunity
Rational for identifying 
risk or opportunity
In case of risk 
approach to adapt or 
mitigate
Financial implication 
of risk or opportunity
1.
Environmental 
Impact
Risk
Shakti Pumps’ products 
rely on energy-intensive 
manufacturing processes. 
Regulatory changes 
favouring sustainable 
practices could lead to 
increased compliance 
costs and reduced market 
access.
Implement 
energy-efficient 
manufacturing 
technologies and 
processes. Invest 
in renewable 
energy sources for 
operations.
Initial investment 
in eco-friendly 
technologies might 
be high, but long-
term operational cost 
savings and improved 
market reputation 
can offset this.
2.
Water Scarcity
Risk
Water is a key resource 
for pump manufacturing 
and agriculture. 
Water scarcity due to 
climate change could 
disrupt production and 
agricultural activities, 
affecting demand for 
products
Enhance water 
management 
practices within 
manufacturing 
facilities. Promote 
water-efficient 
farming techniques 
among customers.
Increased investment 
in water-saving 
technologies 
might be needed. 
Reduced demand 
from agricultural 
customers could 
impact revenue.
3.
Social 
Responsibility
Opportunity
Farmers are a significant 
customer group. 
Supporting them with 
training on sustainable 
farming practices can 
lead to improved product 
adoption and loyalty
Develop educational 
programs and 
resources for 
farmers. Collaborate 
with agricultural 
institutions for 
training initiatives.
Initial investment 
in educational 
programs. However, 
improved product 
adoption and 
customer loyalty 
can drive long-term 
revenue growth.
4.
Renewable Energy 
Adoption
Opportunity
Shakti Pumps specializes 
in solar water pumps. 
Increasing awareness and 
adoption of renewable 
energy sources provide a 
growing market for solar 
pumps.
Expand marketing 
efforts to highlight 
the benefits of solar 
pumps. Collaborate 
with government 
initiatives promoting 
renewable energy
Potential for 
increased sales and 
market share in the 
growing renewable 
energy Sector.
5.
Supply Chain 
Sustainability
Risk
Raw materials are crucial 
for manufacturing. 
Disruptions due to poor 
supplier practices or lack 
of sustainability measures 
could impact production 
and reputation.
Implement supplier 
screening and 
engagement for 
sustainability 
standards. Diversify 
supplier base to 
reduce dependency.
Investment in 
supplier management 
systems and potential 
cost of transitioning 
to new suppliers. 
Reduced supply 
chain disruptions and 
improved reputation 
over time.
