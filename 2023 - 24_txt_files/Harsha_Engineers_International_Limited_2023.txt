Employee 
Advancement 
& Development
Risk & 
Opportunity
The Company’s operations are mainly driven by 
its employees. It is crucial to ensure employees’ 
wellbeing to further enable the Company’s growth. 
The Company aims to provide ample opportunities 
to retain talent and ensure their growth.
To mitigate the risk of losing top talent, it is 
important to continuously analyses the best HR 
practices in the industry and make necessary 
enhancements. 
This 
can 
be 
achieved 
by 
implementing performance incentives on a timely 
basis and evaluating performance at every stage 
of the work process.
Negative
Compliance 
and Integrity
Risk
At the heart of the Company’s reputation and 
stakeholder confidence is its ability to ensure 
regulatory compliance. Regulations to report on 
ESG performance including climate related risks, 
targets and progress pose compliance risks to the 
organisation. Further, carbon tax may also materialise 
in medium term. It is crucial for the Company to 
maintain transparent and ethical business practices 
and manage and disclose its ESG performance, 
which in turn contribute to the Company’s continued 
success.
The Company can conduct regular reviews and 
monitor changes in the regulatory framework and 
accordingly ensure compliance. This will allow the 
Company to mitigate any compliance related risks.
Negative
Occupational 
Health and 
Safety
Risk
Due to factors such as machinery breakdown and 
human negligence, the labour-intensive nature of the 
industry puts workers at risk of accidents, as well as 
health and injury hazards.
The risk associated with the industry can be 
mitigated by developing and implementing critical 
safety standards across all project locations and 
identifying the training needs of employees at 
every level.

Opportunity
Effective product design allows the Company to 
create innovative and customer-centric solutions. 
By understanding market needs and trends, the 
Company can develop products that resonate 
with consumers, leading to increased demand and 
market relevance. Further, analyzing environmental 
impact of products throughout its life will help the 
organisation in taking steps to mitigate the negative 
impact which in turn will help in boosting customer 
demand as customers have also started considering 
life cycle impact of products.

Energy and 
Emissions 
Management
Risk & 
Opportunity
Implementing 
effective 
energy 
management 
strategies can lead to more efficient operations. By 
optimising energy usage, adopting energy-efficient 
technologies, and investing in renewable energy 
sources have cost saving potential. However, non- 
compliance with emissions standards, pollution 
limits, or energy efficiency requirements can result 
in fines, penalties, and damaged relationships with 
regulatory authorities.
To mitigate risks of emissions management, 
the Company is proactively investing in energy-
efficient technologies and renewable energy 
sources.
Positive
Water & 
Wastewater 
Management
Risk
Water scarcity is a growing global concern. As 
competition for water resources increases, the 
Company may struggle to secure a reliable and 
affordable water supply. Moreover, improper handling 
or discharge of wastewater can result in legal 
penalties, fines, and reputational damage.
The Company should adopt sustainable water 
management practices, invest in water-efficient 
technologies, monitor and control wastewater 
discharges. 
By 
managing 
water 
resources 
responsibly, the Company can reduce risks, 
enhance their reputation, and contribute to a more 
sustainable future.
Negative
Corporate 
Governance
Opportunity
Effective corporate governance ensures that ethical 
standards and values are upheld throughout 
the organisation. Strong and effective corporate 
governance can increase stakeholder confidence in 
the organisation which helps in creating value.
