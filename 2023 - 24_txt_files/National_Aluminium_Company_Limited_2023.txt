Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity.
	
The entity has identified the major stakeholder groups as Government, Shareholders, Customers, Employees, Communities, and Value Chain Partners 
(Suppliers, Contractors, Transporters). Our identification of Stakeholder groups considers the scope of engagement and is guided by attributes such as:
	
Dependency- Groups or individuals who are directly or indirectly dependent on our activities, products or services and associated performance or on 
whom we are dependent in order to operate
	
Responsibility- Groups or individuals to whom we have, or in future may have legal, commercial, operational or ethical/moral responsibilities.
	
Attention- Groups or individuals who need immediate attention from us with regard to financial, wider economic, social or environmental issues.

Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues.
	
The grievance procedure for executives and non-executives can be found in the intranet of the HR manual under the CDA rules caption. Additionally, 
there is a policy in place across all units, including the corporate office, regarding the prevention, prohibition, and redressal of sexual harassment of 
women at the workplace, in compliance with the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition & Redressal) Act, 2013. Internal 
Complaints Committees have been established at the production units and corporate office to address complaints related to sexual harassment.
	
However, for non-permanent workers, specifically contractors’ workers, there is no specifically defined grievance handling procedure. In such cases, 
grievances are typically received and addressed by the EIC (Contract Engineer-in-charge) or the Plant HRD (Human Resources Department) by 
intervening with the immediate employer, which is the contractor.

Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its coverage and implementation. 
	
Yes
	
At the NALCO Smelter Plant, several wastewater conservation measures have been implemented to achieve Zero Liquid Discharge:
●	
Surface Runoffs Collection: Surface runoffs from Pot-line and Carbon areas, along with wastewater from the shop floor, are collected in three 
holding pools with capacities of 100,000 m³, 51,000 m³, and 38,000 m³. This water is then treated in Ion-Exchange and Emrion Nano De-
fluoridation (DF) plants.
●	
Recycling Facilities: The treated water from Ion-Exchange and Emrion Nano DF plants, surface runoffs from various areas (e.g., Zero Discharge 
Sump, SPL Storage Area, Captive Landfill Area), subsoil water from Potlines, effluent water from the Hazardous Waste Incinerator, and Plant STP 
water are all recycled.
	
At the Captive Power Plant, there is zero discharge of wastewater. Decanted water from the Ash Pond is chemically treated and recycled for ash slurry 
making.
	
At the Alumina Refinery, wastewater is recycled from the Red Mud Pond, holding pond, Ash Pond, and STP treated water for use in various processes, 
including the Bayer process and horticulture.
	
At the Bauxite Mines, treated wastewater is 100% reused, achieving zero discharge after treatment in the canteen biological wastewater treatment 
facility and vehicle wash water treatment facility. The treated water is used for dust suppression.
	
At the Utkal D Coal Mines, Zero Liquid Discharge is maintained year-round, except during the monsoon season. During monsoon, excess treated 
water is discharged into a nearby nallah as per the conditions stipulated by the Consent to Operate issued by OSPCB Odisha, with prior intimation to 
the OSPCB.
