Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets 
and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
The Company firmly believes that integrating Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles into our business 
operations is paramount. This integration not only helps in proactively mitigating risks but also meets consumer expectations, 
ensures regulatory compliance, and enhances our reputation with our customers and our employees.  Ultimately, it leads 
to fostering a more sustainable and responsible future for the industry as a whole.
The Company recognises the significant environmental challenges faced by the industry and advocate for a shift from 
short-term, trend-based decisions to long-term, impactful solutions based on science and data. As a global platform 
company deeply committed to sustainability, the Company is aware and mindful of the environmental and social impacts 
of our operations. Hence, the Company is dedicated to finding innovative solutions to address these challenges head-on.
The Company ambition is to spearhead lasting change within the fashion industry, positioning ourselves as the premier 
supply-chain partner known for the ethical, sustainable, and eco-efficient strategies. Central to our Sustainability Agenda 
are four key pillars: Reduced Emissions, Respect for Water, Circular Thinking, and Community Building. The Company has 
outlined a roadmap with measurable targets spanning from 2023 to 2030, with the ultimate aim of achieving a Net Zero 
organisation by 2050.
Furthermore, our manufacturing facilities boast Gold LEED certification, with an ambition to attain Platinum Certification 
in the near future. Initiatives such as the installation of solar power at Good Earth Apparels Limited in Bangladesh and the 
establishment of a state-of-the-art wash plant at Progress Apparels (Bangladesh) Limited, funded by the Netherlands-
based Good Fashion Fund, underscore the commitment to sustainable practices. These endeavours not only enhance 
operational efficiencies but also align with the our commitment and focus on to environmental and social stewardship.
Moreover, through its investment arm, PDS Ventures, the Company has strategically backed pioneering companies such as 
Upcycle Labs, Evernu, Loop, and Style Theory. Upcycle Labs specialises in transforming unwanted inventory into exquisite 
decor products and store fittings through innovative upcycling techniques. Evernu leverages cutting-edge technology 
to recycle cotton garment waste into premium, renewable textiles. Meanwhile, Loop and Style Theory operate as online 
platforms facilitating the resale, swap, donation, and rental of clothing items, thereby fostering a more sustainable approach 
to fashion consumption.
The Company understand that the journey towards ESG excellence is ongoing. Therefore, it remains steadfast in the 
commitment to continuous improvement. The Company will continue to identify and address emerging ESG challenges, 
set ambitious targets, and drive positive change within the organisation and beyond.

step 
involves 
identifying workplace hazards through methods 
such as workplace inspections, job hazard analysis, 
and review of incident reports.
	
	
Risk Assessment: After identifying hazards, the next 
step is to assess the risks associated with each hazard 
by evaluating the likelihood and severity of potential 
harm or injury.
	
	
Controls: Following risk assessment, the Company 
develops and implements controls to eliminate or 
minimise the risks. This includes reviewing existing 
controls for efficiency and devising new controls 
such as engineering controls, administrative controls, 
or the use of personal protective equipment (PPE).

review of hazard controls are conducted to ensure 
their effectiveness and to identify any new hazards.

audits, or incident investigations.

Reporting to Designated Person: Each of The

officer, supervisor, or manager assigned to identify 
and resolve potential hazards. Workers can report 
hazards directly to these designated individuals.
	
	
Reporting to HR or Production Team: Workers also 
have the option to report hazards to the human 
resources department or the production team, 
who then coordinate with the designated person to 
address the hazard.
	
	
Whistleblowing Hotline: The Company has an 
Ethics Global Hotline Platform - https://pdsltd.com/
ethics-hotline/ where anonymous complaints can 
be lodged. Additionally, some partner factories have 
an industry hotline number for workers to report 
hazards.
	
	
Grievance Box: Workers can submit a grievance to 
their employer if they believe a work-related hazard 
has not been properly addressed. This can be done 
by submitting a written grievance or utilising a 
grievance box for submitting the same.

Provide details of instances of engagement with, and

Vulnerable and marginalised stakeholder groups are those 
who, due to circumstances beyond their control, lack the 
same opportunities as the privileged segments of society. PDS 
has identified these groups and implemented various initiatives 
to address their needs, particularly focusing on underprivileged 
children and women in less developed regions.
	
One such initiative is "Soham For Kids Education Society" in 
Mallapur, Hyderabad, where PDS promotes the education 
of underprivileged and orphaned children. This program 
provides access to quality education, nutritious meals, 
educational materials, and health check-ups. Currently, 
the school has over 200 students enrolled from nearby 
villages. Additionally, The Company provides skills training 
to the parents of these children.
	
The Company also supports "Soham For All" at the Centre of 
HOPE Foundation in Dhaka, Bangladesh, which includes a 
primary school for children and a vocational training center 
for garment factory workers. Since 2015, the school has 
been educating children in the Bengali medium with a focus 
on English language skills. The curriculum also emphasises 
other skills and "intelligences" through enrichment programs 
in art, craft, and self-expression. Higher-grade students 
receive training in computer skills and industrial sewing.
	
Furthermore, the Company’s subsidiary, Poeticgem 
International Limited (Poeticgem) has undertaken projects 
in Bangladesh which support underprivileged children 
and young girls. Poeticgem collaborates closely with the 
Abinta Kabir Foundation to provides a holistic education 
with a specially designed curriculum and fulfill all the 
school’s needs. They also provide scholarship to the 
children of workers, during the year they contributed 
~$14,500 towards these scholarships. Poeticgem also led 
a program to create thermal jackets for neonates suffering 
from hypothermia in low-income settings. These jackets 
were designed to act as an incubator and regulate the 
body temperature of the infants in places that lacked 
access to incubators. 45 Jackets were designed and 
produced by Poeticgem for use in Bangladesh.

4. Boundary of the report covers the Group entities as on 31 March  2024, covering its 127 subsidiaries, 
5 joint ventures and 5 associates located in India and overseas. 
 
5. Our assurance engagement is with respect to the financial year ended 31 March 2024 information 
only unless otherwise stated and we have not performed any procedures with respect to earlier 
periods or any other elements included in the BRSR and therefore, do not express any 
opinion/conclusion thereon. 
Criteria 
6. The criteria used by the Company to prepare the Identified Sustainability Information for the financial 
year ended 31 March 2024 is summarised below (‘BRSR Framework'): 
• Regulation 34(2)(f) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (the “SEBI”) (Listing Obligations 
and Disclosure Requirements), Regulations, 2015, as amended; 
• Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting Requirements for listed entities as per Master 
Circular No. SEBI/HO/CFD/PoD2/ CIR/P/2023/120 dated 11 July 2023; and 
• SEBI Circular SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD-SEC-2/P/CIR/2023/122 dated 12 July 2023 and clarifications 
thereto issued by SEBI. 
Management’s Responsibilities 
7. The Company’s management is responsible for selecting or establishing suitable criteria for preparing 
the Identified Sustainability  Information, taking into account applicable laws and regulations, if any, 
related to reporting on the Identified Sustainability  Information, identification of key aspects, 
engagement with stakeholders, content, preparation and presentation of the Information in accordance 
with the Criteria. This responsibility includes design, implementation and maintenance of internal control 
relevant to the preparation of the BRSR and the measurement of Identified Sustainability Information, 
which is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
Inherent limitations 
8. The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure 
non-financial information allows for different, but acceptable, measures and measurement techniques 
and can affect comparability between entities.  
Auditor’s Independence and Quality Control 
9. We are independent of the Company and have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance 
with the requirements of the International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued by the 
International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ (‘IESBA’) and have the required competencies 
and experience to conduct this assurance engagement. 
10. Our firm applies International Standard on Quality Management (ISQM) 1, “Quality Management for 
Firms that Perform Audits or Reviews of Financial Statements, or Other Assurance or Related Services 
Engagements” and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including 
documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional 
standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. 
Auditor’s Responsibility  
11. Our responsibility is to express a reasonable assurance in the form of an opinion on BRSR Core 
Information and express a limited assurance in the form of a conclusion on other selected indicators of 
BRSR other than BRSR Core Information, based on the procedures we have performed and evidence 
we have obtained. We conducted our assurance engagement in accordance with the International 
Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised), “Assurance Engagements other than 
Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information” (‘ISAE 3000 (Revised)’) issued by the 
International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (‘IAASB’). This standard requires that we plan 
and perform our engagement to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the BRSR Core 
Annual Report 2023-24
STATUTORY REPORTS

163
 
 
 
 
Information is prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria and limited assurance 
about whether the other selected indicators of BRSR other than BRSR Core Information is free from 
material misstatement. 
 
12. A reasonable assurance engagement involves assessing the suitability in the circumstances of the 
Company’s use of the Criteria as the basis for the preparation of the BRSR Core Information, assessing 
the risks of material misstatement of the BRSR Core Information whether due to fraud or error, 
responding to the assessed risks as necessary in the circumstances and evaluating the overall 
presentation of the BRSR Core Information.  
 
13. A limited assurance engagement involves assessing the suitability in the circumstances of the 
Company’s use of the Criteria as the basis for the preparation of the other selected indicators of BRSR 
other than BRSR Core Information, identifying areas where material misstatement is likely to arise in 
the other selected indicators of BRSR other than BRSR Core Information whether due to fraud or error, 
designing and performing procedures to address identified risk areas as necessary in the circumstances 
and evaluating the overall presentation of the other selected indicators of BRSR other than Core 
Information.  
 
14. A limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance 
engagement in relation to both the risk assessment procedures, including an understanding of internal 
control, and the procedures performed in response to the assessed risks. 
 
15. The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment and included inquiries, 
observation of processes performed, inspection of documents, evaluating the appropriateness of 
quantification methods and reporting policies, analytical procedures and agreeing or reconciling with 
underlying records. 
16. Given the circumstances of the engagement, in performing the procedures listed above, we: 
• 
Conducted virtual site visits at the manufacturing facilities of Progress Apparels (Bangladesh) 
Limited and Norlanka Progress (Private) Limited, for data and document verification.  
 
• 
Carried out discussions at the corporate office and manufacturing facilities for data and document 
verification;  
• 
Interviewed senior executives to understand the reporting process, governance, systems and 
controls in place during the reporting period.   
• 
Reviewed the records and relevant documentation including information from audited financial 
statements or statutory reports submitted by the Company to support relevant performance 
disclosures within our scope. 
• 
Evaluated the suitability and application of Criteria and that the Criteria have been applied 
appropriately to the Identified Sustainability Information. 
• 
Selected key parameters and representative sampling, based on statistical audit sampling tables 
and agreeing claims to source information to check accuracy and completeness of claims such as 
source data, meter data, etc. 
• 
Re-performed calculations to check accuracy of claims,  
• 
Reviewed data from independent sources, wherever available,  
• 
Reviewed data, information about sustainability performance indicators and statements in the 
report. 
• 
Reviewed and verified information/ data as per the BRSR framework; 
PDS Limited
Global Fashion Infrastructure Company

• 
Reviewed accuracy, transparency and completeness of the information/ data provided; 
 
17.  The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are 
less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance 
obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have 
been obtained had we performed a reasonable assurance engagement. Accordingly, we do not express 
a reasonable assurance opinion about whether the other selected indicators of BRSR other than BRSR 
Core Information have been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria. 
Exclusions: 
18. Our assurance engagement scope excludes the following and therefore we do not express an opinion 
on the same:  
• 
Any disclosure other than those mentioned in the Identified Sustainability Information section above 
• 
Data and information outside the defined reporting period 
• 
Data related to Company’s financial performance, strategy and other related linkages expressed in 
the Report. 
• 
The Company’s statements that describe expression of opinion, belief, aspiration, expectation, 
forward looking statements provided by the Company and assertions related to Intellectual Property 
Rights and other competitive issues. 
• 
Mapping of the Report with reporting frameworks other than those mentioned in Criteria above. 
 
While we considered the effectiveness of management’s internal controls when determining the nature 
and extent of our procedures, our assurance engagement was not designed to provide assurance on 
internal controls. 
 
The procedures did not include testing controls or performing procedures relating to checking 
aggregation or calculation of data within IT systems. 
 
Opinion 
19. Based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, the BRSR Core 
Information included in the BRSR for the year ended 31 March 2024 is prepared in all material respects, 
in accordance with the Criteria.  
Conclusion 
 
20. Based on the procedures we have performed and the evidences we have obtained, nothing has come 
to our attention that causes us to believe that other selected indicators of BRSR other than BRSR Core
