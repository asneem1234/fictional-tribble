This engagement was conducted by a multidisciplinary team including assurance practitioners, engineers and 
environmental and social professionals. 
In our opinion, the company’s Identified Sustainability Information on pages 281 to 329 of the Annual Report for 
the period 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024, subject to reasonable assurance is prepared, in all material respects, in 
accordance with the Regulation 34(2)(f) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) Listing Obligations and 
Disclosure Requirements (SEBI LODR) and basis of preparation set out in the Section A, Business Responsibility and 
Sustainability Reporting of the Annual Report.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 
(Revised), Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information issued by the 
International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB). Our responsibilities under those standards are further 
described in the “Our responsibilities” section of our report.
	
 
Independent Practitioners’ 
Reasonable Assurance Report
[1] Notified by SEBI vide circular number SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD-SEC-2/P/CIR/2023/122 dated 12 July 2023
271
We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the International Code of Ethics for 
Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) issued by the International Ethics Standards 
Board for Accountants (IESBA).
Our firm applies International Standard on Quality Management (ISQM) 1, Quality Management for Firms that Perform 
Audits or Reviews of Financial Statements, or Other Assurance or Related Services Engagements, issued by the 
IAASB. This standard requires the firm to design, implement and operate a system of quality management, including 
policies or procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and 
regulatory requirements.
We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Other information
Management and the Board of Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises 
the information included in the Company’s Annual Report (but does not include the BRSR Core attributes and 
assurance report thereon).
Additionally, we have performed a limited assurance engagement on select BRSR and GRI indicators and issued an 
independent assurance report on 16 July 2024.
Our report thereon is included with the other information.
Our reasonable assurance opinion on the ISI does not extend to other information that accompanies or contains the 
‘ISI and our assurance report’ (hereafter referred to as “other information”). We have read the other information, but 
we have not performed any procedures with respect to the other information.
Other matter
Select BRSR Core attributes of the Company for the year ended 31 March 2023 were assured by the previous 
assurance practitioner who had expressed an unmodified opinion on 17 May 2023.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.
Intended use or purpose
The ISI and our reasonable assurance report are intended for users who have reasonable knowledge of the BRSR Core 
attributes, the reporting criteria and ISI and who have read the information in the ISI with reasonable diligence and 
understand that the ISI is prepared and assured at appropriate levels of materiality.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.
Responsibilities for the identified Sustainability Information (ISI)
The management of the Company acknowledge and understand their responsibility for:
•	
designing, implementing and maintaining internal controls relevant to the preparation of the ISI that is free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error;
•	
selecting or establishing suitable criteria for preparing the ISI, taking into account applicable laws and 
regulations, if any, related to reporting on the ISI, identification of key aspects, engagement with stakeholders, 
content, preparation and presentation of the ISI in accordance with the reporting criteria;
272
•	
disclosure of the applicable criteria used for preparation of the ISI in the relevant report/statement; 
•	
preparing/properly calculating the ISI in accordance with the reporting criteria; and 
•	
ensuring the reporting criteria is available for the intended users with relevant explanation;
•	
establishing targets, goals and other performance measures, and implementing actions to achieve such targets, 
goals and performance measures;
•	
responsible for providing the details of the management personnel who takes ownership of the ISI disclosed in 
the report;
•	
ensuring compliance with law, regulation or applicable contracts;
•	
making judgments and estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances; 
•	
identifying and describing any inherent limitations in the measurement or evaluation of information subject to 
assurance in accordance with the reporting criteria; 
•	
preventing and detecting fraud;
•	
selecting the content of the ISI, including identifying and engaging with intended users to understand their 
information needs;
•	
informing us of other information that will be included with the ISI;
•	
supervision of other staff involved in the preparation of the ISI
Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the reporting process for the Company’s ISI.
Inherent limitations in preparing the ISI
The preparation of the company’s BRSR information requires the management to establish or interpret the criteria, 
make determinations about the relevancy of information to be included, and make estimates and assumptions that 
affect the reported information.
Measurement of certain amounts and BRSR Core metrics, some of which are estimates, is subject to substantial 
inherent measurement uncertainty, for example, GHG emissions, water footprint, energy footprint. Obtaining sufficient 
appropriate evidence to support our opinion/conclusion does not reduce the uncertainty in the amounts and metrics. 
Our responsibilities
We are responsible for:
•	
Planning and performing the engagement to obtain reasonable assurance on the sustainability disclosures in the 
BRSR Core are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, in accordance with the Reporting 
Criteria in line with the section above. 
•	
Forming an independent opinion, based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have 
obtained, and
•	
Reporting our reasonable assurance opinion to the Directors of Godrej Consumer Products Limited. 
Exclusions
Our assurance scope excludes the following and therefore we will not express a conclusion on the same:
•	
Operations of the Company other than those mentioned in the “Scope of Assurance”.
•	
Aspects of the BRSR and the data/information (qualitative or quantitative) other than the ISI.
273
•	
Data and information outside the defined reporting period i.e., 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024. 
•	
The statements that describe expression of opinion, belief, aspiration, expectation, aim, or future intentions 
provided by the Company.
Summary of the work we performed as the basis for our conclusion
We exercised professional judgement and maintained professional skepticism throughout the engagement. We 
designed and performed our procedures to obtain evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
reasonable assurance opinion. 
The nature, timing, and extent of the procedures selected depended on our judgment, including an assessment of 
the risks of material misstatement of the information subject to reasonable assurance, whether due to fraud or error. 
We identified and assessed the risks of material misstatement through understanding the information subject to 
reasonable assurance and the engagement circumstances. We also obtained an understanding of the internal control 
relevant to the information subject to reasonable assurance in order to design procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal controls. 
In carrying out our engagement, we:
•	
assessed the suitability of the criteria used by the company in preparing the reasonable assurance information;
•	
evaluated the appropriateness of reporting policies, quantification methods and models used in the preparation 
of the information subject to reasonable assurance and the reasonableness of estimates made by the company; 
and 
•	
evaluated the overall presentation of the information subject to reasonable assurance.

This engagement was conducted by a multidisciplinary team including assurance practitioners, engineers and

Based on the procedures performed and evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention to cause us to believe 
that the company’s Identified Sustainability Information on pages 92 to 329 of the Annual Report relating to select 
GRI indicators on a consolidated basis of reporting and select BRSR attributes (which are not part of BRSR Core) 
on a standalone basis of reporting for the period 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024, subject to limited assurance is not 
prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the the World Resource Institute (WRI) / World Business Council 
for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol (A Corporate Accounting and Reporting  
Standards), and the Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting & Reporting Standard , Regulation 34(2)(f) of the

Basis for conclusion
We conducted our engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 
(Revised), Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information, and ISAE 
3410, Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance 
Standards Board (IAASB). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the “Our responsibilities” 
section of our report.
We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the International Code of Ethics for 
Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) issued by the International Ethics Standards 
Board for Accountants (IESBA).
Our firm applies International Standard on Quality Management (ISQM) 1, Quality Management for Firms that Perform 
Audits or Reviews of Financial Statements, or Other Assurance or Related Services Engagements, issued by the 
IAASB. This standard requires the firm to design, implement and operate a system of quality management, including 
policies or procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and 
regulatory requirements. 
We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion.
Other information
Management and the Board of Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises 
the information included in the Company’s Annual Report (but does not include the select BRSR and GRI attributes and 
assurance report thereon).
Additionally, we have performed a reasonable assurance engagement on SEBI BRSR Core attributes and issued an 
independent assurance report on 16 July 2024.
Our report thereon is included with the other information.
Our limited assurance opinion on the ISI does not extend to other information that accompanies or contains the ‘ISI 
and our assurance report’ (hereafter referred to as “other information”). We have read the other information, but we 
have not performed any procedures with respect to the other information.
Other matter
Select BRSR and GRI attributes of the Company for the year ended 31 March 2023 were assured by the previous 
assurance practitioner who had expressed an unmodified opinion on 17 May 2023.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.
Intended use or purpose
The ISI and our limited assurance report are intended for users who have reasonable knowledge of the BRSR attributes 
and GRI attributes, the reporting criteria and ISI and who have read the information in the ISI with reasonable diligence 
and understand that the ISI is prepared and assured at appropriate levels of materiality.

Responsibilities for Identified Sustainability Information (ISI)
The management of the company are responsible for:
•	
designing, implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation of the Identified 
Sustainability Information that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error;
•	
selecting or developing suitable criteria for preparing the Identified Sustainability Information and appropriately 
referring to or describing the criteria; and
•	
preparing the Identified Sustainability Information in accordance with the reporting criteria.
Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the reporting process for the company’s ISI.
Exclusions:
Our assurance scope excludes the following and therefore we will not express a conclusion on the same:
•	
Operations of the Company other than those mentioned in the “Scope of Assurance”.
•	
Aspects of the BRSR and GRI attributes and the data/information (qualitative or quantitative) other than the ISI.
•	
Data and information outside the defined reporting period i.e., 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024.
•	
The statements that describe expression of opinion, belief, aspiration, expectation, aim, or future intentions 
provided by the Company.
Inherent limitations
The preparation of the company’s sustainability information requires the management to establish or interpret the 
criteria, make determinations about the relevancy of information to be included, and make estimates and assumptions 
that affect the reported information.
Measurement of certain amounts and BRSR and GRI attributes, some of which are estimates, is subject to substantial 
inherent measurement uncertainty, for example GHG emissions, water footprint, energy footprint. Obtaining sufficient 
appropriate evidence to support our opinion/conclusion does not reduce the uncertainty in the amounts and metrics.
Our responsibilities
We are responsible for:
•	
planning and performing the engagement to obtain a limited assurance about whether the ISI is free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error;
•	
forming an independent conclusion, based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have 
obtained; and
•	
reporting our conclusion to the Directors of GCPL.
Summary of the work we performed as the basis for our conclusion
We exercised professional judgement and maintained professional skepticism throughout the engagement. We 
designed and performed our procedures to obtain evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
limited assurance conclusion. 
278
Our procedures selected depended on our understanding of the information subject to limited assurance and other 
engagement circumstances, and our consideration of areas where material misstatements are likely to arise. In carrying 
out our engagement, we:
•	
assessed the suitability of the criteria used by the company in preparing the information subject to limited 
assurance; 
•	
interviewed senior management and relevant staff at corporate and selected locations concerning policies for 
occupational health and safety, and the implementation of these across the business;
•	
through inquiries, obtained an understanding of Godrej Consumer Products Limited’s control environment, 
processes and information systems relevant to the preparation of the information subject to limited assurance, 
but did not evaluate the design of particular control activities, obtain evidence about their implementation or test 
their operating effectiveness;
•	
made inquiries of relevant staff at corporate and selected locations responsible for the preparation of the 
Information subject to limited assurance;
•	
undertook all site visits out of which 6 were physical site visits and 5 were virtual site visits; we selected these 
sites based on the relative size of the production compared to total capacity, workforce of these locations to the 
total workforce, unexpected fluctuations in the information subject to limited assurance since the prior period, 
and sites not visited in the prior period;
•	
inspected, at each site visited, a limited number of items to or from supporting records, as appropriate;
•	
applied analytical procedures, as appropriate; 
•	
recalculated the information subject to limited assurance based on the criteria; and
•	
evaluated the overall presentation of the information subject to limited assurance to determine whether it 
is consistent with the criteria and in line with our overall knowledge of, and experience with, the company’s 
occupational health and safety.
The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent 
than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance 
engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance 
engagement been performed.

current year and previous year. The effects and reasons relating to restatements of the 
comparative year have been explained as footnotes in relevant indicators.
Standalone basis
There are certain restatements in this 
report due to change in methodology 
or re-computation of certain attributes 
for FY 2022-23. The effects and 
reasons have been included under the

Please indicate material responsible business conduct and sustainability issues pertaining to environmental and 
social matters that present a risk or an opportunity to your business, rationale for identifying the same, approach 
to adapt or mitigate the risk along-with its financial implications, as per the following format

Financial implications of 
the risk or opportunity 
(Indicate positive or negative 
implications)
1
Occupational 
health & safety
Risk
Physical risk to the workforce 
in manufacturing operations 
and frontline distribution 
teams. Lack of appropriate and 
sufficient training to workers and 
employees on best-practices 
related to OHS, might face 
health and safety risks such as 
frequent accidents at workplaces 
or manufacturing plants. Indirect 
risks posed due to this issue can 
be workplace closures, increase 
in legal and compliance costs, 
intense scrutiny by stakeholders, 
lower morale in the workforce, 
and adverse impact on brand 
reputation. 
We have a robust Health & Safety 
policy and strong SOPs to ensure 
highest adherence to health 
and safety, and a governance 
mechanism to ensure any 
incidents are duly investigated 
and resolved for the future. We 
ensure periodic review of safety 
procedures and the Central Safety 
Committee and committees at 
plants review monthly data for 
occupational health and safety. 
GCPL has a consistent record in 
zero fatalities across our offices 
and manufacturing plants leading 
to high-morale and trust amongst 
employees and workers.
Negative implication. Potential 
health and safety incidents 
and non-compliance hamper 
company reputation and have 
financial repercussions.

2
Product safety 
and Quality 
Testing 
Risk
The regulatory landscape is 
evolving and the guidelines 
pertaining to the composition 
of various products can change 
and evolve rapidly as GCPL's 
is present in multiple emerging 
economies.
GCPL has implemented quality 
testing standard operating 
procedures for all its products. 
GCPL has also incorporated a 
robust products and raw material 
quality testing procedure. This 
is supported by enhancing the 
capabilities of team through 
skill development trainings and 
ensuring safe and compliant 
operations. 
Negative implication. Failure to 
adapt to ever evolving regulatory 
landscape especially with 
respect to usage of chemical 
components, across multiple 
geographies, the Company 
may face litigation risks from 
consumers, and risk of increased 
cost of chemical safety and 
alternative chemicals.
3
Business Ethics 
and Ethical 
Marketing 
Risk
Business ethics are the 
moral principles that guide 
decision-making process for 
an organization. It includes 
policies, and values that 
govern the way companies and 
individuals engage in business 
activity. Ethical marketing 
and product labelling is a 
crucial factor in marketing as it 
highlights the products’ unique 
selling point, composition, and 
claims on sustainability. GCPL 
has to be cognizant about 
marketing practices and make 
efforts to ensure claims which are 
ethically and factually correct.
GCPL has adopted multiple policies 
for example: code of conduct, 
whistle blower policy, anti-sexual 
harassment policy, human rights 
policy, and health and safety 
policy, to name a few. GCPL has 
developed and rolled out a human 
rights due diligence based on 
the UN Guiding principles and 
have assessed most of our owned 
operations. GCPL's supply chain 
policy also focuses on responsible 
conduct with all the stakeholders 
and adherence to human rights 
principles.
Negative implication. Any 
lapse in compliance of code of 
conduct may pose a governance 
risk. Moreover, if GCPL fails to 
communicate responsibly to 
the consumers and is engaged 
in false claims about its 
product and the sustainability 
performance, it is a reputational 
risk to the Company.
4
Governance and 
accountability 
Risk 
It means adhering to all 
reporting and transparency 
requirements by market 
regulators and further voluntarily 
discloses information on other 
international frameworks on ESG 
GCPL adheres to BRSR in India and 
other international frameworks 
like CDP, GRI and Integrated 
Reporting <IR> frameworks. 
GCPL is consistently transparent 
in reporting leading to further 
investor and other stakeholder 
confidence. 
Negative implication. 
Any lapse in reporting on 
material information may 
lead to regulatory and legal 
risks and decline in investor 
confidence. This may increase 
financial liabilities due to 
legal obligations, impact on 
credit score, lower employee 
confidence, and impact on brand 
reputation.
5
Sustainable 
Packaging 
Risk and 
Opportunity
Enforcement of strict regulations 
on plastic, waste generation, 
and disposal arising from 
geographies such as India and 
Africa, may result in higher short-
term costs for compliance
As most of GCPL products involves 
plastic packaging, we focus on 
plastic packaging intensity. It is 
determined by the weight of the 
packaging to overall product 
weight. GCPL has reduced plastic 
packaging intensity by over 22% 
from the base year of 2019-20. This 
has resulted in cost savings and 
reduced its Extended Producer 
Responsibility (EPR) requirements. 
Positive implication. GCPL 
is proactively adapting best 
practices in sustainable 
packaging which reduces overall 
plastic intensity and helps reduce 
transportation costs due to 
reduced weights, and lower EPR 
requirements. GCPL has also 
taken targets and made progress 
on reducing overall packaging 
weight and waste generated 
from packaging. Additionally, 
we are exploring greener 
alternatives to plastic packaging.

6
Sustainable 
supply chain 
management 
Risk
GCPL is engaged in procurement 
of materials and services from 
diverse suppliers. Some of the 
key risks that can impact the 
company’s supply chain are 
ESG compliance risk for critical 
suppliers, and unethical sourcing 
practices. 
As a part of sustainable supply 
chain engagement, GCPL has 
collated qualitative and quantitative 
data, and evaluated close to 75% of 
suppliers by procurement spends 
for their ESG. To drive supplier 
engagement effectively, GCPL has 
also shared industry best practices 
and suggestive actions. 
Negative implication. ESG non-
compliance by critical suppliers 
is risky and will impact the 
Company’s cost of procurement, 
increased cost of compliance and 
adverse impact on company’s 
brand image.
7
Renewable 
Energy 
Opportunity
Adoption of renewable 
energy will lower GCPL's 
emissions, and save costs in 
the long-term.
Currently, GCPL is utilizing 
over 27% renewable energy 
in its operations. We also use 
briquette fired boilers and 
microturbines for steam, and 
invest in solar PV and apply 
for green tariffs wherever 
available. 
Positive implication. More 
renewable energy will help 
lower GCPL's emissions and 
even improve circularity of 
operations. 
8
Research & 
Development 
Opportunity
Strong R&D led initiatives 
with an ESG focus is a 
market opportunity and a 
brand differentiator. 
GCPL has completed Life 
Cycle Assessments for 
products constituting 60% of 
our revenue. Through this, we 
are able to identify the areas 
of sustainable improvement. 
By addressing these gaps, we 
are able to make sustainable 
innovations and even offer 
products at a green discount 
rather than a green premium 
as we to pass on the savings 
to customers. 
Positive implication. GCPL 
prioritises innovation in 
new technologies that offer 
consumers value for their 
money. R&D has played a 
pivotal role in developing 
new products in home care 
and personal care product 
portfolios. 
9
Sustainable 
and Greener 
Products
Opportunity
GCPL has a key goal to 
ensure that its products 
are green while ensuring 
they are affordable and 
accessible. 
GCPL has rolled out serveral 
green products, one example 
is the Godrej Magic Hand 
Wash. It uses lower water 
content compared to 
alternatives and has lower 
plastic packing impact thus 
further resulting in cost 
savings and offering the 
world's most affordable 
handwash. 
Positive implication. 
GCPL looks to expand 
its product portfolio 
to be more affordable, 
accessible, and sustainable. 
This will prepare GCPL to 
invest further in product 
innovation and roll out 
products that are superior 
to available alternatives.
10
Diversity & 
Inclusion 
Opportunity
Having an adequate 
diversity ratio and grooming 
women leaders is a key 
priority of GCPL 
For the senior leadership 
roles at GCPL, women 
currently represent 22%. 
GCPL aims to have 30% 
women in senior leadership 
by 2030. We are also 
constantly seeking best 
practices in hiring women in 
leadership positions, provide 
opportunities to Person with 
disabilities (PwD), and LGBTQ 
communities. 
Positive implication. GCPL 
aims to create an inclusive 
work environment where 
best-in-class talent aim to 
work. GCPL will invest in 
the overall development 
of its employees and 
providing training and skill 
development opportunities.

Does the Entity have Processes in place to avoid / manage Conflict of Interests involving Members of the Board 
of Directors? (Yes/No) and if yes, provide Details of the same:

Yes, we ensure that we’re compliant with the requirements stated in the Companies Act and SEBI Listing 
Regulations for ensuring that there is no conflict of interest. At the beginning of the year, we receive the 
disclosure from directors for the entities in which they are interested and the similar disclosures are also received 
at the time of appointment of directors. Whenever any business decisions are taken, the Board is informed about 
the interest of any particular director in that matter and such director will not be included in the discussion and 
decision pertaining to the matter wherein he/she is interested. We ensure that an Independent Director on the 
board of GCPL should not be a Non-Independent Director on the board of another company if there is a Non-
Independent Director on GCPL’s board who is also an Independent Director on the board of the same other 
company. This prevents a situation where two directors might influence each other’s decisions across different 
companies, and create conflict of interest.

Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy work place.
	
Our company vision is to bring about a strong Safety and Health culture and create an incident free organization. 
We are committed to provide a safe and healthy work environment for the well–being of all GCPL employees & 
stakeholders.
	
In order to achieve our aspirations, we have outlined a four pillar approach towards safety. These four pillars 
include:
	
1.	
People and Culture
	
2.	
Safety Infrastructure
	
3.	
OHS Management System
	
4.	
Automation, Technology and AI
	
We believe that people are the key to build a strong safety culture and as a company we should strive to connect 
each and every employee by using innovative ways like hands on trainings, skits and safety competitions. 
Company has focused on improving safety awareness among all employees and contractual workforce. We 
arrange over 300 safety training programs across plants and cover over 25,000 employees and contractual 
workforce every year. As per our commitment to close gaps on identified critical to safety areas, we have been 
investing in improving our safety infrastructure and systems. Some of key projects covered in last two years are 
around;
	
•	
Fall protection system
	
•	
Electrical system upgrades
	
•	
Machine Guarding & LOTO provisions
	
•	
Fire prevention & protection system upgrade
	
Automation and AI is the new way of working & we believe it can help us making our operation safer. As a 
company we are looking at all such opportunities. Last year we have used Drone for inspection of boiler stacks 
health. This has helped us in reducing the risk significantly.

PRINCIPLE 4: Businesses should respect the interests of and be responsive to 
all its stakeholders
Essential Indicators
1	
Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity. 
	
In consultation with our multiple business functions, we identified and formed a list of the most relevant 
stakeholders who are critical to our business. For us, at GCPL, stakeholders are those individuals or groups of 
individuals who can be impacted by and have an impact on our products, operations and activities. We prioritised 
the stakeholders based on the extent of their influence on our business functions and also their dependence on 
us. In our double materiality assessment, we selected a representative sample of each stakeholder group from 
each location. We then conducted engagements through various forums and discussion platforms. 
	
We organise periodic materiality study findings and share with the GCPL Board. In addition, we formulated a 
stakeholder engagement process that will enable us to consult them, keep them informed of the latest activities, 
engage with them regularly and collaborate with or empower them. Regulatory changes, inputs, requests from 
investors, evolving supplier scenario, feedback from CSR implementation partners and local communities are 
informed to the Board and their guidance is sought for way forward on these matters. 
	
Our Board Members are a part of the CSR and ESG committee and the Board is updated about the discussions 
in these meetings during the Board Meetings. Few of our Board and Senior Management travel to various 
geographies for market assessment and obtaining firsthand feedback from various stakeholders. Our CSR 
committee Board members visit our programmes on ground and communicate directly with our beneficiaries and 
NGO partners on ground. Additionally, we conduct Investor and Analyst calls multiple times a year wherein the 
investors get a chance to interact with the Board/ senior Management and satisfy their queries.

Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, and 
social topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on 
these topics were incorporated into policies and activities of the entity.
	
Yes. We carried out a formal stakeholder engagement process while carrying out double materiality assessment 
in 2024. Our stakeholders provided inputs and covered a number of ESG material concerns, which have been 
incorporated into our ESG focus areas. For example, sustainable packaging and greener products were one of 
the biggest priorities. These have become imperative to our focus and we are working to reduce our plastic 
packaging intensity, increase our recyclable plastic packaging and find ways to lower the overall environmental 
impact of our products. In 2020, our previous materiality assessment revealed occupational health and safety a 
top material topic. Since then we have launched a Safety and Health policy and have built a robust process to 
create a safe and healthy work environment for all GCPL stakeholders - GCPL employees, business associates, 
processors, contractors, sub-contractors, vendors, transporters, customers, and visitors.

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases.
	
We have set up a complaints committee for grievance redressal and we have this communicated through our 
policy roll-out to share points of contact. We have launched Conduct, a virtual platform for the reporting and 
redressal of complaints against sexual harassment to enable anonymous reporting and discussions. Our gender-
neutral policy enables our employees from all genders to avail the protection against sexual harassment at 
the workplace. Post resolution of POSH complaints, decisions such as change of teams, locations, working 
arrangements, termination of respondent etc. further prevent adverse consequences.

We have developed action plans for our 10 salient issues. These plans are customised for each region based 
on their assessment scores and they lay out our strategy to address and strengthen our response on every 
parameter. The plan defines the actions our teams need to take on ground. The plan takes into consideration the 
best-in-class standards and international laws of human rights.
Leadership Indicators
1	
Details of a business process being modified / introduced as a result of addressing human rights grievances/
complaints.
	
One thing we implemented is for each employee to acknowledge the Code of Conduct at the time of their 
joining, to ensure they up-hold the values of safety, respect and Human Rights at Godrej. The Code of Conduct 
also provides information on points of contact who will take any complaints in this respect forward. We have also 
started POSH sensitization workshops in partnership with experienced third party vendors and all employees 
have to mandatorily complete POSH eLearning module on the employee portal. The IC members have to 
undergo trainings every 6 months on how to deal with cases and provide support to the aggrieved parties. 
Complaints and cases are tracked and reviewed at the central level by leadership and HR teams at periodic basis.
2	
Details of the scope and coverage of any Human rights due-diligence conducted.
	
From fiscal year 2022-2024, we assessed 93% of our sites and covered employees, workers, contract workers 
and community members across 13 manufacturing plants. We also assessed suppliers covering 76% of our 
procurement spends for human rights impacts. The assessments covered our own employees, third-party and 
contract employees, women, children, migrant workers, and local communities.
3	
Is the premise/office of the entity accessible to differently abled visitors, as per the requirements of the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016?
	
Our Godrej One (Global headquarters) is accessible for differently abled visitors and workers with infrastructural 
modifications being updated on an on-going basis. Modifications are in progress for regional and manufacturing 
units. Third party contractors are employed to conduct independent audits of our infrastructure in our 
manufacturing units so that we improve our facilities at a regular basis.

Yes, we have set up a ZLD process at each of our plant locations. 
	
In the North, the Common effluent treatment plant (CETP) at the Baddi site act as a central processing unit, 
where other plants transfer all the effluents after primary treatment, whereas at the Jammu location, we recycle 
treated water and use for domestic purpose like plantaion and flushing in our plant, along with ETP/STP.
	
There are no waste water generated in our processes at south cluster; instead, only lab wash waters is 
discharged. At South cluster, we ensure ZLD in all our units by utilising STP to treat household waste water. No 
water is discharged out of any of our plant locations as the treated water is used for domestic purposes.
