forefront 
of 
financial 
inclusion 
in 
the 
Country, 
lending 
to

segments 
such as small businesses 
and 
rural

NBFCs 
have 
played 
an 
important role in deepening 
access to formal credit and 
promoting inclusive growth. 
NBFCs have reached out 
to rural, semi-urban and 
metro areas, where access 
to formal credit is often 
limited. 
The expertise that NBFCs 
provide 
is 
underwriting 
risk 
with 
the 
nuanced 
ability to assess income 
and repayment capability 
over the tenor of the loan. 
Furthermore, NBFCs address 
the gap between the Banks 
and 
the 
consumers 
by 
offering 
low-ticket 
loan 
amounts tailored product 
with less paperwork to suit 
the relevant needs of the 
customer.

and brand reputation.
To mitigate this kind 
of risk, we at Paisalo
