Governance, leadership and oversight
7.	
Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, 
targets and achievements.
	
In an era of increasing focus on sustainability, responsible business practices, and stakeholder engagement, 
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) governance has emerged as a crucial aspect of corporate 
management. ESG governance encompasses the systems and processes through which organizations 
integrate environmental, social, and governance considerations into their decision-making, operations, 
and risk management frameworks. For us at FIL, sustainability has been our very essence over the years. 
Anything we do, has to be done well. Every action takes into account the larger picture, at present, and into 
the future. Like the farmers we work for have taught us, the seeds of big ideas we plant today, will only bear 
fruit in the future. And we have the patience and the will to wait. This applies to every aspect of our business: 
our products, processes, profits, and plants. It also extends to our ‘parivaar’- our family of employees, farmers, 
dealers, homeowners, plumbers, and the communities we work with. In every step we take, we keep them 
and the environment in mind. We invest in them, in their future, and in our collective future. 
	
We have embarked on our ESG journey to grow holistically as an organization and create value for all 
our stakeholders. We took our first step in this direction in FY 2021-22 by gaining the ‘Responsible Care’ 
accreditation from the Indian Chemical Council. Through this, we strive to drive continuous improvement 
in safe chemicals management and achieve excellence in environmental, health, safety, and security 
performance. It is our constant endeavour to deliver products and services of the highest quality to our 
customers while ensuring minimal harm to the environment and society. In FY 2021-22, we started our ESG 
journey, and set specific goals on all the three pillars of the ESG i.e., Environment, Social and Governance. 
These goals include reduction of carbon footprint, benchmarking by assessment of biodiversity, tree 
plantation, adoption of policies on ESG and Code of Conduct and also on IT security. As a result, in FY 2023-
24, we have replaced 70% of diesel driven forklifts (from 33% in FY 2022-23) with electric forklifts, reduced 
more than 20,000.00 tCO2e (from 8500 tCO2e in FY 2022-23) through various energy conservation drives, 
recycled more than 2,60,000 m3 of treated effluent back to process, harvested more than 3,15,000.00 m3 rain 
water, increased the share of renewable energy from 0% in FY 2022-23 to 3.2% in FY 2023-24 and adopted our 
ESG policy. 
	
Over these last four decades, we feel we are just getting started, and the hardest work still lies ahead of 
us, and that is what fills us with purpose and excitement for the future. The legacy we have built so far 
has brought together a large, thriving family. It is a legacy that unites. It is a legacy that makes the future 
bright and filled with possibilities. We all know that the climate change is the biggest business challenge in 
coming years since we are experiencing an unprecedented scale of the extreme weather events such as heat 
waves, floods, cyclones. To ensure the positive environmental footprint, we are focusing on enhanced use 
of renewable energy resources as well as the reduction of specific energy consumption. It is our collective 
responsibility to take care of mother earth and use natural resources efficiently at each of our manufacturing 
facilities.

Yes. The Company strives to ensure that it provides a safe and efficient workplace, well-being and safety 
by providing the highest safety standards. The Company has in place Safety Health and Environment 
(SHE) policy to ensure a safe and healthy working environment across all plants and offices with required 
safety protocols. 
	
	
As part of Company’s Integrated Management system, FIL is certified with ISO 9001 - Quality, ISO 14001 
- Environment and ISO 45001 - Occupational Health and Safety. FIL is involved in different activities to 
ensure the safety of employees from hazards, work-related injuries, recordable work related injuries,

The Company successfully implemented Process Safety management System (PSM). FIL’s PSM system 
consists of 11 elements and 27 procedures. PSM elements guides on risk assessment and hazard control, 
standardized way of operation and maintenance (SOP/SMP), mechanical integrity and reliability of 
equipment and system. Safe work practices cover material handling, road transportation of material, 
lifting of equipment and standardization of PPE. All incidents including near misses are reported, 
investigated, and analysed for corrective actions.
	
b.	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and 
non-routine basis by the entity?
	
	
Pre-start up Safety Review (PSSR) is followed prior to start up to ensure that all safety systems are in place. 
Considering complexity of process and known hazards, the Company follows below methodologies to 
address the risks: 
	
	
1	
Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) Study - Hazard & Operability study (HAZOP) is a systematic way 
to identify possible SHE hazards in the system and suggest recommendations. It is a process of 
examining Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&IDs) by applying guide words and parameters 
to all pipes and vessels in the process. This explicitly identifies the hazards, the potential failures, 
and the potential causes of failure and the recommended actions to address the issues. 
	
	
2	
Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) - FMEA study is conducted for critical equipment and 
processes. The Company uses it to design a process, review and improve a process which further 
acts as an efficient process control. Its’ step-by-step approach identifies each failure mode, with 
the analysis, then estimating the effects of failure and devising ways of controlling the process so 
that failure can be prevented. 
	
	
3	
Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) - This analysis method is mainly used in Safety engineering and reliability 
engineering to understand how systems can fail and to identify the best ways to reduce the risk or 
to determine event rates of an accident or a particular system failure. This helps the Company in 
highlighting the critical components related to system failure and to prioritize the action items in 
order to solve the problems. 
	
	
4	
What-if method - It is done for critical equipment where failure is possible by different modes and 
failure can cause a hazardous situation. 
	
	
5	
Job Safety Analysis (JSA)/ Task Risk analysis - JSA is conducted for any jobs involving high risk & 
critical job. 
	
	
6	
Reporting of unsafe condition - Any worker / employee from any department can report unsafe 
condition from the work premises related to safe operation of the process. 
	
	
7	
Other Measures such as Safety Walk, Safety Audit and Safety Report are carried to identify work-
related hazards and assess risks.
	
c.	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work related hazards and to remove 
themselves from such risks. (Y/N)
	
	
Yes. The Company ensures that it continuously reviews and improves health and safety performances. All 
activities relating to monitoring, emergency handling, and team review are supervised and directed by 
the Director-Technical cum Occupier. The safety committee consists of members from both executive 
and workers category which addresses the safety concerns to ensure highest safety at office and plant 
23
locations. Self-spot audit reporting system has been developed to assess the work at plant & reporting 
unsafe act and conditions by workers. To further improve awareness on HSE, the Company had organized 
various programmes such as National Safety Week, Fire Service Week and World Environment Week. 
These programmes covered imparting training on work place safety, fire prevention and control, 
conducting quiz and poster competitions and safeguarding health of the workers by taking safety & 
environment oath.
	
d.
