Schaeffler India Limited | Integrated Annual Report 2023
About the report 
Integrated thinking 
at Schaeffler
Scope and boundary of reporting
Approach to reporting
Schaeffler India Limited’s Integrated Annual Report is 
prepared in accordance with the international Integrated 
Reporting <IR> framework, issued by the Value Reporting 
Foundation. This report reflects our commitment to 
stakeholders for transparent communication and provides 
a detailed assessment of our ability to create sustainable 
value in the short, medium, and long term.
The report focuses on the Company’s achievements, its 
model of value creation, holistic performance, strategy, risk 
management, megatrends and opportunities and financial 
and non-financial performance including Environmental, 
Social, and Governance (ESG) initiatives.
Reporting Period
January 01, 2023 – December 31, 2023
Operating businesses
The report covers the strategic, financial, and non-financial 
performance of businesses, including various manufacturing 
operations and supply chains.
Financial and non-financial reporting
The report extends beyond financial reporting and 
includes non-financial performance, opportunities, risks, 
and outcomes attributable to or associated with our key 
stakeholders, which have a significant influence on our 
ability to create value.
Responsibility statement
The integrity of the information presented in this report is 
verified by the management and the Board of Schaeffler 
India Limited to the best of their knowledge.
Key concepts
Value creation process
At Schaeffler India, we believe value creation is 
focused on optimising value (outcomes and outputs) for our 
stakeholders. This is a consequence of how we allocate 
and enhance our ‘capitals’. The capitals are stocks of value 
that are increased, decreased, or transformed through 
the activities of the organisation.
Simplified presentation of value creation 
process
Input ▸ Outputs 
Outcome ▸ Stakeholders
  Read more about our value creation model on page 22
Materiality and material matters
We apply the principle of materiality to assess what 
information should be included in the integrated annual 
report. We focus particularly on those issues, opportunities, 
and challenges that impact materially on the ability to create 
and deliver value in the short, medium, and long term.
  Read more about our material issues on page 20

Empowering future,

is 7.5 lakh crores and is expected to reach 15 lakh crores 
backed by economic growth and investment in the national 
highway network. Over the past few decades, the Indian 
automotive industry has transformed with technology 
playing a key role in the massive change. The automotive 
landscape in India is undergoing a transformation with 
Indian mobility changing to bigger and greener vehicles 
driven by regulatory changes.
Within the industrial space - the Indian government’s 
multifaceted approach to bolstering its infrastructure 
sector is commendable. The ‘Make in India’ initiative, skill 
development programs, infrastructure projects, and the 
ease of doing business reforms are paving the way for a 
more robust and competitive landscape. The government’s 
emphasis on the railway sector is seen in a number of 
projects aimed at updating and enhancing the railways to 
make them more sustainable and efficient. Achieving the 
targets for clean energy adoption also remains a focus area 
with various policies and incentives being introduced to 
promote wind power development.
Schaeffler India is well placed to capture these opportunities 
as we introduce and adopt innovative technologies at an 
even quicker pace, be it our advances in electric mobility, 
strengthening digitalisation initiatives or offerings of 
Industry 4.0 solutions.
Throughout the year, we have remained steadfast in our 
commitment to delivering value to customers, employees, 
and shareholders. Our strategic initiatives have focused on 
innovation, operational excellence, and sustainable growth, 
which have enabled us to strengthen the market position 
and capitalise on emerging opportunities. It gives me 
immense pride to share that Schaeffler India today stands 
strong as a H72,261 mn company and an employee strength 
of ~3,300 resulting in a market capitalisation of ~H500 bn. 
This growth is a testament to the dedication and hard work 
of employees, confidence of stakeholders and a resilient 
business model.
Empowering change: Our ESG commitment
At Schaeffler, we recognise the importance of integrating 
sustainability into every business aspect to drive long-term 
value creation for all stakeholders. Over the past year, we 
have continued to make significant strides in advancing ESG 
efforts across all aspects of operations.
We remain dedicated to minimising our environmental 
footprint and mitigating the impacts of our business 
activities on the planet. We successfully implemented and 
executed projects in several key areas. We focused on using 
renewable energy across all operations and working towards 
replacing conventional technologies thereby reducing 
emissions at the plants. Activities on Scope 3 emission 
reduction included an evaluation of self-assessment 
questionnaires for ~89% of our suppliers, returnable 
packaging solutions for ~50% of our customers’ packages, 
and consolidated distribution centres. We are set on the 
right track to achieve our ambitious target of being climate-
neutral in our operations by 2030.
Our commitment to social responsibility extends beyond 
business operations to the communities in which we 
operate. Within business operations, we are creating a 
positive social impact by fostering diversity and inclusion 
and supporting employee well-being and safety. And on 
community, we continued to have programmes on water 
conservation, skill development, enhancing the quality of 
education in rural India and improving community health to 
strengthen the social fabric and contribute to the betterment 
of society. During the year, we received multiple recognitions 
for Jal Sahara - our initiative to tackle water scarcity through 
natural resource management.
Sound governance practices are fundamental to maintaining 
the trust and confidence of our stakeholders. The core 
principles of corporate governance at Schaeffler India 
are integrity, accountability, business ethics, effective 
supervision and creating value for stakeholders. We aim to 
achieve business excellence through responsible corporate 
governance, ensuring effective collaboration between the 
Executive Leadership Team and the Board of Directors, with 
transparency in corporate and financial communications. 
We remain dedicated to upholding the highest standards of 
corporate governance, transparency, and ethical conduct.
As we look to the future, Schaeffler India remains firmly 
committed to advancing its ESG agenda and integrating 
sustainability into our business strategy.
In conclusion
Ms. Hardevi Vazirani has recently taken over the reins 
of Schaeffler India’s finances from Mr. Satish Patel. I am 
delighted that we are able to find a great fit within the 
organisation, for such an important position. I thank Satish 
for navigating us throughout these years and contributing to 
the growth of our India entity.
I look back at 2023 as a year where we weathered 
challenges, embraced change, and grew stronger, solidifying 
our commitment to a sustainable future.
I am deeply grateful for the unwavering support of the 
Board of Directors. I would also like to extend my sincere 
appreciation to our employees, esteemed customers 
and partners for their collaboration, and gratitude to our 
shareholders. The progress we made goes beyond numbers 
for fostering innovation, improving operational excellence, 
and building a more responsible future.
The journey ahead fills us with excitement, as we continue 
to forge strong partnerships, innovate, and embrace the 
opportunities that lie ahead. Together, let us embark on this 
journey of growth and boundless potential. India’s future is 
bright, and we are honoured to be a part of its narrative.

Schaeffler India is well placed to 
capture these opportunities as we 
introduce and adopt innovative 
technologies at an even quicker pace, 
be it our advances in electric mobility,

or offerings of Industry 4.0 solutions.”
Dear Stakeholders,
It is with great pleasure that I present to you the Company’s 
Integrated Annual Report for the calendar year 2023. The 
year was a truly special year for Schaeffler India, and I am 
honoured to reflect on the progress and achievements we 
have made together. In addition to another year of resilient 
financial performance, we had many firsts to our credit this 
year. We completed our first acquisition in India, secured 
wins in the area of future mobility and took further strides 
in localisation and digitalisation initiatives. The addition 
of a B2B e-commerce platform in our portfolio presents an 
ideal synergy for Schaeffler’s future aftersales activities in 
India. It will be a key enabler for the aftermarket ecosystem, 
including distribution partners and help to play an important 
role in the fast-growing and evolving aftermarket digital 
landscape. With our new project nomination in the area of 
future mobility, we would be offering a first system-level 
solution to our customers as we help them transition to 
a greener future. We continued to leverage on our local 
strengths and our performance in a challenging environment 
is a testimony to our perseverance.
Reviewing the operating environment
Despite global headwinds and worsening geopolitical 
situation, India promises to remain the fastest-growing 
large economy for another year. In fact, after strong growth 
in the second quarter of FY2024, the Reserve Bank of India 
has raised its growth forecast for the year to 7%. In FY25, 
on the back of the government’s support towards growth, 
controlled inflation and strong thrust on capital expenditure, 
private investment and healthy demand conditions, India is 
expected to continue with a growth trajectory. In the IPSOS 
index of December 2023, India with 64.3 points was at the 
top of the index in the world.
The optimism was evident from the automobile numbers. 
India is now the third-largest automobile market in the 
world. Indian light-vehicle sales, comprising of cars and 
light commercial vehicles, will grow to 6.1 million units in 
2030 from 4.4 million units in 2022, according to an S&P 
Global Mobility forecast. The market size of the industry

Message from the MD and CEO
Our journey in 2023 —  
a year of firsts 
Most importantly, we completed our first-ever acquisition in 
India and the first acquisition in the automotive aftermarket 
space with Koovers. I am very impressed by the motivated, 
and competent team we have at Koovers, particularly the 
Data Analytics, Customer Order management, and IT team, 
among others. We will work with the team to capitalise on 
the growth opportunities this business has to offer. I wish 
the team all the very best.
Another remarkable achievement that I would like to 
highlight is our foray into future mobility from one of the 
large players in the segment, thus taking our first step in 
India’s electrifying journey.
This year, Schaeffler India embraced digitalisation even 
further, transforming the way we work and interact with 
customers. We went beyond automating routine processes, 
building a digital ecosystem that streamlined operations, 
boosted efficiency, and enhanced customer experience. 
From automating the entire supplier payment process to 
creating an online platform for distributors to automating all 
HR processes, we have woven digital threads into the fabric 
of our business. On the production line, smart technologies 
are ensuring precision and quality control like never before. 
This digital metamorphosis is a testament to our agility, 
transparency, and intelligent collaboration to build the 
future of motion.
Sustainability remains at the heart of our every action. We 
continued to work on reducing our environmental footprint 
through the year, inching further towards becoming a 
carbon-neutral company. We have action fields defined 
covering the three ESG dimensions – Environment, 
Social, and Governance. I am happy to share that we have 
performed in this direction and achieved our targets for the 
year across areas of energy efficiency, usage of renewable 
energy, freshwater reduction, zero waste to landfill, accident 
rate and fostering a more equitable and representative 
environment for all. Our commitment extends beyond our 
factories, to the communities we call home, and are actively 
involved in CSR initiatives.
We are focused on integrating sustainability into our 
organisational culture and have implemented ESG targets 
in our performance measures. We understand that 
sustainability goals can be achieved together with a strong 
ecosystem, and we continue to prioritise sustainability in 
all aspects of our operations and strive for even greater 
successes in the future.
We continue to invest in talent development, nurturing 
a diverse and inclusive workforce, ready to lead us into 
the future. We championed gender equality, exceeding set 
targets and setting a benchmark for others to follow. I would 
also like to mention about the new leadership changes 
we saw during the year – we strengthened our leadership 
with the appointment of Mr. Aashish Bhatia to lead our 
Automotive Technologies business and Mr. Seshan Iyer to 
lead our Industrial business and Mr. Vinod Acharya to lead 
our Purchasing function. With their fresh perspective and 
proven expertise, I am confident that these leaders will help 
Schaeffler India to scale higher.
Looking ahead, we are excited about the opportunities that 
lie ahead of us. We will continue to invest in innovation, 
leveraging emerging technologies to drive efficiency, 
enhance customer experiences, and unlock new growth 
avenues. As we look ahead, the horizon pulsates with 
the promise of even greater strides. We stay focused 
on our strategic priorities and continue to invest in 
R&D, digitalisation, and strategic partnerships, fuelling 
innovation and solidifying our position as a leading motion 
technology company.
On behalf of the entire team, I want to express my gratitude 
to all our stakeholders for their continued confidence in 
Schaeffler India’s vision and strategy. Together, let us keep 
the wheels of progress turning, propelling India towards a 
brighter, more sustainable tomorrow. Thank you for being 
a part of our journey.

Even when the world was slowing down, 
India’s progress kept moving forward. 
And we played our role as catalysts to 
support the same, propelling industries 
forward with innovative and sustainable 
solutions. Beyond numbers, our story is 
one of agility.”
Dear Stakeholders,
Schaeffler India has had a remarkable journey in the year 
2023. It has been a year of milestones where we have 
responded to challenging business environments with 
agility and resilience. I am proud to report that despite the 
challenges we faced, our business has continued to thrive 
and grow. The resilience and dedication of our team, 
coupled with our unwavering commitment to innovation 
and excellence, has propelled us forward even in the face 
of uncertainty.
Following the post-pandemic rapid growth years of 2021 
and 2022, 2023 presented unique difficulties. The second 
half of this year saw the pandemic-induced chip shortages 
settling down. This resulted in automotive manufacturers 
being able to meet the high demand for automotives 
in general and SUVs in particular, resulting in a strong 
turnaround in the automotive segment. Our automotive 
technologies as well as automotive aftermarket business 
registered double-digit revenue growth. Our industrial 
business showed sustainable growth with revival in 
our key sectors and government policy support towards 
the infrastructure sector. Exports were under pressure, 
especially with the wind segment in Europe bearing the 
brunt of war and sanctions. However, the sector has now 
started registering an uptick and we continue to invest in 
this sector. 
Once more, even when the world was slowing down, 
India’s progress kept moving forward. And we played 
our role as catalysts to support the same, propelling 
industries forward with innovative and sustainable 
solutions. Beyond numbers, our story is one of agility. 
Like I mentioned earlier, this was a year of milestones for 
us. The year started with the ground-breaking ceremony 
for our new greenfield facility in Hosur, a beacon of 
sustainable manufacturing in India. The Savli facility 
expanded with the future-forward production lines. The 
enhanced production capacity will support the growing 
market demand in the wind, heavy industries, and railway 
sectors. It also supports the country’s ‘Make In India’ call 
and we are proud to contribute towards the initiative.

The future holds immense promise,

Dear Stakeholders,
Today, as I address you for the first time, as CFO of Schaeffler 
India I feel excitement and a sense of healthy trepidation. 
Taking the helm as CFO and Director Finance in a company as 
renowned as Schaeffler India is both an immense privilege 
and a humbling responsibility. Before I embark on this 
new adventure, I want to extend my heartfelt gratitude to 
Satish. Your meticulous financial stewardship and insightful 
guidance have laid the foundation for the robust organisation 
we stand on today. I am honoured to inherit such a legacy 
and will strive to build upon it to the best of my abilities.
We performed well in the year 2023 amidst various 
challenges. Our revenue stood at H72,261 million, a growth 
of 5.2% as compared to CY22. We continued to record 
strong growth of 9.2% in our domestic business. Automotive 
technologies and automotive aftermarket registered double 
digit growth of 11.7% and 14.8% respectively as compared 
to the same period last year. The industrial business also 
recorded a growth of 5.1% despite some of the key sectors 
being impacted in the first half of the year. We saw exports 
being impacted during the year due to external economic 
headwinds and global slowdown.
Our trajectory of business wins continued through the year 
and we also successfully made inroads into the e-mobility 
sector. The introduction of new products and services 
across Automotive Technologies, Automotive Aftermarket, 
and Industrial businesses contributed favourably to 
the revenue growth of our domestic business. We enter 
2024, with committed efforts to leverage on the market 
growth opportunities.
Our EBITDA (before exceptional items) for the year stood at 
H13,528 million, an increase of 3.4% from H13,076 million 
in the previous year. EBITDA margins for the year stood at 
18.7% as compared to 19.0% for CY22. We successfully 
Dear Stakeholders,
I am writing to you with gratitude and a deep sense of pride 
as I transition from my role as the Chief Financial Officer and 
Director Finance at Schaeffler India. The past 3 decades with 
the company in various positions including two decades 
as a CFO have been a remarkable journey, filled with 
ever-evolving challenges and exhilarating successes.
In this time, together, we have navigated shifting economic 
landscapes, embraced technological advancements and 
sustainable practices. We have redefined the possibilities 
for the future for motion and mobility. I have been lucky 
to see the transformation of Schaeffler into a motion 
technology company. Looking back over the past five years, 
we have witnessed a 10.6% compound annual growth rate 
in revenue, a 14.8% increase in exports, 19.8% rise in our 
profits and 3.5% increase in our employee base. These 
figures, however, are only a fraction of the story.
The true measure of our success is evident in the spirit of 
collaboration with our stakeholders, the relentless pursuit 
of innovation, and the commitment to excellence that define 
sustained the quality of our earnings on the back of 
efficient utilisation and productivity measures. PAT stood at 
H9,090 million during CY23 (PAT margin 12.6% vs 12.8% in 
the previous year), representing a 3.4% growth compared to 
CY22. The Earnings Per Share (EPS) was at H58.2 in CY23, up 
from H56.3 in CY22.
During the year, we continued to maintain working capital at 
optimal levels while continuing the trajectory of investments 
for our capex framework. This has led to the generation of a 
strong Free Cash Flow (before cash in and outflows for M&A 
activities) of H4,620 million during the year. We continued 
our consistent approach to shareholder value creation by 
announcing a dividend of H26 per equity share (with a face 
value of H2 per share), reflecting a pay-out ratio of 45% thus 
maintaining our target pay-out ratio of 30-50% of the annual 
standalone Profit After Tax (PAT).
While improving our dividends, we focused on our capex 
framework in sync with our growth plans in India. We 
remain committed to providing sustainable, long-term value 
to our shareholders through a balanced approach that 
includes both capital appreciation and dividend payments. 
At the same time, we are aware of our responsibility to all 
stakeholders for true sustainable growth. Thus, we continue 
to make significant strides in our ESG journey including 
making sustainability integral to our operations.
As we enter CY24, I want to reiterate our dedication to 
executing our strategic focus areas while fulfilling ESG 
commitments. I look forward to yet another exciting year. 
I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to all our 
stakeholders for their relentless support, encouragement, 
and trust in Schaeffler India’s vision to create sustainable 
value and shape the future.
Hardevi Vazirani
Director - Finance & CFO 
Schaeffler India. We have fostered a culture of empowerment 
for our customers, employees, partners and suppliers. 
As I hand the reins to Hardevi Vazirani, I do so with the 
utmost confidence. Her proven expertise, strategic vision,

this magnificent legacy. While I move on to new horizons, 
my bond with Schaeffler India remains untarnished. I will 
be your ardent supporter, cheering you on as you write new 
chapters in the Company’s illustrious story.

wishes for a future brimming with opportunity and success.

Focus on renewable energy
India has set an ambitious target of deriving 50% of energy 
through renewable energy sources by 2030 and wind farms 
are expected to contribute ~100 GW from current 53 GW in 
this energy mix. 
India’s focus on hydrogen
The Government of India is focusing on green hydrogen. 
The Interim Budget for 2024-25 allocated H600 crore for the 
National Green Hydrogen Mission, compared to the previous 
year’s budget of H297 crore.
Strategic focus areas 
Expansion of industrial production capacity
Expansion at Schaeffler India’s facility in Savli and Vadodara 
Gujarat, adds to the manufacturing capacity for small and 
medium-size products, further enhancing Schaeffler’s 
market competitiveness in the region. The expansion of 
the Savli plant’s production capacity is marked as a vital 
step towards driving localisation strategy and meeting the 
growing demands. 
The facility enables us to add capacities of over 10,000 
sq.m. of production space, to the existing state-of-the-art 
manufacturing plant. This enabled the manufacturing of 
spherical roller bearings (SRB) and spherical rollers, while 
also expanding the heat treatment capabilities. This will 
also help to cater to the market demand in the wind, heavy 
industries, and railway sectors. 
With this expansion also comes an increase in employment 
opportunities. By 2025-2026, Schaeffler India expects the 
employee strength at the Savli plant to double, signifying 
the Company’s commitment to creating sustainable 
employment and fostering economic growth in the region. 
It also supports the country’s ‘Make In India’ call, and 
Schaeffler is proud to contribute towards this initiative.

Case study
Customer challenge 
One of the leading OEMs in the wind sector, faced 
a challenging situation of assembling bearings 
on the main shaft in horizontal direction owing 
to limitations from the size of the equipment and 
complexity of mounting.
Application engineering and after sales support 
At Schaeffler, our customers are central 
to everything we do. Our capable 
team of application engineers and 
technical services actively engage 
with customers to not just resolve 
issues at the customer place, but also 
help and enable them to improve their 
process performance. Be it in the 
critical mounting of a steel converter 
trunnion bearing or a large windmill 
main shaft bearing, we address the 
customer needs with their engineering 
support and use of advanced tools 
and equipment, thereby instilling 
a high level of confidence in our 
esteemed customers.
Our approach 
Having understood the nature of concern and applying 
our engineering expertise we could offer the customer 
a fail safe mounting solution in the horizontal axis that 
not only saved time but also associated costs. This 
reinforced our commitment to customer centricity, 
helping us further strengthening our relationship. 
Our agility and resilience helped us to mitigate the headwinds during the year and 
supported our growth. The Industrial business grew 5.1% y-o-y to H25,478 mn this year. 
We made significant business wins in various sectors, solidifying our position as a reliable 
player in providing integrated solutions. Our consistent growth in our Lifetime Solutions 
business is a testimony to our clear focus on our digitization drive. 
We are continuously adopting and employing new technologies through lean 
manufacturing practices, digitalisation, and renewable energy integration. 
Our manufacturing sites demonstrate the practice of reuse, recycle and reduce. 
We also believe that our distribution partners have been instrumental in our growth and 
we continue to invest in enhancing our channel network, 
competence and presence. 
We continue to invest in India ramping up our manufacturing 
footprints, embrace innovation in a rapidly evolving industrial 
landscape and to accelerate the transition to a greener future.”

development to circular economy – into account at the 
designing stage. The circular economy strategy focuses 
on reuse, repair, refurbish, re-manufacture and recycle. 
We send all our metal scrap, plastic packaging scrap 
and other types of scrap to authorised recyclers/re-
processors. It is ensured that the raw materials from the 
foundry and packing materials from the manufacturers 
contain the recycled content of metal and plastic, 
respectively. Further, plastic waste generated during 
the moulding process is recycled into the process. 
Hazardous wastes like used oil and waste oil are sent 
to CPCB-authorised re-processors. Efforts are made to 
co-process other hazardous wastes in collaboration with 
cement industries.

Reducing and reutilising waste
To manage our waste, we implement various efficient waste 
management initiatives that consider environmental impact, 
social effects, and commercial viability. We dispose of our 
hazardous waste at a government-approved central landfill, 
while our non-hazardous waste is recycled by sending it to 
authorised recyclers.

Installation of high-efficiency VSD air 
compressor
The VSD technology closely follows the air demand by 
automatically adjusting the motor speed. This results 
in massive energy savings of up to 35%. In addition, 
lowered system pressure with VSD minimises energy use 
across production. After installation of the compressor, 
verified savings is 491MWh/year.

Schaeffler India locations use water primarily for sanitation, 
cooling and industrial applications. We are working towards 
systematically reducing dependence to minimise water-
related production risks. A variety of projects were planned 
during the year to reduce water withdrawal and recycle 
withdrawn water.
We reduced the power consumption of the Sulfate Removal 
Unit (SRU) by processing high-salt concentrated Dipping 
Basin Water and adding this water to SBM instead of 
De-Mineralised Water (DM Water). This helped reduce 
DM Water (90 KL per annum) and 168 MWh electricity 
consumption per annum.
Green products
Along with using green energy, Schaeffler also takes 
pride in its approach towards green products. CO2e 
reduction is integrated into the product development 
process, including product design and material 
selection We are developing several components and 
system solutions for e-mobility. We also plan to reduce 
our warehousing and reduce waste and scrap in the 
Automotive Aftermarket division.
Progress in 2023 
In our sustainability pursuits, we have adopted various 
measures to improve energy efficiency, reduce water 
footprint, transform employee safety culture and bring 
inclusivity and diversity to the workforce. We are working 
to increase our Renewable Energy proportion by signing 
Power Purchase Agreements with renewable energy 
generators in Gujarat, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, 
where we have manufacturing facilities. Such measures 
have provided impetus for conserving natural resources 
along with a platform to develop synergies within 
the workforce.

Schaeffler’s energy efficiency 
measuring and tracking web tool
With a web tool developed by the 
Group, and implemented in India as 
well, we measure, plan, implement 
and verify our energy efficiency 
programmes. This tool is widely used 
across our manufacturing facilities as 
well as our corporate offices. 
At Schaeffler, the targets to improve energy efficiency 
and reduce water usage are decided at the beginning of 
the year. In 2023, we implemented projects/initiatives, 
verified by an external audit agency, across all 
our plants.
To achieve energy efficiency (energy consumed 
measured in kWh/ MWh), identifying and addressing air 
leaks promptly can save industrial set-ups from wasting 
air and escalating energy costs. It also optimises system 
efficiency, ensures equipment longevity, improves air 
efficiency, and reduces the carbon footprint across 
our plants. Air consumption is 20-25% of total plant 
consumption weightage.
Expected savings of ~250T Euro every 
quarter. 
To reduce water consumption (in m3):
•	 Implemented reuse of the STP Treated water at 
non-contact washroom points
•	 Re-use of RO reject

Building our brand
Creating a strong identity
At Schaeffler, we follow a Branded House strategy that centres around the 
Schaeffler corporate brand as our overarching brand, uniting all products 
and divisions under one roof. 
Creating a strong resonance between our stakeholders and our brand, Schaeffler India has been on a mission to solidify 
its brand identity among all stakeholders. This year, we have amplified our efforts with a multi-channel brand campaign 
encompassing print, digital media, and OTT commercials to foster cultural connections with stakeholders within our 
global framework.
We have built a strong brand connection by developing four key motifs representing our strategic pillars. These impactful 
motifs were prominently showcased across digital platforms and major city airports like Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, 
and Pune. This integrated approach has significantly boosted Schaeffler’s brand recognition in India, earning trust and 
awareness from our diverse stakeholders while staying true to our core values and deep Indian market connection.
Selected strategic pillars of the India campaign
Connecting with the roots
Puneri Paltan, backed by Schaeffler India, secured 
victory in the 10th season of Pro Kabaddi League, 
connecting deeply with our Indian roots. Kabaddi, the 
nation’s second-most watched sport after cricket in 
many Indian cities, strengthens our brand’s bond with 
India, amplifying our presence in the competitive market.

vehicles - internal combustion engines and 
electric vehicles used in student formula racing.
OTT commercials
The digital era has revolutionised the way people consume media and entertainment. We launched two commercials over the 
rising of Over-The-Top (OTT) platforms during the year to widen our reach.
We pioneer motion 
We operate almost anywhere from the world where 
things need to move, always seeking to maintain our 
technological leadership.
Agility 
As markets become more dynamic, and technology more 
complex, you need to respond quickly to changing trends, 
so the customer has the right solution at the right time.
Quality 
Schaeffler has been a local partner in Asia for over 
70 years. Sharing our German expertise and local 
knowledge, we drive transformation together.
Sustainability 
If you are to take sustainability seriously, you have to 
approach it holistically. This is why it is a top priority 
at Schaeffler.

Supplier Innovation Hour
The Schaeffler Supplier Innovation Hour is a global digital 
initiative where suppliers present their ideas directly 
to Schaeffler decision makers. After seven successful 
Innovation Hours across various regions and themes, 
we were excited to bring the Innovation Hour in India. 
Suppliers play a crucial role in driving innovation with us. 
Therefore, we launched series of events to turn outstanding 
ideas into winning products and solutions. We invited 
our existing and potential suppliers to showcase their 
innovation on four different themes of sustainability 
viz. Green Production, Green Material, Green Data, and 
Green Energy.
We offered a chance to suppliers with the best ideas by 
onboarding them into our supplier pool and engaging in 
deeper discussions. We received an overwhelming response, 
and we have shortlisted 7 suppliers to explore further and 
evaluate the value proposition and how they can further 
collaborate with us.
Green Purchasing 
For the Schaeffler Group, the Green Purchasing element 
primarily refers to the purchase of low-emission materials 
and services. In line with our global purchasing strategy, we 
are working on promoting active dialogue with our existing 
and future suppliers, prioritising CO2 reduction across 
the supply chain. In India, we collaborated with key steel 
mills and component manufacturers to work in the area 
of decarbonisation. 
Supplier Certifications
We require that our suppliers meet certain standards in quality, environmental management, occupational health and 
safety, and social responsibility. We emphasise and promote that our suppliers meet not only the standards defined but go 
beyond and also comply with ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 to ensure that our supply chain operates in a responsible and 
sustainable manner. 
In addition, we also have the Schaeffler Code of Conduct set out to ensure we meet expectations for ethical behavior, human 
rights, labor standards, sustainability and regulatory compliance thereby ensuring value creation for all our stakeholders. 
2023 has been a year of growth, collaboration, and significant strides towards a more 
sustainable future. We thank our supplier partners for having played an instrumental role and 
I am immensely proud of the progress we have made together. 
In our ongoing commitment to excellence, we are renewing our focus on the digitalisation 
journey and I am excited to share with you its profound impact on our collaboration with 
suppliers. 
We are working with our suppliers to increase our local presence as we continue on our 
growth journey and introduce new products. Backed by the government’s ‘Make in India’ 
initiative, localisation remains a strategic topic for us and we continue to progressively 
contribute towards this initiative. 
We are committed to investing in our suppliers responsibly and giving them the tools and 
assistance they require. Our aim is to create a supply chain that is sustainable, and we believe 
that collaborating with our suppliers is key to reaching this goal. 
As we look ahead to the coming year, I am optimistic about the 
opportunities that lie before us. We will continue to prioritise 
sustainability in all aspects of our business, seeking innovative 
solutions and forging strong partnerships to drive positive change.”

Transforming lives through education
Somanathapuram Panchayat Union 
Primary School in Hosur faced the 
challenge of providing adequate 
learning opportunities for its 
65 students. Due to insufficient 
classrooms, students had to sit outside, 
leading to inconveniences during 
monsoons. Determined to offer quality 
education, the school approached us 
for support. 
Considering the situation, we have constructed new 
classrooms that create a conducive learning environment 
and feature interesting aesthetics that inspire and motivate 
students to learn.
The support has been extended to government schools 
located in tribal villages by renovating the toilet blocks and 
provisioning running water facilities, improving the overall 
school infrastructure, aiming to enhance the teaching-
learning environment for the students of Karadikkal and 
Soolakunta Primary Schools in Madakkal Panchayat, 
Krishnagiri district.

GOVERNANCE
The core principles of corporate 
governance at Schaeffler India are 
integrity, accountability, business 
ethics, effective supervision and 
creating value for stakeholders.
We aim to achieve business excellence through responsible 
corporate governance. We ensure effective collaboration 
between the Executive Leadership Team and the Board of 
Directors and ensure transparency in corporate and financial 
communications. We recognise that good governance 
practices are essential to nurturing long-term, sustainable, 
and mutually beneficial relationships with all stakeholders. 
Our commitment to upholding the highest standards of 
ethical behaviour, integrity, and transparency has enabled 
us to build strong and lasting partnerships, also reflected 
in the strong governance rating that we received on the 
governance scorecard from Institutional Investor Advisory 
Services (‘IiAS’).
The IiAS rates corporate governance based on an evaluation 
framework built around the G20/OECD principles, which 
are the globally accepted benchmarks for corporate 
governance, adjusted for the Indian context. Some of the 
parameters considered are rights and equitable treatment 
of shareholders, the role of stakeholders in corporate 
governance, disclosure and transparency, and the 
responsibilities of the Board.

Risk management
Anchor of stability 
A dynamic operating environment comes with risks and opportunities. We stay 
ahead of the curve to mitigate identified risks and leverage potential opportunities.
Organisation and assessment
RMS is driven by your Board of Directors, ably supported 
by the Risk Management Committee (hereinafter ‘RMC’), 
constituted as per the provisions of the Companies Act. 
Details of RMS are set out in a risk management guideline, 
which is made available to the employees responsible for risk 
management and is binding on them. It contains a description 
of the process, the allocation of responsibilities and the 
structure of the risk assessment and reporting thereof. 
Under RMC’s guidance, Risk Management Working Group 
(hereinafter ‘RMWG’) operates. It is an interface between 
various functions/divisions of Schaeffler India Limited 
and RMC of the Board of Directors. While on one hand it 
monitors, reviews, and guides productive implementation 
of risk management at Schaeffler India, on the other hand it 
provides valued feedback to the RMC.
Risk management system structure
Risk Management: An important constituent of Corporate Governance
We have a comprehensive Risk Management System (hereinafter ‘RMS’) to ensure timely identification and evaluating of 
the risks, analysing the mitigation plan in existence to overcome the risks, and identifying potential areas of improvement 
to minimise adverse impact on the Company. Risks are inevitable, as we operate in a dynamic environment. However, by 
implementing RMS, we safeguard and protect its earnings and assets. 
Risk assessment is carried out in a hierarchical format, with 
bottom-up approach. The process owner of each risk area 
assesses the risk, valuates its impact on the Company’s 
earnings and assets, and assesses the risks and does 
valuation of impact with respect to the budget. Also, process 
owner describes the mitigation plan in existence to offset 
adverse impact thereof. If such mitigation plan is insufficient, 
future measures are identified for implementation. RMWG 
analyses the risk assessment so done and provides its inputs 
for further safeguarding the assets. 
The value-added report is presented by RMWG to RMC for 
review. The RMC annually reports to the Board of Directors, 
which ensures they are continually updated on the current 
risk situation of the Company.

•	 SIL is exposed to many potential risks that can 
adversely affect its business operations
•	 Risk Management System (RMS) identifies these risks 
on a timely basis and manages them in accordance 
with its risk strategy
•	 Identification and monitoring of risk factors 
increases risk awareness and ensures continuous

Risk assessment: Done with 
2-dimensional approach
Amount of damage:
•	 Implies financial impact each risk is likely to have on 
assets and/or earnings of the Company
Probability of damage:
•	 Implies likelihood of each risk to impact the assets 
and/or earnings of the Company
Risk Class
Determined as low, medium, and high, based on 
the combination of estimated amount of damage 
and probability of occurrence, as considered for 
net valuation. 
Basis of risk assessment:
•	 Valuation of risks and its impact on current 
year budget
•	 Impact on mid-term business sustainability
Risk Management Policy
All pervading; adopting both top-down and 
bottom-up approach
Risk assessment is done with a two-dimensional 
approach - the amount of damage each risk can have on 
an annual basis and its probability of occurrence. Based 
on the amount of damage, each risk is classified as very 
low, low, medium, and high. The probability of occurrence 
is assessed using percentages and is classified as 
improbable, possible, probable, and high probable. The 
combination of the estimated amount of damage and 
probability of occurrence determines the risk class, which 
can be low, medium, or high based on its impact on net 
assets, financial position, and earnings. 
Each risk is valuated at two stages – before and after 
putting risk mitigation measures, referred to as gross 
and net valuation, respectively. Risks, based on net 
valuation, are assigned to various risk classes using the 
risk matrix.

Strategic risks
Country risks
Changes in the social, political, legal, or economic stability 
within or outside the country could hamper the Company’s 
regular operations or planned future expansion. Changes in 
the political and regulatory environment of markets, in which 
the Company operates, could have an impact on its net 
assets, financial position, and earnings. During 2023, geo-
political situations, supply chain disruptions, inflationary 
pressure on food and energy prices had a dampening impact 
on general consumer sentiments and the global economy. In 
a connected world, India was impacted partially in terms of 
process and raw material cost risks. Further, local conditions 
within India with respect to uneven weather conditions, 
lower cash outlay for agriculture sector and adverse 
sentiments in rural market impacted sectors like Tractors. 
The socio-economic and political risks are 
mitigated with continuous observations of the 
developments in relevant business environment 
and taking appropriate actions in terms of 
changes in strategies to protect the interest of 
the Company. Several proactive countermeasures 
were identified and implemented in order to offset 
the adverse impacts as much as possible.
Low
Strategic market and technology risks
Transformative marketplace changes have been forecasted 
such as reducing diesel penetration, stricter emission norms, 
potential electrification of vehicle powertrain and so on. 
Customers are increasingly looking for bundled offerings of 
products and services. The evolution of our business from 
component-driven to more systems-based could reduce the 
proportion of value added by us. The Government of India 
aims to increase the penetration of electric vehicles in the 
Indian automobile landscape. Accordingly, automobile 
manufacturers continue to emphasise and act towards 
this industry trend. To address the changing priorities of 
Automobile OEMs, our product offerings need to evolve to 
capture the industry requirements.
We are taking various measures to address these 
trends. We continue to focus on development 
of products compliance to latest emission 
norms. Our product offerings include system-
based solutions which are value accretive to our 
customers. We are strategically enhancing our 
local production systems to be more modular 
and aiming towards ‘Factory for Tomorrow’. 
The Company is focusing on development of 
evolving technologies and innovative offerings 
in the e-mobility space. An E-mobility division is 
dedicated to work on solutions for electric motors 
and various control modules. It is helping us to 
penetrate in this growing segment and further 
expand our market position. 
Medium
Operational risks
Market developments 
As the Company is a supplier in the automotive and 
industrial sectors, demand for the Company’s products 
is, to a large extent, driven by macro-economic conditions 
and related cyclical fluctuation. Besides these, in the 
Automotive OEM division, demand is also affected by 
changes in consumption patterns, fuel/commodity prices, 
availability of key components, interest rate levels and so 
on. Cumulatively, these factors lead to significant volatility 
in automobile production. Sales in Industrial division is 
spread across diversified business fields and risk in one 
sector can be offset by opportunity in another sectors. A 
change in forecasted market trends could have an impact on 
the net assets, financial position, and the earnings of both 
Automotive and Industrial markets. 
Markets are analysed on an ongoing basis to 
detect changes in market structure or regulations 
early on. The Company effectively manages 
financial performance through cost efficiency, 
operational efficiency and price excellence 
programmes.

Delivery performance
The ability to deliver consistent performance in terms of 
quality and timely deliveries is a key competitive factor 
for a long-term relationship of trust with customers; 
this competitive factor is being constantly enhanced by 
systematic improvements in production and delivery 
logistics. Several factors impact delivery performance which 
may lead to sales volume loss and thereby increase in 
premium freight and other logistics costs.
The Company has built high-performance 
distribution centres aimed at improving market 
supply and delivery performance with strategic 
logistics locations. Component-sourcing options 
and capacity of critical production lines are 
being enhanced. Also, accuracy of forecasting 
market demands, alternate sourcing, localisation 
are some measures that ensure timely delivery 
performance.
Medium
Procurement risks
Procurement risks arise mainly due to raw materials price 
fluctuations, especially prices of energy and steel, ability 
of suppliers to deliver quality products in time. Adverse 
fluctuations in market prices and/or supplier’s financial 
distress could have an impact on the Company’s financial 
position and earnings. There is constant threat emanating 
from global supply chain disruptions and import restrictions 
due to EXIM policy amendments. 
The Company ensures optimal supply of goods 
and services, focusing on quality, cost, and 
delivery performance. Multiple product sourcing 
and localisation options are continuously 
explored. By negotiating prices and utilising 
economic synergies, the Company is largely able 
to obtain competitive prices. The Company keeps 
a close watch on the operations of its suppliers, by 
deploying dedicated personnel performing quality 
checks, for early signs of distress and be able to 
intervene to secure its interests. Forward buying 
option is undertaken in selected cases.
Low
Information Technology (IT) risks
The importance of the IT systems utilised across various 
functions in the Company is growing. The operability 
of business processes and, therefore, the continuity 
of operations depend on the availability of IT systems. 
Three protection targets – confidentiality, integrity, and 
availability – steer the Company’s IT security management 
and protection of data and IT systems. Unauthorised access 
to IT systems, modification and misappropriation of sensitive 
business data could have an impact on the Company’s net 
assets, financial position, and earnings. 
The Company has highest standards of IT security 
systems and constantly upgrades the IT security 
infrastructure. It educates and trains its employees 
about IT security and what precautions the users 
should take, to ensure that the IT infrastructure, 
business data are adequately protected against 
any possible IT risks. Building redundancy in the 
IT systems (data back up in virtual server and 
fire and water proof cabinet) and the network 
infrastructure (secondary network lines) to 
mitigate the unavailability of data and processes.
Low
Information or cyber security risks
The prevalent threat of cyber attacks remains an area of 
concern for most organisations in an increasingly digital 
space. Cyber security risk is an important and continuous 
focus for the Company. The Company devotes significant 
attention and resources to protect and improve the security 
of its computer systems, software, networks and other 
technology assets. 
Nonetheless, cyber attacks/breaches pose a significant 
threat to the protection of our intellectual property, and that 
of our business partners, from theft, loss, unauthorised 
disclosure, and illegal access or misuse.
Given the increase in both the frequency and sophistication 
of such attacks, the possibility of cyber attacks/breaches 
cannot be entirely ruled out and could have an impact on the 
Company’s net assets, financial position, and earnings.
Cyber security initiatives have been implemented 
to mitigate potential incremental security threats 
from possible security risk exposures. The 
company has reinforced and scaled up the internal 
environment to ensure the network is secured and 
healthy. 
Procedures and other IT security specifications 
supplement the information security regulations of 
the company.
Several technical measures have been established 
for any illegal intrusions and to mitigate the risk 
of cyber-attacks and secure data thefts which also 
includes monitoring the networks for cyber threats 
through Security Operations Centre (SOC) to 
detect and respond to Cyber Security events
We will continuously fortify our cyber security 
defences and place responsible guidelines along 
with security controls to strengthen our security 
roadmap in managing risks in data, IT systems and 
cyber security across the Group businesses.

Production risk
As the Company’s manufacturing facility is capital-intensive, a 
large proportion of its costs are fixed. As a result, a decrease 
in the utilisation of plant capacity leads to under-absorption 
of costs and thereby impacts its earnings adversely. Moreover, 
the influence of force majeure could result in delays or 
interruptions of production and supply chain, leading to non-
fulfilment of market demand. The period between failure at the 
plant and arrangement from an alternative source could impact 
the Company’s net assets, financial position, and earnings. 
The Company regularly reviews market conditions 
and aligns its production plan accordingly, where 
necessary alternative source can be realised from 
another plant within the Schaeffler Group. To 
minimise the probability of occurrence of unplanned 
interruptions, the Company takes extensive fire 
prevention measures. Several cost containment 
measures were identified and implemented in 
material and process cost to overcome.
Medium
Loss of market share
The Company faces competition in all business fields it 
operates in. As a result, the Company is exposed to dual risk 
of either being displaced by existing or new competitors or 
its products being replaced by product innovations or by new 
technological features. Customer dissatisfaction on price, 
quality, delivery performance and design could lead to a loss 
of market share.
The Company ensures close cooperation with 
its key customers on product development. It 
has implemented strict product quality controls 
to reduce the likelihood of substitution. The 
Company is also developing products which 
will help it to step up the value chain from 
components to systems. Unutilised capacity of 
products can be utilised by exploring additional 
opportunities. The Company is focusing on 
increasing its local footprint to comply with local 
content requirements under the Government of 
India’s ‘Make in India’.
Medium
Warranty and liability risks
One of the significant factors in customer decision to 
purchase the products offered by Schaeffler India is quality. 
We employ a certified quality management system besides 
continuously striving to improve our quality processes. 
However, there is a risk that poor quality products may get 
delivered. Usage of defective parts can lead to damages, 
unplanned repairs or recall on the part of customer which can 
result in liability claim or reputational damage. Furthermore, 
this may result in an increase in warranty and liability risk.
The Company responds to such risks by adopting 
strict quality control measures and continually 
improving its production processes to minimise 
the probability of warranty and liability risks 
materialising. Adherence to quality standards 
is strictly implemented. All product and recall 
liability risks are insured. 
Low
Product piracy
Our product brands - INA, LuK, and FAG are associated with 
best-in-class standards of quality, durability, and reliability, 
making them increasingly susceptible to product piracy.
We protect our intellectual property. We continue 
to engrave special markings on our products, 
making it difficult to counterfeit. Secondly, our 
Company follows a strict vigilance process to 
ensure the timely detection of counterfeiting 
instances and the initiation of legal actions 
against the guilty. This is done in association 
with law enforcement agencies. Moreover, a 
digital anti-counterfeit app is upgraded regularly 
to support these initiatives. We evaluate other 
technology-driven initiatives on an ongoing basis 
to overcome this risk. We also conduct awareness 
and engagement activities with our distributors.
Low
Legal risks
Your Company’s operations give rise to legal risks, for instance those resulting from non-compliance with relevant 
regulations. Legal risks are reflected in provisions recognised in accordance with financial reporting standards.
Compliance
As a Company which operations at different locations, it 
must comply with laws and regulations across the country. It 
is possible that violations of any existing law occur, despite 
careful observance of such legal requirements. 
The Company has in place a comprehensive 
Compliance Management System, wherein laws 
and regulations applicable to the Company are 
mapped. Each compliance requirement is mapped 
to relevant process owner. The system sends 
alerts and reminders to each such process owner 
to enable him to comply with the requirements in 
a timely manner. Your Company’s management 
regularly reviews a comprehensive compliance 
report. The system is also updated regularly to 
capture regulatory changes and amendments.

Financial risks
The key financial risks of the Company are listed below.
Tax risks
Your Company is subject to tax audits. Tax authority’s 
interpretation of the tax law or of relevant facts made in 
current or future tax audits may differ from that of the 
Company. This may lead to adjustments to tax base and 
increase in the tax liabilities. An additional tax payment 
because of an adjustment to the tax base may impact on the 
Company’s financial position. 
The Company extensively evaluates Corporate Tax 
and International Tax laws, both internally and 
with external tax experts, before implementing in 
the Company. The implementation strategy is well 
documented, reviewed periodically and amended 
as necessary.
Low
Pension risks
Your Company has pension obligations towards its 
employees. Such obligations are measured using actuarial 
valuation based on assumptions with respect to the discount 
rate, increases in personnel payments and statistical life 
expectancy. Planned assets are invested with external 
agencies, which are subject to fluctuations in value. A 
change in these parameters could have an impact on the 
Company’s net assets. 
The Company uses government bond rate as 
discount rate and invests in pension fund with a 
Government of India enterprise (LIC). Quarterly 
actuarial valuation is carried out, adequate 
provisions are established in books of accounts 
and annually funds are appropriately transferred 
to LIC.
Low
Currency risks
The Company is exposed to currency risks due to its 
cross-border transactions. The largest currency risks from 
operations result from fluctuations in the USD and Euro 
exchange rates.
Your Company has INR as the inter-company 
invoicing currency with German entities. This leads 
to substantial reduction in its foreign exchange 
exposure and nullifies currency volatility impact. 
Additionally, the Company has a structured 
hedging strategy to counter currency risks. The 
strategy is followed consistently and reviewed 
periodically. The company monitors overall FX 
development closely and revisit its FX strategy on 
periodic basis.
Low
Liquidity risks
The risk that your Company will not be able to meet its 
payment obligations as they come due is referred to as 
liquidity risk. Such risks can arise if financing needs cannot 
be met by existing funding arrangements including surplus 
cash balance. Even though your Company is cash surplus 
and does not expect any liquidity risks, it has put efficient 
liquidity management measures to mitigate associated risks. 
It has undertaken multiple measures to mitigate 
risks associated to liquidity management. The 
Company monitors liquidity risks using a rolling 
liquidity plan with a forecast period of twelve 
months. Short term cash flows are monitored 
regularly, involving key stakeholders. The working 
capital controls are adequately in place via 
appropriate actions including benchmarking and 
reviews. Company has a well established credit 
control mechanism to ensure timely collections 
and no loss of receivables. The credit insurance 
is undertaken in order to minimise the credit risk 
and thereby manage the overall liquidity risk in a 
better way.

1. Economic Overview 
1.1 Global
The year 2023 started with what appeared as bleak 
prospects for the global economy, with expectations 
of recession in the developed world following the war, 
creating inflationary pressures and subsequent monetary 
tightening by global central banks. While the political 
situation in the Middle East and market upheavals in China 
should have further exacerbated the situation, the global 
economy remained comparatively stable and continued 
to surprise on the upside. As against the expected growth 
estimate of 2.9% at the beginning of the year, the economy 
unexpectedly grew by 3.1% during the year. Inflationary 
pressures abated slightly, in most regions, thanks to the 
easing of supply-side pressures and restrictive monetary 
policy. The IMF projected global headline inflation rate is 
expected to decrease to 5.8% in 2024 and 4.4% in 2025, 
with the forecast for 2025 revised down. This has led to 
analysts and economists adopting a more optimistic stance 
and being assured of a soft landing,  largely due to resilience 
in the United States and several large emerging markets and 
developing economies. 
The Global Consumer Confidence Index for December 2023 
stood at 47.7, with a 0.5 units gain from the previous month. 
With a score of 64.3, India sits at the top of this index, 
signifying the growth momentum and optimism.
Outlook
With a reduced risk of recession, the IMF is expecting the 
global economy to grow by 3.2% in 2024. The outlook 
is better than what was anticipated a few months back. 
Advanced economies are expected to see growth decline 
slightly in 2024 before rising in 2025, with a recovery in 
the euro area from low growth in 2023 and a moderation 
of growth in the United States. Emerging market and 
developing economies are expected to experience stable 
growth through 2024 and 2025, with regional differences. 
There is still room for positive surprises in the global 
economy, but caution remains on a few persistent risks. 
Potential challenges to global growth reducing the pace 
of the economy include sticky inflation and geopolitical 
uncertainties, including the Red Sea crisis, where freight 
and insurance premiums have gone up significantly and 
shipment volume has reduced.

1.2 India Overview
India continues its strong growth trajectory. As per the 
advanced estimates released by NSO (National Statistical 
Organisation), the Indian economy is expected to grow by 
7.3% for fiscal 2024. RBI also raised the growth estimate 
from the earlier 6.5% to 7% for the same period.
The retail inflation in India for 2023 is projected at 5.4%, 
while CPI inflation has remained above RBI’s target of 4% 
for 50 consecutive months. For FY24, the monetary policy 
committee has kept the CPI inflation forecast unchanged at 
5.4%. It expects inflation to gradually come down in FY25. 
Throughout 2023, India’s manufacturing PMI remained 
above 50, signalling an expanding output, with the PMI 
hitting 56 in November.

The agricultural sector is expected to grow at 1.8% in FY24. 
Manufacturing is expected to grow at 6.5, and construction 
is expected to register a double-digit growth of 10.7%, 
even on a strong base. The auto component industry, which 
contributes around 2.3% of India’s national GDP, is likely to 
grow by 6-9% in FY24, with increased value-addition to meet 
regulatory compliance, fast recovery in exports, and traction 
in the domestic automotive aftermarket. The services 
sector, which accounts for more than half of the economy, 
is estimated to grow by 7.7% in FY24.
Outlook
The IMF expects the Indian economy to grow by 6.5% in 
FY25 following resilience in domestic demand. S&P Global 
Ratings expects India will remain the fastest-growing 
major economy for the next three years, putting it on track 
to become the world’s third-largest economy by 2030,

2. Industry Overview
2.1 Automotive sector review
Global automobile sales are estimated to have increased 
by ~10% to 90.1 million units in 2023 as chip and 
semiconductor shortages started easing in the second half 
of the year. In 2024, the growth is expected to slow to 2.4% 
to 92.2 million units, however, India and China will continue 
to outperform the market. India’s growing income levels, 
lack of effective public transport options, and government’s 
support for E-mobility have led to increasing demand 
for mobility. 
The auto sector is one of the key pillars of Indian industry, 
contributing about 7.5% to our GDP and about 49% to 
manufacturing GDP. It also employs close to 4 crore people 
directly and indirectly. 2023 has been a bumper year in 
terms of car sales and growth, with the industry expecting 
sales of 4.22 million units by the end of the calendar year, an 
8% increase over the previous year.1
Automotive market trends and outlook
Embracing green technology
Action in the EV space picked up during the year, registering 
a 50% growth including, 2-W, 3-W and PVs and CVs. The 
e-bus segment is expected to do well in 2024 on the back 
of the PM E-bus Seva scheme which intends to introduce 
10,000 electric buses in 169 eligible cities through public-
private partnerships. 
The Indian market has transitioned from a small car market 
to an SUV-dominated market. The luxury car segment 
registered nearly double-digit growth in 2023 and is 
expected to maintain the momentum in 2024. Small car 
sales lagged with the share of entry-level PVs reducing from 
14% in 2018‑19 to 4% recently. SUVs share has now reached 
close to 42% and is expected to breach that figure in the 
next year.

Within a short to medium time horizon, India will continue 
to use and adopt a range of power technologies for 
vehicles. In a vast country characterised by diverse needs 
and preferences, internal combustion engines (ICEs), 
compressed natural gas, electricity, hydrogen, flex fuels, 
bio-fuels and hybrid – all technologies will continue to 
co-exist.
Within the space, the Economic Survey of 2023 forecasted 
a remarkable 49% CAGR for India’s domestic EV market 
between 2022 and 2030. This trajectory is anticipated to 
yield a predicted annual sales volume of nearly 10 million 
units by 2030.
Increasing value
The average price of a car has more than doubled in India 
over the past decade to `1,150,000(about $14,000) from 
`450,000 (about $ 5,500). This shows immense opportunity 
for the OEM sector as it reflects customer’s willingness to 
pay for utility, safety and security.
Challenges
A slowdown in rural demand, rising interest rates, supply 
bottlenecks and lack of EV charging infrastructure are some 
of the challenges faced by the industry.
2.2 Industrial sector review
For FY23-24, the construction sector is expected to exhibit 
robust double-digit growth at 10.7%. The government 
expects the manufacturing industry to expand by 6.5%, a 
significant improvement over 1.3% in the previous year. The 
mining and quarrying sector is expected to increase by 8.1% 
in FY24. From April 2023 to November 2023, the IIP growth 
stood at 6.4%, up from 5.6% in the corresponding period 
last year, all pointing towards a good performance by the 
industrial sector. The interim budget for FY25 has put the 
government Capex figure at a strong `11 trillion, showing the 
impetus for infrastructure investments will continue. 
Outlook
The government’s consistent efforts in terms of structural, 
fiscal and infrastructural reforms, together with the demand 
revival, augur well for industrial growth. The PLI scheme will 
aid in keeping investments flowing to scale up industries 
and provide a major boost to infrastructure. Moreover, the 
growth is expected to accelerate with improvements in 
the overall business sentiment on the back of continued 
measures to reduce transaction costs and improve ease of 
doing business.
	 Policy measures for the Auto and Industrial 
sectors
	
PLI Scheme
	
The Indian government increased the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for auto and auto components by 
one year in January 2024, with total indicative incentives amounting to `25,938 crore. For FY 2024-25, the `3,500 
crore has been earmarked for this incentive.
	
Support to e-Mobility
	
The government reiterated support for e-mobility by declaring support for bringing more e-buses on the road 
for public transport through a payment security mechanism. The government also announced and improved the 
charging infrastructure to meet the emission targets.
	
FAME (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles) II Subsidy
	
FAME was first introduced in April 2015, and phase II was launched in April 2019. It aimed to give impetus to the 
purchase of electric and hybrid vehicles by providing financial support and thus making them more affordable. The 
allocation under FAME II for FY 2024-25 is `2,671 crore. Rollout of the new subsidy scheme will be a key for providing 
impetus to the EV sector. 
	
Renewable Energy
	
India aims to achieve a 500 GW renewable energy target before 2030. As of Dec 2023, Renewable energy sources, 
including large hydropower, have a combined installed capacity of 180.79 GW. In the interim budget presented in 
February 2024, the Finance Minister announced that the government will support about one crore households under 
the rooftop solarisation scheme by providing them with up to 300 units of free electricity per month.
	
Strong government Capex continues
	
The recent Interim Budget proposes `11 trillion as Capex for FY 2024-25 to shore up demand and consumption in 
the economy.
	
Record allocation to Railways
	
The Railways have got a record allocation of `2.55 lakh crore in the Budget.
  	 Green Hydrogen
	
The Interim Budget for 2024-25 allocated `600 crore for the National Green Hydrogen Mission, compared to the 
previous year’s budget of `297 crore.

4. Business outlook
The performance for 2023 speaks of our strength and 
adaptability despite the global headwinds. Our domestic 
business continued to deliver in 2023 backed by the 
trajectory of business wins across our sectors. Our 
continued focus on the efficient utilisation of resources and 
productivity measures helped in sustaining the quality of 
our earnings. Strong performance on operating metrics and 
trajectory of investments continued as planned. 
Going forward, we will continue to focus on our strategic 
objectives while dealing with market challenges to achieve 
the targets we have set for ourselves. We are also fully 
committed to achieving our sustainability goals (please 
read the details on page 52) through our well-defined 
ESG strategy.
5. Internal control systems
In In parallel to the risk management system, Schaeffler 
India has a system of internal controls over financial 
reporting (IFC), which ensures the accuracy of the accounting 
system and the related financial reporting. The internal 
control system provides for well-documented policies and 
procedures that are aligned with Schaeffler Group standards 
and processes. It adheres to local statutory requirements 
for orderly and efficient conduct of business, safeguarding 
of assets, the detection and prevention of frauds and 
errors, adequacy and completeness of accounting records 
and timely preparation of reliable financial information. 
The efficacy of the internal checks and control systems are 
validated by internal auditors. 
Our IFC is conceptually based on the regulatory framework, 
as applicable. The controls defined in the framework are 
applied at all levels – entity level, process level and IT 
systems level. 
Each year-end, the management assesses the 
appropriateness and effectiveness of the IFC in place. To 
this end, we use a standardised methodology to identify the 
processes relevant to IFC, define the required controls and 
document them in accordance with uniform requirements. 
This is then followed up with a review of the defined 
controls, which is performed using a risk-based approach. 
The process controls are self-evaluated and are audited 
by the internal and statutory auditors. Wherever control 
weaknesses exist, actions to eliminate them are defined and 
monitored regularly to overcome them.

3.2 Operational performance review
3.2.1 Automotive Technologies segment 
Our Automotive Technologies segment achieved significant 
growth despite the uncertainties in the automotive sector. 
Our consistent focus on innovation paid dividends as our 
product portfolio helped us drive growth. During the year, 
we achieved a breakthrough nomination in the area of 
future mobility with one of India’s leading OEMs. We also 
won business order wins in the area of hybridisation with 
OEM customers and wheel bearings for fully electrified car 
platforms. Our trajectory of business wins in CVs for double-
clutch systems, in PVs for needle bearings, DGBBs, and light 
vehicle clutch systems continued during CY 2023. 
In terms of operational performance, we ramped up major 
projects in engine components and shift systems, which 
will help us play an important role in meeting the upcoming 
Real Driving Emission (RDE) requirements with increased 
reliability for our customers.
3.2.2 Automotive Aftermarket segment
The Automotive Aftermarket business recorded a strong 
growth of 14.8% during the year. Business wins for FEAD/ 
Timing kit, TRBs in the PV segment as well as new product 
launches of wipers and lubricants helped deliver on 
our performance. Our focus on product expansion and 
strengthening our network continued. 
2023 was also a milestone year for us, as we completed 
the acquisition of KRSV Innovative Auto Solutions Private 
Limited (“Koovers”), a Bengaluru-based private limited 
company offering spare parts solutions to Indian aftermarket 
workshops via a B2B e-commerce platform. This acquisition 
will be a key enabler for the aftermarket ecosystem, 
including distribution partners and help to play an 
important role in the fast-growing and evolving aftermarket 
digital landscape.
3.3.3 Industrial segment
The Industrial business, contributing to 35% of the 
revenues, achieved a growth of 5.1% y-o-y. This was on 
the back of our continued trajectory of business wins, 
forays into newer areas of complimentary products and 
maintenance solutions. Strong growth in our mobility 
sectors aided performance for the year. We also saw a 
revival in our key sectors which were impacted during the 
first half of 2023. We could deliver better performance with 
our focus on continuous growth despite the challenging 
external environment. We also significantly strengthened 
our position in services business offerings by introducing 
technologically advanced products and solutions.

Opportunity
Water is one of the crucial 
elements in operations of the 
company. It is not only required 
in production processes, but 
also for domestic processes. 
Taking into account availability 
of fresh water, increasing water 
pollution in society, we have 
identified water management 
as need of the hour.

water is reused for processes, gardening, etc.
•	 Rain water harvesting & ground water 
recharge projects initiated, which will 
reduce water footprint.
•	 Schaeffler India has set a target of 20%

low friction seal for wheelset would help Rail customers reduce energy consumption thereby 
reduce carbon footprint. In that perspective about 25% of ongoing investment in R&D @ 
Industrial business may indirectly result positive impact to environment and social.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details.
	
Yes
	
We have implemented energy efficiency programs to reduce energy consumption, resulting in lower emissions and 
cost savings. Our initiatives on energy efficiency includes optimising operating pressure of centralised compressed air 
system, Installation of High efficiency air compressor, AMF Power Pack modification CNC machines are few initiatives. 
In addition, we are committed to green energy consumption and aim to achieve 100% renewable energy usage by 
2024. We plan to achieve this through power purchase agreements, the installation of our rooftop solar panels, and the 
use of renewable energy certificates. Additionally we have taken a serious concern on reducing the scope1 emission 
by alternate fuels and converting the conventional type furnaces into modern or electric furnaces to reduce 90% of 
emissions. The CO2 emission which cannot be reduced will be adjusted by doing carbon offset program.

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy 
adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes 
and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
	
Schaeffler India has adopted the group EHS policy where it addresses the waste generated in our processes which 
stated are under “Minimum Environmental Impact and Environmentally Friendly Products”. We endeavor to minimize 
environmental impact by taking suitable measures in advance. We consume raw materials and energy sparingly and 
make every effort to minimize waste, wastewater, noise, and other emissions. We manufacture environment friendly 
products considering the entire product lifecycle.
	
In line with our policy, Schaeffler India has taken a ESG target of Zero waste to land fill by carrying out a 3R principle 
to reduce our waste generation, Re-use of the possible wastes and recycling the Hazardous and non-Hazardous 
wastes. We have initiated a project at Savli location where the Hazardous waste generated from our Effluent treatment 
plant is disposed to a cement industry for co-processing which is best alternative to land fill. The same concept will 
be implemented at all the locations to achieve zero waste to landfill by 2025. Pilot Run implemented: 443 tons of 
hazardous waste diverted from landfills & sent for Co-processing to cement industry. Material yield is one of the major 
areas we are working to reduce the scrap from the production process. Automotive plants will take up the target of 
achieving 3% material yield by CY25.
	
The casting & MS scrap generated in the production process are sent back to the Vendors for recycling and our new raw 
material is having recycled content in the material, which will further reduce the Scope 3 emission.
	
Other non-hazardous wastes generated are wood, cartons, paper, gunny bags, plastic wastes and maintenance scraps. 
We have reduced the generation of the paper waste by adopting the digital solutions and reduced about 90% of the 
paper used.
	
Cartons are the major waste in packaging, which is generated when we receive raw materials and in the dispatches of 
the final product to customers. To reduce the packaging waste, Schaeffler India is working with suppliers & customers 
to reduce the packaging wastes and has initiated a returnable packaging material in agreement with more than 50% 
of our suppliers & customers. Wooden pallets are reused internally for the transportation to avoid purchasing of the 
new pallets.
	
For the chemicals and substances, which we use, we have our own control system called BAFF, a substance control system 
which will allows only approved substances for controlling the procurement of non-standard and highly toxic chemicals.
	
Schaeffler in the design stage itself considers optimizing the design of the product and process in coordination with the 
Tooling department to reduce the waste generated during production.
	
We are maintaining the register of declarable substance and we are compliant with REACh and RoHS standards. Also, we 
are abiding by the regulations around conflict of minerals at schaeffler.

(Year 2022: `68,674 million) which is higher by 5.2%. Profit 
before tax (before exceptional items) was `12,284  million

Your Company recorded profit after tax of `9,090 million 
(Year 2022: `8,792 million) which represent a growth of

Global Outlook
The year 2023 started with what appeared as bleak 
prospects for the global economy with expectations of 
recession in the developed world following the war created 
inflationary pressures and subsequent monetary tightening 
by the global central banks. While the political situation 
in the middle east and market upheavals in China should 
have further exacerbated the situation, the global economy 
remained comparatively strong and continued to surprise on 
upside. With reduced risk of recession, and the IMF expects 
the global economy to grow by 3.2% in 2024. Advanced 
economies are expected to see growth decline slightly in 
2024 before rising in 2025, with a recovery in the euro area 
from low growth in 2023 and a moderation of growth in the 
United States. Emerging market and developing economies 
are expected to experience stable growth through 2024 and 
2025, with regional differences. There is still room for more 
positive surprises in global economy, but caution remains on 
a few persistent risks. Potential challenges to global growth 
include sticky inflation, geopolitical uncertainties including 
the red sea crisis where freight and insurance premiums 
have gone up significantly and shipments volume has 
reduced could make the recovery sticky.
India Outlook
India continued its strong growth trajectory during the year. 
As per the advanced estimates released by NSO (National 
Statistical Organization) Indian economy is expected to 
grow by 7.3% for fiscal 2024. RBI also raised the growth 
estimate from the earlier 6.5% to 7% for the same period 
given the robustness observed in the industry sector. 
Strong collections of goods and services taxes, increasing 
automobile sales, consumer confidence, and double-digit 
credit growth indicate that demand for urban consumption 
is still strong. Growing manufacturing and services PMIs 
contribute to the evidence of strong economic momentum 
on the supply side. Although private industrial capital 
spending has been sluggish, this is anticipated to change 
as a result of the continuous benefits of supply chain 
diversification and investor reaction to the government’s 
plan to support important manufacturing industries. An 
improving picture for private investment is seen as a result 
of increasing capacity utilization, strong loan growth, and 
positive sentiment. 
Higher-than-anticipated commodity prices, adverse 
weather conditions and an increase in inflation, though 
not expected, are some of the factors which may impact 
India’s momentum. However, despite these challenges, 
India is expected remain among the fastest growing 
economies globally in the next decade attributed to key 
drivers of digitalization, decarbonization, demographics 
and deglobalization.

Independent Auditor’s Report
To the Members of Schaeffler India Limited
Report on the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Opinion
1.	
We have audited the accompanying standalone 
financial statements of Schaeffler India Limited (‘the 
Company’), which comprise the Balance Sheet as 
at December 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and 
Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the 
Statement of Cash Flow and the Statement of Changes 
in Equity for the year then ended, and notes to the 
standalone financial statements, including a summary 
of the significant accounting policies and other 
explanatory information.
2.	
In our opinion and to the best of our information and 
according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid 
standalone financial statements give the information 
required by the Companies Act, 2013 (‘the Act’) in 
the manner so required and give a true and fair view 
in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards 
(‘Ind AS’) specified under section 133 of the Act read 
with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 
Rules, 2015 and other accounting principles generally 
accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company 
as at December 31, 2023, and its profit (including other 
comprehensive income), its cash flows and the changes 
in equity for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
3.	
We conducted our audit in accordance with the 
Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) 
of the Act. Our responsibilities under those standards 
are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities 
for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements 
section of our report. We are independent of the 
Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued 
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India 
(‘ICAI’) together with the ethical requirements that are 
relevant to our audit of the financial statements under 
the provisions of the Act and the rules thereunder, 
and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities 
in accordance with these requirements and the Code 
of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our opinion.
Key Audit Matters
4.	
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our 
professional judgment, were of most significance in 
our audit of the standalone financial statements of the 
current period. These matters were addressed in the 
context of our audit of the financial statements as a 
whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do 
not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
5.	
We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.
Key audit matter
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Revenue Recognition
(refer note 25 and 48 of the accompanying financial statements)
The Company’s revenue principally comprises sale of goods. 
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised at point in time 
when the control of the goods is transferred to the customers, 
which is on dispatch/delivery in accordance with the terms of 
sales contracts.
We have identified the recognition of revenue as a key audit matter 
since the Company has various customers with different terms 
of trade which increase the risk of error in the timing of revenue 
recognition. Revenue is determined to be an area involving 
significant risk in line with the requirements on Standards of 
Auditing and hence requiring significant auditor attention.
The Company and its external stakeholders focus on revenue 
as a key performance indicator and therefore there could be a 
risk of material misstatement in so far as revenue recognition is 
concerned.
Considering the aforesaid significance to our audit and the 
external stakeholders, revenue recognition has been considered 
as a key audit matter for the current year’s audit.
Our key audit procedures around revenue recognition included, and not 
limited to, the following:
•	 Obtained an understanding of and assessed the design, 
implementation and operating effectiveness of management’s key 
internal financial controls in relation to revenue recognition;
•	 Assessed the appropriateness of the revenue recognition accounting 
policies of the Company including those relating to variable 
consideration, by evaluating compliance with the applicable 
accounting standards.
•	 Selected samples of revenue transactions during the year and 
inspected underlying customer contracts and shipping documents 
to identify the terms and conditions relating to the transfer of control 
of the products sold and assessed the Company’s timing of revenue 
recognition;
•	 Performed analytical review procedures on revenue recognized during 
the year to identify any unusual and/or material variances.
•	 Tested selected samples of revenue transactions recorded before and 
after the financial year end date to determine whether the revenue has 
been recognised in the appropriate financial period.
Evaluated the appropriateness and adequacy of disclosures in the 
standalone financial statements in respect of revenue recognition with the 
applicable standards
Key audit matter
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Related Party Transactions
(refer note 38 of the accompanying financial statements)
The Company has entered into several transactions with related 
parties during the year ended 31 December 2023 and has 
outstanding balances as the year-end.
The Company’s related party transactions comprises purchase and 
sale of goods, purchase of tangible assets, payments for royalty, 
information technology services and other services, guarantee 
commission and reimbursements.
Each related party operates under different jurisdiction and 
applies its own pricing model to be compliant with the respective 
legal and tax (transfer pricing) framework of the respective 
jurisdiction.
We have identified transactions with related parties as a key 
audit matter due to quantum of transactions, completeness of the 
disclosures made in the financial statements, compliance with 
various tax requirements and judgements involved to ensure arm’s 
length pricing, compliance with statutory regulations governing 
related party transactions such as Companies Act, 2013 and 
Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and 
Disclosure Requirements) Regulations 2015 (‘the SEBI listing 
regulations’).
Our key audit procedures around Related party transactions included, and 
not limited to, the following:
•	 Obtained an understanding and assessed the design, implementation 
and operating effectiveness of management’s key internal financial 
controls in relation to identification and disclosure of related party 
transactions and arm’s length assessment.
•	 Assessed the compliance with the SEBI listing regulations and the 
regulations under the Companies Act, 2013, including authorization 
and approvals as specified in Sections 177 and 188 of the Companies 
Act, 2013 with respect to the related party transactions, as applicable.
•	 Evaluated the compliance with Indian Transfer Pricing Regulations with 
respect to arm’s length based on the transfer pricing documentation 
prepared by the Company. This also involved obtaining views from the 
auditor’s internal tax experts regarding the arm’s length pricing.
•	 On a sample basis, inspected relevant ledgers, agreements and 
other information that may indicate the existence of related party 
relationships or transactions. We also assessed the completeness of 
related parties with reference to the various statutory registers and 
declarations maintained by the Company’s management.
Evaluated the adequacy and appropriateness of the disclosures on related 
party transactions in the financial statements with the requirements of the 
applicable accounting standard.
Information other than the Standalone 
Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report 
thereon
6.	
The Company’s Board of Directors are responsible for 
the other information. The other information comprises 
the information included in the annual report, but does 
not include the standalone financial statements and 
our auditor’s report thereon.
	
Our opinion on the standalone financial statements 
does not cover the other information and we do not 
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
	
In connection with our audit of the standalone financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read the other 
information and, in doing so, consider whether the 
other information is materially inconsistent with the 
standalone financial statements or our knowledge 
obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be 
materially misstated.
	
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude 
that there is a material misstatement of this other 
information, we are required to report that fact.
Responsibilities of Management and Those 
Charged with Governance for the Standalone 
Financial Statements
7.	
The accompanying standalone financial statements 
have been approved by the Company’s Board 
of Directors. The Company’s Board of Directors 
are responsible for the matters stated in section 
134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation 
and presentation of these standalone financial 
statements that give a true and fair view of the 
financial position, financial performance including 
other comprehensive income, changes in equity and 
cash flows of the Company in accordance with the Ind 
AS specified under section 133 of the Act and other 
accounting principles generally accepted in India. 
This responsibility also includes maintenance of 
adequate accounting records in accordance with the 
provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of 
the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds 
and other irregularities; selection and application of 
appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and 
estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, 
implementation and maintenance of adequate internal 
financial controls, that were operating effectively 
for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the 
accounting records, relevant to the preparation and 
presentation of the financial statements that give a true 
and fair view and are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.
8.	
In preparing the standalone financial statements, the 
Board of Directors are responsible for assessing the 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless the Board of Directors either intend 
to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has 
no realistic alternative but to do so.
9.	
Those Board of Directors are also responsible for 
overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Standalone Financial Statements
10.	 Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that 
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a 
high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that 
an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on 
Auditing will always detect a material misstatement

Financial statements
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or 
error and are considered material if, individually or in 
the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to 
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the 
basis of these financial statements.
11.	 As part of an audit in accordance with Standards on 
Auditing, specified under section 143(10) of the Act 
we exercise professional judgment and maintain 
professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
•	 Identify and assess the risks of material 
misstatement of the financial statements, whether 
due to fraud or error, design and perform audit 
procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain 
audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate 
to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not 
detecting a material misstatement resulting from 
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as 
fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of 
internal control;
•	 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant 
to the audit in order to design audit procedures that 
are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 
143(3)(i) of the Act we are also responsible for 
expressing our opinion on whether the Company has 
adequate internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements in place and the operating 
effectiveness of such controls;
•	 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting 
policies used and the reasonableness of 
accounting estimates and related disclosures made 
by management;
•	 Conclude on the appropriateness of Board of 
Directors’ use of the going concern basis of 
accounting and, based on the audit evidence 
obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists 
related to events or conditions that may cast 
significant doubt on the Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern. If we conclude that 
a material uncertainty exists, we are required to 
draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related 
disclosures in the financial statements or, if such 
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. 
Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence 
obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. 
However, future events or conditions may cause the 
Company to cease to continue as a going concern;
•	 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and 
content of the financial statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the financial statements 
represent the underlying transactions and events in 
a manner that achieves fair presentation;
12.	 We communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope 
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, 
including any significant deficiencies in internal control 
that we identify during our audit.
13.	 We also provide those charged with governance with 
a statement that we have complied with relevant 
ethical requirements regarding independence, and 
to communicate with them all relationships and 
other matters that may reasonably be thought to 
bear on our independence, and where applicable, 
related safeguards.
14.	 From the matters communicated with those charged 
with governance, we determine those matters that 
were of most significance in the audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and are therefore 
the key audit matters. We describe these matters 
in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation 
precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, 
in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that 
a matter should not be communicated in our report 
because the adverse consequences of doing so would 
reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest 
benefits of such communication.
Report on Other Legal and Regulatory 
Requirements
15.	 As required by section 197(16) of the Act based 
on our audit, we report that the Company has paid

In terms of the information and explanations sought by us 
and given by the Company and the books of account and 
records examined by us in the normal course of audit, and to 
the best of our knowledge and belief, we report that:
(i)	
(a)	
(A)	 The Company has maintained proper 
records showing full particulars, including 
quantitative details and situation of property, 
plant and equipment and right of use assets.
	
	
(B)	 The Company has maintained proper records 
showing full particulars of intangible assets.
	
(b)	 The Company has a regular programme of 
physical verification of its property, plant and 
equipment and right of use assets under which 
the assets are physically verified in a phased 
manner over a period of two years, which in our 
opinion, is reasonable having regard to the size 
of the Company and the nature of its assets. In 
accordance with this programme, certain property, 
plant and equipment and right of use assets 
were verified during the year and no material 
discrepancies were noticed on such verification.
	
(c)	
The title deeds of all the immovable properties held by the Company (other than properties where the Company 
is the lessee and the lease agreements are duly executed in favour of the lessee) disclosed in note 3.1 to the 
standalone financial statements are held in the name of the Company, except for the following properties 
which were transferred as a result of merger of companies wherein the title deeds are in the name of the

made thereunder.
(ii)	 (a)	
The management has conducted physical 
verification of inventory at reasonable intervals 
during the year, except for inventory-in-transit and 
inventory lying with third parties. In our opinion, 
the coverage and procedure of such verification 
by the management is appropriate and no 
discrepancies of 10% or more in the aggregate for 
each class of inventory were noticed as compared 
to book records. In respect of inventory lying 
with third parties, these have substantially been 
confirmed by the third parties.
	
(b)	 As disclosed in note 12 to the standalone

sanctioned a working capital limit in excess of 
`5 crore, by banks and financial institutions. 
Pursuant to the terms of the sanction letters,

Financial statements
1.	
In conjunction with our audit of the standalone financial 
statements of Schaeffler India Limited (‘the Company’) 
as at and for the year ended December 31, 2023, 
we have audited the internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements of the Company as at 
that date.
Responsibilities of Management and Those 
Charged with Governance for Internal 
Financial Controls
2.	
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible 
for establishing and maintaining internal financial 
controls based on the internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements criteria established 
by the Company considering the essential components 
of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on 
Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial 
Reporting (‘the Guidance Note’) issued by the Institute 
of Chartered Accountants of India (‘ICAI’). These 
responsibilities include the design, implementation 
and maintenance of adequate internal financial 
controls that were operating effectively for ensuring 
the orderly and efficient conduct of the Company’s 
business, including adherence to the Company’s 
policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention 
and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and 
completeness of the accounting records, and the 
timely preparation of reliable financial information, as 
required under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the 
Internal Financial Controls with Reference to 
Financial Statements
3.	
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the 
Company’s internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements based on our audit. We conducted 
our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing 
issued by the ICAI prescribed under Section 143(10) 
of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of 
internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements, and the Guidance Note issued by the ICAI. 
Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that 
we comply with ethical requirements and plan and 
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether adequate internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements were established and 
maintained and if such controls operated effectively in 
all material respects.
4.	
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain 
audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements 
and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements 
includes obtaining an understanding of such internal 
financial controls, assessing the risk that a material 
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design 
and operating effectiveness of internal control based 
on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend 
on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment 
of the risks of material misstatement of the financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error.
5.	
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our audit opinion on the Company’s internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with 
Reference to Standalone Financial Statements
6.	
A company’s internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements is a process designed to 
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability 
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial 
statements for external purposes in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s 
internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements include those policies and procedures 
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, 
in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect 
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of 
the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that 
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit 
preparation of financial statements in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles, and 
that receipts and expenditures of the company are 
being made only in accordance with authorisations of 
management and directors of the company; and (3) 
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or 
timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or 
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a 
material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial 
Controls with Reference to Standalone 
Financial Statements
7.	
Because of the inherent limitations of internal 
financial controls with reference to financial 
statements, including the possibility of collusion or 
Annexure B
Independent Auditor’s Report on the internal financial controls with reference to the standalone financial statements 
under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (‘the Act’)
improper management override of controls, material 
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not 
be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the 
internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements to future periods are subject to the risk that 
the internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements may become inadequate because of 
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance 
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
8.	
In our opinion, the Company has, in all material 
respects, adequate internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements and such controls 
were operating effectively as at December 31, 2023, 
based on the internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements criteria established by the 
Company considering the essential components of 
internal control stated in the Guidance Note issued by 
the ICAI.

2	
Basis of preparation and significant 
accounting policies
2.1	Basis of preparation
	
(i)	
These financial statements of Schaeffler India 
Limited (‘the Company’) have been prepared in 
accordance with Indian Accounting Standards as 
per the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 
Rules, 2015 as amended and notified under 
Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (the ‘Act’) 
and other relevant provisions of the Act.
	
	
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation 
of these financial statements are consistent for all 
the periods presented.
	
	
The financial statements are presented in Indian 
Rupees, which is the Company’s functional 
currency and all values are rounded off to the 
nearest million with one decimal place, except 
when otherwise indicated.
	
(ii)	 The financial statements have been prepared 
on a historical cost convention basis, except for 
the following:
•	 certain financial assets and liabilities (including 
derivatives) that are measured at fair value;
•	 defined benefit plans - net defined benefit 
(asset) / liabilities – Fair value of plan assets 
less present value of defined benefit obligation.
2.2	Current and non-current classification
	
All assets and liabilities have been classified as current 
or non-current as per the Company’s normal operating 
cycle and other criteria set out in Schedule III of the 
Act. Based on the nature of the products and time 
taken between acquisition of assets for processing 
and their realisation in cash and cash equivalents, the 
Company has ascertained its normal operating cycle as 
twelve months for the purpose of current or non-current 
classification of assets and liabilities.
	
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities 
are classified as non-current assets and non-
current liabilities.
2.3	Significant accounting judgments, 
estimates and assumptions
	
The preparation of financial statements in conformity 
with Ind AS requires the Company’s management 
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the 
reported amounts of revenue, expenses, assets 
and liabilities. Actual results could differ from 
those estimates.
	
Estimates and judgments are reviewed on an ongoing 
basis. They are based on historical experience and 
other factors, including expectations of future events 
that may have a financial impact on the Company 
and that are believed to be reasonable under the 
circumstance. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the period in which the estimates are 
revised and future periods are affected.
	
The key assumptions concerning the future and 
other key sources of estimating uncertainty at the 
reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing 
a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are 
described below:
	
a)	
Impairment of assets
	
	
The evaluation of applicability of indicators of 
impairment of assets requires assessment of 
external factors (significant decline in asset’s 
value, significant changes in the technological, 
market, economic or legal environment, 
market interest rates etc.) and internal factors 
(obsolescence or physical damage of an asset, 
poor economic performance of the asset etc.) 
which could result in significant change in 
recoverable amount of the assets.

b)	
Determination of the estimated useful lives
	
	
The Company uses its technical expertise along 
with historical and industry trends for determining 
the economic life of an asset/component 
of an asset. The useful lives are reviewed 
by management periodically and revised, if 
appropriate. In case of a revision, the unamortised 
depreciable amount is charged over the remaining 
useful life of the assets.
	
c)	
Current and deferred taxes
	
	
Significant management judgment is required to 
determine the amount of current and deferred 
taxes that can be recognised, based upon the 
likely timing and the level of future taxable profits 
together with future tax planning strategies.
	
d)	
Employee benefits
	
	
Management’s estimate of the Company’s 
obligation is determined based on actuarial 
valuation. An actuarial valuation involves making 
various assumptions that may differ from actual 
developments in the future. These include 
the determination of the discount rate, future 
salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the 
complexities involved in the valuation and its long-
term nature, these liabilities are highly sensitive 
to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions 
are reviewed at each reporting date.
	
	
The parameter most subject to change is the 
discount rate. In determining the appropriate 
discount rate for plans operated in India, the 
Company’s management considers the interest 
rates of Government bonds. Future salary 
increases and gratuity increases are based on 
expected future inflation rates for India.
	
	
Refer Note 42 for details of the key assumptions 
used in determining the accounting of these plans.
	
e)	
Provision for inventory obsolesce
	
	
The inventories are valued at lower of cost and 
net realisable value after providing for cost of 
obsolescence wherever considered necessary. 
Estimates of net realisable value are based on the 
most reliable evidence available at the time the 
estimates are made, of the amount the inventories 
are expected to realise. These estimates take into 
consideration fluctuations of price or cost directly 
relating to events occurring after the end of the 
period to the extent that such events confirm 
conditions existing at the end of the period.
2.4	Property, Plant and Equipment and 
intangible
	
Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) are stated at 
cost of acquisition or construction (including directly 
attributable expenses thereto), net of impairment loss 
if any, less depreciation / amortisation. Cost includes 
financing costs of borrowed funds attributable to 
acquisition or construction of qualifying fixed assets, 
up to the date the assets are put to use.
	
If significant parts of an item of PPE have different 
useful lives, then they are accounted for as separate 
items (major components) of PPE.
	
Capital work in progress is carried at cost, less any 
recognised impairment loss. Depreciation of these 
assets commences when the assets are substantially 
ready for their intended use. Advances given towards 
acquisition or construction of PPE outstanding at each 
reporting date are disclosed as Capital Advances under 
“Other non-current Assets”.
	
An item of PPE is de-recognised upon disposal or when 
no future economic benefits are expected to arise 
from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss 
arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of PPE 
is determined as the difference between the sales 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is 
recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
Cost of assets not ready for intended use, as on 
the reporting date, is shown under capital work-in-
progress. Advances given towards acquisition of 
property, plant and equipment outstanding as at 
reporting date are disclosed as “other non-current 
assets”.
	
Intangible assets are initially recognised at cost.
	
Intangible assets with definite useful lives are 
amortised on a straight line basis so as to reflect 
the pattern in which the asset’s economic benefits 
are consumed.
	
Expenditure pertaining to research is expensed 
out as and when incurred. Expenditure incurred on 
development is capitalized if such expenditure leads 
to creation of an asset, otherwise such expenditure is 
charged to the statement of profit and loss.
	
Depreciation / amortization
	
(i)	
Leasehold land is amortised over the period 
of lease using straight-line method (SLM) and 
included in depreciation and amortization in 
statement of profit and loss statement.
	
	
Useful lives are reviewed by the Company’s 
management at each reporting date and revised, 
if appropriate.
	
(ii)	 The useful lives have been assessed based on 
technical advice, taking into account the nature 
of the PPE and the estimated usage of the asset 
on the basis of management’s best estimation 
of obtaining economic benefits from those 
classes of assets. The estimated useful life is 
reviewed periodically, with the effect of any 
changes in estimate being accounted for on a 
prospective basis.
Such classes of assets and their estimated useful 
lives are as under:
No

Buildings
25-30 Years
2
Plant and equipments
3-8 Years
3

4

5 Years
5
Vehicles

6
Software

(iii)	 Depreciation on additions / deletions to PPE 
during the year is provided on pro-rata basis with 
reference to the date of additions/deletions except 
low value of items costing 
INR 5,000 or less which are fully depreciated in the 
year when the assets are put to use.
	
(iv)	 Depreciation on subsequent expenditure on PPE 
arising on account of capital improvement or other 
factors is provided for prospectively over the 
remaining useful life.
	
(v)	
Intangible assets (software) are recorded at its 
acquisition price and amortized on the straight-
line method over a period of three years.
2.5	Leases
	
Effective 1 January 2020, the Company has adopted 
Ind AS 116 Leases which introduces single accounting 
model and requires a lessee to recognize assets 
and liabilities for all leases subject to recognition 
exemptions. The Company adopted Ind AS 116 Leases 
using modified retrospective approach.
	
Company as a lessee
	
The Company’s lease asset classes primarily consist of 
leases for land and buildings. The Company applies a 
single recognition and measurement approach for all 
leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low-
value assets. The Company recognizes lease liabilities 
to make lease payments and right-of-use assets 
representing the right to use the underlying assets.
	
Right-of-use assets
	
The Company recognizes right-of-use assets at the 
commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the 
underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use 
assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted 
for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost 
of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease 
liabilities recognized, initial direct costs incurred, and 
lease payments made at or before the commencement 
date less any lease incentives received. Right-of-use 
assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over 
the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful 
lives of the assets. The useful life of Right-of-use assets 
varies from 2 to 10 years.
	
Lease liabilities
	
At the commencement date of the lease, the Company 
recognizes lease liabilities measured at the present 
value of lease payments to be made over the lease 
term. The lease payments include fixed payments 
(including in substance fixed payments) less any lease 
incentives receivable, variable lease payments that 
depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to 
be paid under residual value guarantees.
	
The lease payments also include the exercise price of a 
purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by 
the Company and payments of penalties for terminating 
the lease, if the lease term reflects the Company 
exercising the option to terminate. Variable lease 
payments that do not depend on an index or a rate 
are recognized as expenses in the period in which the 
event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.
	
In calculating the present value of lease payments, the 
Company uses the interest rate implicit in the lease 
or, if not readily determinable, using the incremental 
borrowing rates in the country of domicile of the leases. 
After the commencement date, the amount of lease 
liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest 
and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, 
the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured

The Company applies the short-term lease recognition 
exemption to its short-term leases (i.e., those leases 
that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the 
commencement date and do not contain a purchase 
option). It also applies the lease of low-value assets 
recognition exemption to leases of office equipment 
that are considered to be low value. Lease payments on 
short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are 
recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the 
lease term.
	
Company as a lessor
	
Leases in which the Company does not transfer 
substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to 
ownership of an asset is classified as operating leases. 
Rental income arising is accounted for on a straight-line 
basis over the lease terms. Initial direct costs incurred 
in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are 
added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and 
recognized over the lease term on the same basis as 
rental income. Contingent rents are recognized as 
revenue in the period in which they are earned.
2.6	Impairment of non-financial assets
	
The carrying amounts of assets are reviewed at each 
reporting date to determine if there is any indication 
of impairment based on internal/external factors. 
Assessment of indication of impairment of an asset is 
made at the year end. An impairment loss is recognized 
wherever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its 
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the 
greater of the asset’s net selling price and value in use. 
In assessing value in use, the Company measures its 
‘value in use’ on the basis of estimated discounted 
cash flows of projections based on current prices. 
After impairment, depreciation is provided on the 
revised carrying amount of the asset over its remaining 
useful life.
	
When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the 
carrying amount of the asset or a cash-generating unit 
is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable 
amount, so that the increased carrying amount does 
not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined had no impairment loss been recognised 
for the asset earlier.
2.7	Assets classified as held for sale
	
Assets classified as held for sale (including liabilities 
directly associated with those assets held for sales) 
that are available for immediate sale and where the 
sale is highly probable of being completed within one 
year from the date of classification are considered and 
classified as assets held for sale. Assets held for sale 
are measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair 
value less costs to sell except financial assets within 
the scope of Ind AS 109 - Financial Instruments. The 
determination of fair value less costs to sell includes 
use of management estimates and assumptions. The 
fair value of asset held for sale has been estimated 
using observable inputs such as price quotations.
2.8	Inventories
	
Inventories comprise of all costs of purchase, 
conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the 
inventories to their present location and condition.
	
Raw materials are valued at the lower of cost and net 
realisable value. Cost is ascertained on a moving 
weighted average basis, except for goods in transit 
which is ascertained on a specific identification basis.
	
Work-in-progress, finished goods and traded goods are 
carried at the lower of cost and net realizable value. 
Cost is determined on a weighted average basis. In 
case of work-in-progress and manufactured finished 
goods, cost includes material, labour and production 
overheads. Fixed production overheads are allocated 
on the basis of normal capacity of production facilities.
	
Net realisable value of work-in-progress and finished 
goods is determined with reference to the estimated 
selling price less estimated cost of completion and 
estimated costs necessary to make the sale of related 
finished goods as applicable.
	
Stores, spares and tools other than obsolete and slow-
moving items are carried at cost.
2.9	Foreign currency transactions
	
Initial recognition
	
Foreign currency transactions are translated in the 
functional currency, by applying to the foreign currency 
amount, the exchange rate between functional 
currency and foreign currency prevailing at the date 
of transaction.
	
Conversion
	
Foreign currency monetary items as at reporting date 
are translated using the closing exchange rate on 
that date.
	
Exchange differences
	
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from 
the settlement of such transactions and from 
the translation of monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at the year end 
exchange rates are recognised in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss in the year in which they arise, except 
exchange differences arising from the translation 
of qualifying cash flow hedge to the extent that the 
hedges are effective, which are recognized in Other 
Comprehensive Income (OCI).
2.10 Revenue recognition
	
Revenue from sale of goods is recognised when control 
of the goods or services are transferred to the customer 
at an amount that reflects the consideration to which 
the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for 
those goods. Company recognized revenue at a point-
in-time. The point-in-time is determined when the 
control of the goods or services is transferred which 
is generally determined based on when the signiﬁcant 
risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the 
customer. Apart from this, the Company also considers 
its present right to payment, the legal title to the goods, 
the physical possession and the customer acceptance 
in determining the point in time where control has been 
transferred. The Company assesses promises in the 
contract that are separate performance obligations to 
which a portion of transaction price is allocated.
	
In determining the transaction price, the Company 
considers below, if any:
	
Variable consideration
	
This includes discounts, incentives, volume rebates, 
etc. It is estimated at contract inception and 
constrained until it is highly probable that a significant 
revenue reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue 
recognized will not occur when the associated 
uncertainty with the variable consideration is 
subsequently resolved. It is reassessed at end of each 
reporting period.
	
Contract balances
	
Trade receivables: A receivable represents the 
Company’s right to an amount of consideration that is 
unconditional i.e. only the passage of time is required 
before payment of consideration is due.
	
Contract assets: Contract assets recognised in 
accordance with Ind AS 115, effective from 1 January 
2021, shall be amortise on systematic basis that is in 
consistence with the transfer to customer with goods or 
services to which assets relates.
	
Contract liabilities: A contract liability is the obligation 
to transfer goods or services to a customer for which 
the Company has received consideration (or an amount 
of consideration is due) from the customer. Contract 
liabilities are recognised as revenue when the Company 
performs under the contract.
	
Significant payment terms
	
Generally, the Company provides credit period ranging 
from 60 to 75 days.
	
Interest income
	
Interest income from a financial asset is recognised 
when it is probable that the economic benefits will 
flow to the Company and the amount of income can be 
measured reliably. Interest income is accrued on a time 
basis, by reference to the amortised cost and at the 
effective interest rate applicable.
2.11 Employee benefits
	
a)	
Short term employee benefits
	
	
Employee benefits payable wholly within twelve 
months of rendering the service are classified 
as short-term employee benefits and are 
recognised in the period in which the employee 
renders the related service and comprises part of 
compensated absences paid on annual basis.
	
b)	
Post-employment benefits
	
	
Defined benefit plans
	
	
All employees are covered under Employees’ 
Group Gratuity Scheme, which is a defined 
benefit plan. The Company contributes to a fund 
maintained with Life Insurance Company (LIC) 
on the basis of the year end liability determined 
based on actuarial valuation using the Projected 
Unit Cost Method. Remeasurements of the net 
defined benefit liability, which comprise actuarial 
gains/losses, return on plan assets (excluding 
interest) and the effect of asset ceiling (if any, 
excluding interest) are recognized in Other 
Comprehensive Income. Net interest expense and

Defined contribution plans
	
	
All other employees are covered under 
contributory provident fund benefit of specific 
percentage contribution of basic salary. Certain 
employees are also covered by a Company 
managed superannuation fund. Both are defined 
contribution schemes and the contributions are 
charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss of the 
year, when the contributions to the respective 
funds are due. There are no obligations other than 
the contributions payable to the respective funds.
	
	
Long-term employee benefits
	
	
Provision for long-term employee benefits 
comprise of compensated absences. These are 
measured on the basis of year end actuarial 
valuation in line with the Company’s rules for 
compensated absences. Remeasurement gains or 
losses are recognized in statement of profit and 
loss in the period in which they arise.
2.12 Financial instruments
	
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to 
a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or 
equity instrument of another entity.
	
Financial assets
	
Initial recognition and measurement
	
Financial assets are recognized initially at fair value. 
Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the 
acquisition of financial assets (other than financial 
assets not recorded at fair value through profit 
and loss) are added to the fair value of financial 
assets. Transaction costs directly attributable to the 
acquisition of financial assets at fair value through 
profit and loss are recognised immediately in Statement 
of Profit and Loss.
	
With the exception of trade receivables, the Company 
initially measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, 
in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through 
profit or loss, transaction costs. Trade receivables that 
do not contain a significant financing component or for 
which the Company has applied the practical expedient 
are measured at the transaction price as disclosed 
under Revenue recognition policy.
	
Subsequent measurement
	
For the purposes of subsequent measurement, financial 
assets are classified into below categories:
•	 Financial assets at amortized cost;
•	 Financial assets including derivatives at fair value 
through profit or loss (FVTPL)
•	 Financial assets at fair value through other 
comprehensive income (FVTOCI)
	
Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to 
their initial recognition, except if and in the period the 
Company changes its business model for managing 
financial assets.
	
(i)	
Financial assets at amortized cost
	
	
Financial assets are subsequently measured at 
amortized cost if it meets both of the following 
conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:
•	 the financial asset is held within a business 
where the objective is to hold these assets in 
order to collect contractual cash flows; and
•	 the contractual terms of the financial asset give 
rise on specified dates to cash flows that are 
solely payments of principal and interest on the 
principal amount outstanding.
	
	
After initial measurement, such financial assets 
are subsequently measured at amortized cost 
using the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method. 
Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account 
any discount or premium on acquisition and fees 
or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR 
amortization is included in the Statement of Profit 
and Loss. The losses arising from impairment are 
recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. 
This category generally applies to trade and other 
receivables, loans and other financial assets.
	
(ii)	 Financial assets including derivatives at fair value 
through profit or loss (FVTPL)
	
	
Financial assets are measured at fair value 
through profit or loss unless it is measured at 
amortized cost or at fair value through other 
comprehensive income on initial recognition. 
The transaction costs directly attributable to the 
acquisition of financial assets at fair value through 
profit or loss are immediately recognized in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
(iii)	 Financial assets at fair value through other 
comprehensive income (FVTOCI)
	
	
Financial assets are measured at fair value through 
Other Comprehensive Income if these financial 
assets are held within a business whose objective 
is achieved by both collecting contractual cash 
flows and selling financial assets and contractual 
terms of the financial asset give rise to cash flows 
on specified dates that are solely payments of 
principal and interest on the principal amount 
outstanding. Derivative instruments included in 
FVTOCI category are measured initially as well as at 
each reporting date at fair value. Movement in fair 
value is recognized in OCI.
	
Derecognition
	
A financial asset is derecognized when the right to 
receive cash flows from the asset has expired or the 
Company has transferred its rights to receive cash 
flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to 
pay the received cash flows in full without material 
delay to a third party and the Company has transferred 
substantially all risks and rewards of the asset or has 
transferred control of the asset to a third party. On 
derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the 
differences between the carrying amounts at the date 
of derecognition and the consideration received is 
recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
Impairment of financial assets
	
The Company applies the expected credit loss (ECL) 
model for measurement and recognition of impairment 
losses on trade receivables or any other financial assets 
that result from transactions that are within the scope of 
“Ind AS 115 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers”. 
The Company follows the simplified approach for 
recognition of impairment loss allowance on receivables 
(net of advances). The application of the simplified 
approach does not require the Company to track changes 
in credit risk. As a practical expedient, the Company 
uses a provision matrix to determine impairment 
loss allowance on trade receivables. Impairment loss 
allowance (or reversal) during the period is recognized 
in the Statement of Profit and Loss. This amount is 
reflected under the head ‘Other expenses (or other 
income)’ in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
Financial liabilities
	
Initial recognition and measurement
	
Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, 
as measured at amortised cost or financial liabilities 
at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). A financial 
liability is classified as at FVTPL if it is classified as 
held for trading or is a derivative or it is designated as 
such on initial recognition. The Company’s financial 
liabilities include trade payables and other payables.
	
Equity instruments issued by the Company are 
classified as equity in accordance with the substance 
of the contractual arrangements and the definitions of 
a financial liability and an equity instrument. An equity 
instrument is any contract that evidences a residual 
interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of 
its liabilities.
	
Subsequent measurement
	
Financial liabilities, including derivatives, which are 
designated for measurement at FVTPL are subsequently 
measured at fair value. Other financial liabilities such 
as deposits are measured at amortised cost using 
Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method.
	
Derecognition
	
A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation 
under the liability is discharged or cancelled or 
expired. When an existing financial liability is replaced 
by another from the same lender on substantially 
different terms, or the terms of an existing liability 
are substantially modified, such an exchange or 
modification is treated as the derecognition of the 
original liability and the recognition of a new liability. 
The difference in the respective carrying amounts is 
recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
Offsetting of financial instruments
	
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset 
and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet if 
there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the 
recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle 
on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the 
liabilities simultaneously.
	
Derivative instruments
	
The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts 
to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency 
fluctuations relating to highly probable and forecast 
transactions. These forward contracts are stated at fair 
value at each reporting date. Changes in the fair value 
of these forward contracts that are designated and 
effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised 
directly in cash flow hedge reserve under OCI, net 
of taxes and the ineffective portion is recognised 
immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

Amounts accumulated in cash flow hedge reserve 
are reclassified to Surplus (Profit and loss balance) 
in the same period during which the forecasted 
transaction occurs.
	
Hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively 
when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, 
terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for 
hedge accounting. For forecasted transactions, any 
cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument 
recognised in cash flow hedge reserve is retained until 
the forecasted transaction occurs. If the forecasted 
transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net 
cumulative gain or loss recognised in cash flow hedge 
reserve is immediately transferred to the Statement of 
Profit and Loss for the period.
2.13 Income and deferred taxes
	
Tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. 
Current income tax is measured at the amount expected 
to be paid to the tax authorities in accordance with 
the provisions of the Indian Income Tax Act, 1961. 
Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on 
temporary differences between the tax base of assets 
and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial 
reporting purposes at the reporting date.
	
Deferred tax is measured based on the tax rates and tax 
laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all 
taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are 
recognized for all deductible temporary differences, the 
carry forward of unused tax credits and any unused tax 
losses. Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent 
that it is probable that taxable profit will be available 
against which the deductible temporary differences, 
and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused 
tax losses can be utilized.
	
Deferred tax relating to items recognized outside 
Statement of Profit and Loss is recognized outside 
Statement of Profit and Loss. Deferred tax items are 
recognized in correlation to the underlying transaction 
either in Other Comprehensive Income or directly 
in Equity.
	
At each reporting date, the Company reassesses 
unrecognized deferred tax assets. It recognises 
unrecognized deferred tax assets to the extent that 
it has become probable that sufficient future taxable 
income will be available against which such deferred 
tax assets can be realised.
2.14 Investment in subsidiaries
	
Investment in subsidiaries, associates and joint venture 
is carried at cost. Refer note 2.6 above for impairment 
of non-financial assets.
2.15 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and 
Contingent Assets
	
Provisions are recognized when the Company has a 
present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of 
past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources 
will be required to settle the obligation and in respect 
of which a reliable estimate can be made of the 
amount of obligation. Provisions are not discounted 
to its present value and are determined based on 
best estimates required to settle the obligation at the 
reporting date. These are reviewed at each reporting 
date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimates.
	
A disclosure by way of a contingent liability is made 
when there is a possible obligation or a present 
obligation that may, but probably will not, require 
an outflow of resources. Contingent assets are not 
recognised or disclosed in the financial statements.
2.16 Warranties
	
Provisions for the expected cost of warranty obligations 
are recognised at the time of sale of the relevant 
products, at the best estimate of the expenditure 
required to settle the Company’s obligation.
2.17 Earnings per share
	
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the 
net profit or loss for the year attributable to equity 
shareholders, by the weighted average number of 
equity shares outstanding during the period.
	
Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing 
the net profit or loss for the year attributable to 
the equity shareholders, by the weighted average 
number of equity and equivalent diluted equity shares 
outstanding during the year except where the results 
would be antidilutive.
2.18 Cash and cash equivalents
	
Cash and cash equivalents include cheques in hand, 
cash at bank and deposits with banks having original 
maturity of not more than three months.
2.19 Fair value measurement
	
The Company’s accounting policies and disclosures 
require the measurement of fair values for both 
financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. Fair 
value is the price that would be received to sell an asset 
or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the measurement date. 
The Company has an established control framework 
with respect to the measurement of fair values. The 
Company’s management regularly reviews significant 
unobservable inputs and valuation adjustments. If 
third party information is used to measure fair values, 
then the Company’s management assesses the 
evidence obtained from the third parties to support the 
conclusion that such valuations meet the requirements 
of Ind AS, including the level in the fair value hierarchy 
in which such valuations should be classified.
	
When measuring the fair value of a financial asset or a 
financial liability, the Company uses observable market 
data as far as possible. Fair values are categorized into 
different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the 
inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows:
	
Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets 
for identical assets or liabilities.
	
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included in 
Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, 
either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived 
from prices).
	
Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not 
based on observable market data (unobservable 
inputs).
	
If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an 
asset or a liability fall into different levels of the fair 
value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is 
categorized in its entirety in the same level of the 
fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is 
significant to the entire measurement.
	
The Company recognises transfers between levels 
of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting 
period during which the change has occurred. In 
determining the fair value of its financial instruments, 
the Company uses a variety of methods and 
assumptions that are based on market conditions and 
risks existing at each reporting date. The methods used 
to determine fair value includes discounted cash flow 
analysis, available quoted market prices and dealer 
quotes. All methods of assessing fair value result from 
general approximation of value and the same may differ 
from the actual realised value. Further information 
about the assumptions made in measuring fair value is 
included in the Note 2.12 on financial instruments
2.20 Segment Reporting - Identification of 
Segments:
	
An operating segment is a component of the Company 
that engages in business activities from which it may 
earn revenues and incur expenses, whose operating 
results are regularly reviewed by the company’s Chief 
Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) to make decisions 
for which discrete financial information is available. 
Based on the management approach as defined 
in Ind AS 108, the CODM evaluates the Company’s 
performance and allocates resources based on an 
analysis of various performance indicators by business 
segments and geographic segments.
2.21 Business combinations
	
As part of its transition to Ind AS, the Company elected 
to apply “Ind AS 103 - Business Combinations”, to 
only those business combinations that occurred on 
or after the date of transition to Ind AS i.e. January 1, 
2016. Business combinations arising from transfers of 
interests in entities that are under the common control 
of the shareholder that controls the Company are 
accounted for as if the acquisition had occurred at the 
beginning of the earliest comparative period presented 
or, if later, at the date that common control was 
established; for this purpose comparatives are revised. 
The assets and liabilities acquired are recognised at 
their carrying amounts. The identity of the reserves is 
preserved as they appear in the financial statements of 
the Company in the same form in which they appeared 
in the financial statements of the acquired entities. 
The difference, if any, between the consideration and 
the amount of share capital of the acquired entities 
is treated as capital reserve. Transaction costs are 
expensed as they are incurred in respective periods.
2.22 Exceptional items
	
When items of income and expense within statement of 
profit or loss from ordinary activities are of such size, 
nature or incidence that their disclosure is relevant 
to explain the performance of the enterprise for the 
period, the nature and amount of such material items 
are disclosed separately as exceptional items.
2.23 Recent accounting pronouncements
	
Standards issued but not yet effective
	
Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new 
standard or amendments to the existing standards. 
There is no such notification which would have been 
applicable from January 1, 2024.

40.	Financial risk management
The Company has exposure to the following risks arising from financial instruments:
•	 market risk [refer 40 (A) below]
•	 liquidity risk [refer 40 (B) below]
•	 credit risk [refer 40 (C) below]
In the course of its business, the Company is exposed primarily to aforesaid risks, which may impact the fair value of its 
financial instruments. The Company has a risk management system which not only covers the foreign exchange risks but 
also other risks associated with the financial assets and liabilities such as credit risks. The risk management strategy is 
approved by Board of Directors which is implemented by the Company’s management. The risk management framework 
aims to create a stable business planning environment by reducing the impact of market related risks, credit risks and 
currency fluctuations on the Company’s earnings. The risks identified through the risk management system are analysed and 
evaluated by the Company’s management and reported to the Board of Directors periodically along with report of planned 
mitigation measures.
A)	 Market risk
	
Market risk is the risk of any loss in future earnings, in realizable fair values or in future cash flows that may result from 
a change in the price of a financial instrument. The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in 
the foreign currency exchange rates, liquidity and other market changes. Future specific market movements cannot be 
normally predicted with reasonable accuracy.
	
(i)	
Foreign currency risk
	
	
The Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from foreign currency transactions, primarily with respect 
to the US Dollars and Euro. Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions and recognised 
assets and liabilities denominated in a currency that is not the Company’s functional currency (Indian Rupees).
	
	
The Company has import and export transactions in foreign currencies. Imports are higher than exports and hence 
the Company has foreign currency exposure to the extent of imports being higher than exports. The risk of foreign 
currency fluctuation is mitigated through hedging. Please refer Note 39 for details of foreign currency exposure.
	
	
The Company’s exposure to foreign currency risk at the end of reporting period are as follows:
	
	
Foreign Currency Sensitivity

(ii)	 Interest rate risk
	
	
Interest rate risk exposure: The Company does not have interest bearing borrowings and interest rate risk is 
towards opportunity cost on investment in tax free bonds. Surplus funds are being invested in bank deposits at 
fixed interest rates and the tenure is managed to match with the Company’s liquidity profile.
B)	 Liquidity risk
	
The Company’s principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents and cash flows generated from operations. 
The Company regularly monitors actual cash flows and forecasts to ensure that the Company maintains sufficient 
liquidity to meet the operation needs.
	
The following table shows the maturity analysis of the Company’s financial liabilities based on contractually agreed 
undiscounted cash flows (except lease liabilities refer Note 49) at the balance sheet date:

obligations in entirety and timely. The Company is exposed to credit risks arising from it’s operating and financing

sector enterprises and reputed private corporates. For trade receivables, the Company computes expected credit loss

observed overdue rate over expected life of trade receivables ranging from 0.04% to 0.78%, except for few customer 
where specific provisions is being created. The expected credit loss allowance is considered as a percentage of net

Characteristics of defined benefit plans and risks associated with them:
	
Valuations of defined benefit plan are performed on certain basic set of pre-determined assumptions and other 
regulatory framework which may vary over time. Thus, the Company is exposed to various risks in providing the above 
benefit plans which are as follows:
	
(i)	
Interest Rate risk: The plan exposes the Company to the risk of fall in interest rates. A fall in interest rates will 
result in an increase in the ultimate cost of providing the above benefit and will thus result in an increase in the 
value of the liability (i.e. value of defined benefit obligation).
	
(ii)	 Salary Escalation Risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan is calculated with the assumption of salary 
increase rate of plan participants in future. Deviation in the rate of increase of salary in future for plan participants 
from the rate of increase in salary used to determine the present value of obligation will have a bearing on the 
plan’s liability.
	
(iii)	 Demographic Risk: The Company has used certain mortality and attrition assumptions in valuation of the liability. 
The Company is exposed to the risk of actual experience turning out to be worse compared to the assumption.
	
(iv)	 Investment Risk: The Company has funded with well established Govt. of India undertaking & other IRDA approved 
agency and therefore, there is no material investment risk.

Independent Auditor’s Report
To the Members of Schaeffler India Limited
Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Opinion
1.	
We have audited the accompanying consolidated 
financial statements of Schaeffler India Limited (‘the 
Holding Company’) and its subsidiary, KRSV Innovative 
Auto Solutions Private Limited (the Holding Company 
and its subsidiary together referred to as ‘the Group’), 
which comprise the Consolidated Balance Sheet as 
at 31 December 2023, the Consolidated Statement 
of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive 
Income), the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement and 
the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity for 
the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated 
financial statements, including a summary of 
the significant accounting policies and other 
explanatory information.
2.	
In our opinion and to the best of our information and 
according to the explanations given to us and based 
on the consideration of the report of the other auditor 
on separate financial statement and on the other 
financial information of the subsidiary, the aforesaid 
consolidated financial statements give the information 
required by the Companies Act, 2013 (‘the Act’) in 
the manner so required and give a true and fair view 
in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards 
(‘Ind AS’) specified under section 133 of the Act, read 
with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 
Rules, 2015, and other accounting principles generally 
accepted in India of the consolidated state of affairs 
of the Group, as at 31 December 2023, and their 
consolidated profit (including other comprehensive 
income), consolidated cash flows and the consolidated 
changes in equity for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
3.	
We conducted our audit in accordance with the 
Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) 
of the Act. Our responsibilities under those standards 
are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities 
for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements 
section of our report. We are independent of the 
Group, in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued 
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India 
(‘ICAI’) together with the ethical requirements that 
are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements under the provisions of the Act and the 
rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements 
and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit 
evidence we have obtained together with the audit 
evidence obtained by the other auditor in terms of their 
report referred to in paragraph 14 of the Other Matter 
section below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our opinion.
Key Audit Matters
4.	
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment and based on the consideration of the report 
of the other auditor on separate financial statement of the subsidiary, were of most significance in our audit of the 
consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of 
the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate 
opinion on these matters.
Key audit matter
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Revenue Recognition
(refer note 23 and 46 of the accompanying consolidated financial 
statements)
The Group’s revenue principally comprises sale of goods. Revenue 
from the sale of goods is recognised at point in time when the 
control of the goods is transferred to the customers, which is on 
dispatch/delivery in accordance with the terms of sales contracts.
We have identified the recognition of revenue as a key audit 
matter since the Group has various customers with different terms 
of trade which increase the risk of error in the timing of revenue 
recognition. Revenue is determined to be an area involving 
significant risk in line with the requirements on Standards of 
Auditing and hence requiring significant auditor attention.
The Group and its external stakeholders focus on revenue as a 
key performance indicator and therefore there could be a risk 
of material misstatement in so far as revenue recognition is 
concerned.
Our key audit procedures around revenue recognition included, and not 
limited to, the following:
•	
Obtained an understanding of and assessed the design, 
implementation and operating effectiveness of management’s key 
internal financial controls in relation to revenue recognition;
•	
Assessed the appropriateness of the revenue recognition 
accounting policies of the Group including those relating to variable 
consideration, by evaluating compliance with the applicable 
accounting standards.
•	
Selected samples of revenue transactions during the year and 
inspected underlying customer contracts and shipping documents 
to identify the terms and conditions relating to the transfer of control 
of the products sold and assessed the Group’s timing of revenue 
recognition;
•	
Performed analytical review procedures on revenue recognized during 
the year to identify any unusual and/or material variances.
Key audit matter
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Considering the aforesaid significance to our audit and the 
external stakeholders, revenue recognition has been considered 
as a key audit matter for the current year’s audit.
•	
Tested selected samples of revenue transactions recorded before and 
after the financial year end date to determine whether the revenue has 
been recognised in the appropriate financial period.
Evaluated the appropriateness and adequacy of disclosures in the 
financial statements in respect of revenue recognition with the applicable 
standards
Related Party Transactions
(refer note 36 of the accompanying consolidated financial 
statements)
The Group has entered into several transactions with related 
parties during the year ended 31 December 2023 and has 
outstanding balances as the year-end.
The Group’s related party transactions comprises purchase and 
sale of goods, purchase of tangible assets, payments for royalty, 
information technology services and other services, guarantee 
commission and reimbursements.
Each related party operates under different jurisdiction and 
applies its own pricing model to be compliant with the respective 
legal and tax (transfer pricing) framework of the respective 
jurisdiction.
We have identified transactions with related parties as a key 
audit matter due to quantum of transactions, completeness of the 
disclosures made in the financial statements, compliance with 
various tax requirements and judgements involved to ensure arm’s 
length pricing, compliance with statutory regulations governing 
related party transactions such as Companies Act, 2013 and 
Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and 
Disclosure Requirements) Regulations 2015 (‘the SEBI listing 
regulations’).
Our key audit procedures around Related party transactions included, and 
not limited to, the following:
•	
Obtained an understanding and assessed the design, implementation 
and operating effectiveness of management’s key internal financial 
controls in relation to identification and disclosure of related party 
transactions and arm’s length assessment.
•	
Assessed the compliance with the SEBI listing regulations and the 
regulations under the Companies Act, 2013, including authorization 
and approvals as specified in Sections 177 and 188 of the Companies 
Act, 2013 with respect to the related party transactions, as applicable.
•	
Evaluated the compliance with Indian Transfer Pricing Regulations with 
respect to arm’s length based on the transfer pricing documentation 
prepared by the Group. This also involved obtaining views from the 
auditor’s internal tax experts regarding the arm’s length pricing.
•	
On a sample basis, inspected relevant ledgers, agreements and 
other information that may indicate the existence of related party 
relationships or transactions. We also assessed the completeness of 
related parties with reference to the various statutory registers and 
declarations maintained by the Group’s management.
Evaluated the adequacy and appropriateness of the disclosures on related 
party transactions in the financial statements with the requirements of the 
applicable accounting standard.

Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report

In connection with our audit of the consolidated

the other information is materially inconsistent 
with the consolidated financial statements or our 
knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears 
to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we 
have performed, we conclude that there is a material 
misstatement of this other information, we are required to 
report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of Management and 
Those Charged with Governance for the 
Consolidated Financial Statements
6.	
The accompanying consolidated financial statements 
have been approved by the Holding Company’s Board 
of Directors. The Holding Company’s Board of Directors 
are responsible for the matters stated in section 
134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation and

that give a true and fair view of the consolidated

appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and 
estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, 
implementation and maintenance of adequate internal 
financial controls, that were operating effectively 
for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the 
accounting records, relevant to the preparation and 
presentation of the financial statements that give a true 
and fair view and are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, which have been used for 
the purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial 
statements by the Board of Directors of the Holding 
Company, as aforesaid.
7.	
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, 
the respective Board of Directors of the companies 
included in the Group and of are responsible for 
assessing the ability of the Group and of to continue 
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters 
related to going concern and using the going concern 
basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either 
intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or 
has no realistic alternative but to do so.
8.	
Those respective Board of Directors are also 
responsible for overseeing the financial reporting 
process of the companies included in the Group.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements
9.	
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the consolidated financial statements as 
a whole are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report 
that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is 
a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that 
an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on 
Auditing will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or 
error and are considered material if, individually or in 
the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to 
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the 
basis of these consolidated financial statements.
10.	 As part of an audit in accordance with Standards on 
Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Act 
we exercise professional judgment and maintain 
professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
•	 Identify and assess the risks of material 
misstatement of the consolidated financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error, design 
and perform audit procedures responsive to those 
risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
The risk of not detecting a material misstatement 
resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting 
from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, 
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the 
override of internal control;
•	 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant 
to the audit in order to design audit procedures 
that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under 
section 143(3)(i) of the Act we are also responsible 
for expressing our opinion on whether the Holding 
Company has adequate internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements in place and 
the operating effectiveness of such controls;
•	 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting 
policies used and the reasonableness of 
accounting estimates and related disclosures made 
by management;
•	 Conclude on the appropriateness of Board of 
Directors’ use of the going concern basis of 
accounting and, based on the audit evidence 
obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists 
related to events or conditions that may cast 
significant doubt on the ability of the Group and to 
continue as a going concern. If we conclude that 
a material uncertainty exists, we are required to 
draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related 
disclosures in the financial statements or, if such 
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. 
Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence 
obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. 
However, future events or conditions may cause 
the Group and to cease to continue as a going 
concern; and
•	 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and 
content of the financial statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the financial statements 
represent the underlying transactions and events in 
a manner that achieves fair presentation.
•	 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding 
the financial statements of the entities or business 
activities within the Group, to express an opinion 
on the consolidated financial statements. We are 
responsible for the direction, supervision and 
performance of the audit of financial statements of 
such entities included in the financial statements, of 
which we are the independent auditors. For the other 
entity included in the financial statements, which have 
been audited by the other auditor, such other auditor 
remain responsible for the direction, supervision and 
performance of the audits carried out by them. We 
remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
11.	 We communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope 
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, 
including any significant deficiencies in internal control 
that we identify during our audit.
12.	 We also provide those charged with governance with 
a statement that we have complied with relevant 
ethical requirements regarding independence, and 
to communicate with them all relationships and 
other matters that may reasonably be thought to 
bear on our independence, and where applicable, 
related safeguards.
13.	 From the matters communicated with those charged 
with governance, we determine those matters that 
were of most significance in the audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and are therefore 
the key audit matters. We describe these matters 
in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation 
precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, 
in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that 
a matter should not be communicated in our report 
because the adverse consequences of doing so would 
reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest 
benefits of such communication.
Other Matter
14.	 We did not audit the financial statements one 
(1) subsidiary, whose financial statement reflect 
total assets of `184.7 million and net assets of 
` (64.8) million as at 31 December 2023, total revenues

Financial statements
1.	
In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated 
financial statements of Schaeffler India Limited (‘the 
Holding Company’) and its subsidiary (the Holding 
Company and its subsidiary together referred to as 
‘the Group’), as at and for the year ended 31 December 
2023, we have audited the internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements of the Holding 
Company and its subsidiary company, which are 
companies covered under the Act, as at that date.
Responsibilities of Management and Those 
Charged with Governance for Internal 
Financial Controls
2.	
The respective Board of Directors of the Holding 
Company and its subsidiary company, which are 
companies covered under the Act, are responsible 
for establishing and maintaining internal financial 
controls based on the internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements criteria established 
by the Company considering the essential components 
of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on 
Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial 
Reporting (‘the Guidance Note’) issued by the Institute 
of Chartered Accountants of India (‘ICAI’). These 
responsibilities include the design, implementation 
and maintenance of adequate internal financial 
controls that were operating effectively for ensuring 
the orderly and efficient conduct of the Company’s 
business, including adherence to the Company’s 
policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention 
and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and 
completeness of the accounting records, and the 
timely preparation of reliable financial information, as 
required under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the 
Internal Financial Controls with Reference to 
Consolidated Financial Statements
3.	
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the 
internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements of the Holding Company and its subsidiary 
company, as aforesaid, based on our audit. We 
conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards 
on Auditing issued by the ICAI prescribed under Section 
143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit 
of internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements, and the Guidance Note issued by the ICAI. 
Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that 
we comply with ethical requirements and plan and 
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether adequate internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements were established and 
maintained and if such controls operated effectively in 
all material respects.
4.	
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain 
audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements 
and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements 
includes obtaining an understanding of such internal 
financial controls, assessing the risk that a material 
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design 
and operating effectiveness of internal control based 
on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend 
on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment 
of the risks of material misstatement of the financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error.
5.	
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained 
and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditor 
in terms of their reports referred to in the Other Matter 
paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements 
of the Holding Company, and its subsidiary company 
as aforesaid.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls 
with Reference to Consolidated Financial 
Statements
6.	
A company’s internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements is a process designed to 
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability 
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial 
statements for external purposes in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s 
internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements include those policies and procedures 
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, 
in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect 
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of 
the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that 
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit 
preparation of financial statements in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles, and 
that receipts and expenditures of the company are 
being made only in accordance with authorisations of 
Annexure A
Independent Auditor’s Report on the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements 
under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (‘the Act’)
management and directors of the company; and (3) 
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or 
timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or 
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a 
material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial 
Controls with Reference to Consolidated 
Financial Statements
7.	
Because of the inherent limitations of internal 
financial controls with reference to financial 
statements, including the possibility of collusion or 
improper management override of controls, material 
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not 
be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the 
internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements to future periods are subject to the risk that 
the internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements may become inadequate because of 
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance 
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
8.	
In our opinion and based on the consideration of 
the reports of the other auditor on internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements 
of the subsidiary company, the Holding Company 
and its subsidiary company, which are companies 
covered under the Act, have in all material respects, 
adequate internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements and such controls were operating 
effectively as at 31 December 2023, based on the 
internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements criteria established by the Company 
considering the essential components of internal 
control stated in the Guidance Note issued by the ICAI.
Other Matter
9.	
We did not audit the internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements insofar as it relates 
to one (1) subsidiary company, which are companies 
covered under the Act, whose financial statements 
reflect total assets of `184.7 million and net assets 
of `(64.8) million as at 31 December 2023, total 
revenues of `247.5 million and net cash inflows 
amounting to `3.5 million for the period ended on 
that date, as considered in the consolidated financial 
statements. The internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements in so far as it relates 
to such subsidiary company have been audited by 
other auditor whose report have been furnished to us 
by the management and our report on the adequacy 
and operating effectiveness of the internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements for 
the Holding Company and its subsidiary company, as 
aforesaid, under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act in so far as 
it relates to such subsidiary company is based solely on 
the reports of the auditor of such company.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter with 
respect to our reliance on the work done by and on the 
reports of the other auditor.

(Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 as 
amended and notified under Section 133 of the 
Companies Act, 2013 (the ‘Act’) and other relevant 
provisions of the Act.
	
	
The accounting policies adopted in the 
preparation of the CFS are consistent for all the 
periods presented.
	
	
The CFS are presented in Indian Rupees, which 
is the Group’s functional currency and all values 
are rounded off to the nearest million with one 
decimal place, except when otherwise indicated.
	
(ii)	 The CFS have been prepared on a historical cost 
convention basis, except for the following:
•	 certain financial assets and liabilities (including 
derivatives) that are measured at fair value;
•	 defined benefit plans - net defined benefit 
(asset) / liabilities – Fair value of plan assets 
less present value of defined benefit obligation.
2.2	Basis of consolidation
	
Subsidiaries:
	
Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has 
rights, to variable returns from its involvement with 
the investee and has the ability to affect those returns 
through its power over the investee. Specifically, the 
Holding Company controls an investee if and only if the 
Group has:
	
(i)	
Power over the investee (i.e., existing rights that 
give it the current ability to direct the relevant 
activities of the investee),
	
(ii)	 Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its 
involvement with the investee, and
	
(iii)	 The ability to use its power over the investee to 
affect its returns
	
The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an 
investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there 
are changes to one or more of the three elements of 
control. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the 
Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases 
when the Group loses control. Assets, liabilities, 
income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or 
disposed of during the years are included in the 
consolidated financial statements from the date the 
Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to 
control the subsidiary.
	
Consolidated financial statements are prepared using 
uniform accounting policies for like transactions and 
other events in similar circumstances. If a member of 
the group uses accounting policies other than those 
adopted in the consolidated financial statements for 
like transactions and events in similar circumstances, 
appropriate adjustments are made to that group 
member’s statements in preparing the consolidated 
financial statements to ensure conformity with the 
group’s accounting policies.
	
The consolidated financial statements of all entities 
used for the purpose of consolidation are drawn up to 
same reporting date as that of the parent Company, i.e., 
year ended on December 31, 2023.
	
Consolidation procedure:
	
i)	
Combine like items of assets, liabilities, equity, 
income, expenses and cash flows of the parent 
with those of its subsidiaries. For this purpose, 
income and expenses of the subsidiary are based 
on the amounts of the assets and liabilities 
recognised in the consolidated financial 
statements at the acquisition date.

ii)	
Offset (eliminate) the carrying amount of the 
parent’s investment in each subsidiary and the 
parent’s portion of equity of each subsidiary. 
Business combinations policy explains how to 
account for any related goodwill/ reserve.
	
iii)	
Eliminate in full intragroup assets and liabilities, 
equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating 
to transactions between entities of the group, 
profits or losses resulting from intragroup 
transactions that are recognised in assets (if 
any), such as inventory, are eliminated in full. 
Intragroup losses may indicate an impairment 
that requires recognition in the consolidated 
financial statements. Ind AS 12, Income Taxes 
applies to temporary differences that arise from 
the elimination of profits and losses resulting from 
intragroup transactions.
	
	
Consolidated Statement of profit and loss and 
each component of other comprehensive income 
(OCI) are attributed to the equity holders of the 
parent of the Group and to the non-controlling 
interests, even if this results in the non-
controlling interests having a deficit balance. 
When necessary, adjustments are made to 
the statements of subsidiaries to bring their 
accounting policies into line with the Group’s 
accounting policies. All intra-group assets and 
liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash 
flows relating to transactions between members of 
the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation.
	
	
A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, 
without a loss of control, is accounted for as an 
equity transaction. If the Group loses control over 
a subsidiary, it:
	
	
(i)	
Derecognises the assets (including goodwill) 
and liabilities of the subsidiary;
	
	
(ii)	 Derecognises the carrying amount of any 
non-controlling interests;
	
	
(iii)	 Derecognises the cumulative translation 
differences recorded in equity;
	
	
(iv)	 Recognises the fair value of the 
consideration received;
	
	
(v)	
Recognises the fair value of any 
investment retained;
	
	
(vi)	 Recognises any surplus or deficit in profit 
and loss;
	
	
(vii)	 Reclassifies the parent’s share of 
components previously recognised in OCI 
to profit and loss or retained earnings, as 
appropriate, as would be required if the 
Group had directly disposed of the related 
assets or liabilities.
2.3	Current and non-current classification
	
All assets and liabilities have been classified as current 
or non-current as per the Group’s normal operating 
cycle and other criteria set out in Schedule III of the 
Act. Based on the nature of the products and time 
taken between acquisition of assets for processing 
and their realisation in cash and cash equivalents, the 
Group has ascertained its normal operating cycle as 
twelve months for the purpose of current or non-current 
classification of assets and liabilities.
	
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities 
are classified as non-current assets and non-
current liabilities.
2.4	Significant accounting judgments, 
estimates and assumptions
	
The preparation of financial statements in conformity 
with Ind AS requires the Group’s management to make 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 
amounts of revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities. 
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
	
Estimates and judgments are reviewed on an ongoing 
basis. They are based on historical experience and 
other factors, including expectations of future events 
that may have a financial impact on the Group and that 
are believed to be reasonable under the circumstance. 
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimates are revised and future 
periods are affected.
	
The key assumptions concerning the future and 
other key sources of estimating uncertainty at the 
reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing 
a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are 
described below:
	
a)	
Impairment of assets
	
	
The evaluation of applicability of indicators of 
impairment of assets requires assessment of 
external factors (significant decline in asset’s 
value, significant changes in the technological, 
market, economic or legal environment, 
market interest rates etc.) and internal factors 
(obsolescence or physical damage of an asset, 
poor economic performance of the asset etc.) 
which could result in significant change in 
recoverable amount of the assets.
	
	
Goodwill recognised on business combination are 
tested for impairment at least annually or when 
events occur or changes in circumstances indicate 
that the recoverable amount of the asset to which 
these pertain is less than the carrying value. 
The recoverable amount of the asset is higher of 
value-in use and fair value less cost of disposal. 
The calculation of value in use involves use of 
significant estimates and assumptions which 
includes turnover and earnings multiples, growth 
rates and net margins used to calculate projected 
future cash flows, risk adjusted discount rate, 
future economic and market conditions.
	
b)	
Determination of the estimated useful lives
	
	
The Group uses its technical expertise along with 
historical and industry trends for determining the 
economic life of an asset/component of an asset. 
The useful lives are reviewed by management 
periodically and revised, if appropriate. In case of 
a revision, the unamortised depreciable amount 
is charged over the remaining useful life of 
the assets.
	
c)	
Current and deferred taxes
	
	
Significant management judgment is required to 
determine the amount of current and deferred 
taxes that can be recognised, based upon the 
likely timing and the level of future taxable profits 
together with future tax planning strategies.
	
d)	
Employee benefits
	
	
Management’s estimate of the Group’s obligation 
is determined based on actuarial valuation. 
An actuarial valuation involves making various 
assumptions that may differ from actual 
developments in the future. These include 
the determination of the discount rate, future 
salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the 
complexities involved in the valuation and its long-
term nature, these liabilities are highly sensitive 
to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions 
are reviewed at each reporting date.
	
	
The parameter most subject to change is the 
discount rate. In determining the appropriate 
discount rate for plans operated in India, the 
Group’s management considers the interest rates 
of Government bonds. Future salary increases and 
gratuity increases are based on expected future 
inflation rates for India.
	
	
Refer Note 40 for details of the key assumptions 
used in determining the accounting of these plans.
	
e)	
 Provision for inventory obsolesce
	
	
The inventories are valued at lower of cost and 
net realisable value after providing for cost of 
obsolescence wherever considered necessary. 
Estimates of net realisable value are based on the 
most reliable evidence available at the time the 
estimates are made, of the amount the inventories 
are expected to realise. These estimates take into 
consideration fluctuations of price or cost directly 
relating to events occurring after the end of the 
period to the extent that such events confirm 
conditions existing at the end of the period.
	
f)	
Business combinations
	
	
Business combinations are accounted for using 
Ind AS 103. Ind AS 103 requires the identifiable 
intangible assets and contingent consideration 
to be fair valued in order to ascertain the net 
fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities of the acquiree. Significant 
estimates are required to be made in determining 
the value of contingent consideration and 
intangible assets and their estimated useful life. 
These valuations are conducted by independent 
valuation experts.
2.5	Property, Plant and Equipment and 
intangible
	
Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) are stated at 
cost of acquisition or construction (including directly 
attributable expenses thereto), net of impairment loss 
if any, less depreciation / amortisation. Cost includes 
financing costs of borrowed funds attributable to 
acquisition or construction of qualifying fixed assets, 
up to the date the assets are put to use.
	
If significant parts of an item of PPE have different 
useful lives, then they are accounted for as separate 
items (major components) of PPE.
	
Capital work in progress is carried at cost, less any 
recognised impairment loss. Depreciation of these 
assets commences when the assets are substantially

ready for their intended use. Advances given towards 
acquisition or construction of PPE outstanding at each 
reporting date are disclosed as Capital Advances under 
“Other non-current Assets”
	
An item of PPE is de-recognised upon disposal or when 
no future economic benefits are expected to arise 
from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss 
arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of PPE 
is determined as the difference between the sales 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is 
recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
Cost of assets not ready for intended use, as on 
the reporting date, is shown under capital work-in-
progress. Advances given towards acquisition of 
property, plant and equipment outstanding as at 
reporting date are disclosed as “other non-current 
assets”.
	
Intangible assets are initially recognised at cost.
	
Intangible assets with definite useful lives are 
amortised on a straight line basis so as to reflect 
the pattern in which the asset’s economic benefits 
are consumed.
	
Expenditure pertaining to research is expensed 
out as and when incurred. Expenditure incurred on 
development is capitalized if such expenditure leads 
to creation of an asset, otherwise such expenditure is 
charged to the statement of profit and loss.
	
Depreciation / amortization
	
(i)	
Leasehold land is amortised over the period 
of lease using straight-line method (SLM) and 
included in depreciation and amortization in 
statement of profit and loss statement.
	
	
Useful lives are reviewed by the Group’s 
management at each reporting date and revised, 
if appropriate.
	
(ii)	 The useful lives have been assessed based on 
technical advice, taking into account the nature 
of the PPE and the estimated usage of the asset 
on the basis of management’s best estimation 
of obtaining economic benefits from those 
classes of assets. The estimated useful life is 
reviewed periodically, with the effect of any 
changes in estimate being accounted for on a 
prospective basis.
	
	
Such classes of assets and their estimated useful 
lives are as under:

low value of items costing INR 5,000 or less which 
are fully depreciated in the year when the assets 
are put to use.

arising on account of capital improvement or other 
factors is provided for prospectively over the 
remaining useful life.

2.6	Leases
	
Effective 1 January 2020, the Group has adopted Ind AS 
116 Leases which introduces single accounting model 
and requires a lessee to recognize assets and liabilities 
for all leases subject to recognition exemptions. The 
Company adopted Ind AS 116 Leases using modified 
retrospective approach.
	
Group as a lessee
	
The Group’s lease asset classes primarily consist of 
leases for land and buildings. The Group applies a 
single recognition and measurement approach for 
all leases, except for short-term leases and leases of 
low-value assets. The Group recognizes lease liabilities 
to make lease payments and right-of-use assets 
representing the right to use the underlying assets.
	
Right-of-use assets
	
The Group recognizes right-of-use assets at the 
commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the 
underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use 
assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted 
for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost 
of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease 
liabilities recognized, initial direct costs incurred, and 
lease payments made at or before the commencement 
date less any lease incentives received. Right-of-use 
assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over 
the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful 
lives of the assets. The useful life of Right-of-use assets 
varies from 2 to 10 years.
	
Lease liabilities
	
At the commencement date of the lease, the Group 
recognizes lease liabilities measured at the present 
value of lease payments to be made over the lease 
term. The lease payments include fixed payments 
(including in substance fixed payments) less any lease 
incentives receivable, variable lease payments that 
depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to 
be paid under residual value guarantees.
	
The lease payments also include the exercise price of 
a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised 
by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating 
the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising 
the option to terminate. Variable lease payments that 
do not depend on an index or a rate are recognized as 
expenses in the period in which the event or condition 
that triggers the payment occurs.
	
In calculating the present value of lease payments, 
the Group uses the interest rate implicit in the lease 
or, if not readily determinable, using the incremental 
borrowing rates in the country of domicile of the leases. 
After the commencement date, the amount of lease 
liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest 
and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, 
the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured 
if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, 
a change in the lease payments (e.g., changes to 
future payments resulting from a change in an index 
or rate used to determine such lease payments) or a 
change in the assessment of an option to purchase the 
underlying asset.
	
Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets
	
The Group applies the short-term lease recognition 
exemption to its short-term leases (i.e., those leases 
that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the 
commencement date and do not contain a purchase 
option). It also applies the lease of low-value assets 
recognition exemption to leases of office equipment 
that are considered to be low value. Lease payments on 
short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are 
recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the 
lease term.
	
Group as a lessor
	
Leases in which the Group does not transfer 
substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to 
ownership of an asset is classified as operating leases. 
Rental income arising is accounted for on a straight-line 
basis over the lease terms. Initial direct costs incurred 
in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are 
added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and 
recognized over the lease term on the same basis as 
rental income. Contingent rents are recognized as 
revenue in the period in which they are earned.
2.7	Impairment non-current financial assets
	
The carrying amounts of assets are reviewed at each 
reporting date to determine if there is any indication 
of impairment based on internal/external factors. 
Assessment of indication of impairment of an asset is 
made at the year end. An impairment loss is recognized 
wherever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its 
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the 
greater of the asset’s net selling price and value in 
use. In assessing value in use, the Group measures 
its ‘value in use’ on the basis of estimated discounted 
cash flows of projections based on current prices. 
After impairment, depreciation is provided on the 
revised carrying amount of the asset over its remaining 
useful life.
	
When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the 
carrying amount of the asset or a cash-generating unit 
is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable 
amount, so that the increased carrying amount does 
not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined had no impairment loss been recognised 
for the asset earlier.

2.8	Assets classified as held for sale
	
Assets classified as held for sale (including liabilities 
directly associated with those assets held for sales) 
that are available for immediate sale and where the 
sale is highly probable of being completed within one 
year from the date of classification are considered and 
classified as assets held for sale. Assets held for sale 
are measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair 
value less costs to sell except financial assets within 
the scope of Ind AS 109 - Financial Instruments. The 
determination of fair value less costs to sell includes 
use of management estimates and assumptions. The 
fair value of asset held for sale has been estimated 
using observable inputs such as price quotations.
2.9	Inventories
	
Inventories comprise of all costs of purchase, 
conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the 
inventories to their present location and condition.
	
Raw materials are valued at the lower of cost and net 
realisable value. Cost is ascertained on a moving 
weighted average basis, except for goods in transit 
which is ascertained on a specific identification basis.
	
Work-in-progress, finished goods and traded goods are 
carried at the lower of cost and net realizable value. 
Cost is determined on a weighted average basis. In 
case of work-in-progress and manufactured finished 
goods, cost includes material, labour and production 
overheads. Fixed production overheads are allocated 
on the basis of normal capacity of production facilities.
	
Net realisable value of work-in-progress and finished 
goods is determined with reference to the estimated 
selling price less estimated cost of completion and 
estimated costs necessary to make the sale of related 
finished goods as applicable.
	
Stores, spares and tools other than obsolete and slow-
moving items are carried at cost.
2.10	Foreign currency transactions
	
Initial recognition
	
Foreign currency transactions are translated in the 
functional currency, by applying to the foreign currency 
amount, the exchange rate between functional currency 
and foreign currency prevailing at the date of transaction.
	
Conversion
	
Foreign currency monetary items as at reporting date 
are translated using the closing exchange rate on 
that date.
	
Exchange differences
	
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from 
the settlement of such transactions and from 
the translation of monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at the year end 
exchange rates are recognised in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss in the year in which they arise, except 
exchange differences arising from the translation 
of qualifying cash flow hedge to the extent that the 
hedges are effective, which are recognized in Other 
Comprehensive Income (OCI).
2.11	Revenue recognition
	
Revenue from sale of goods is recognised when 
control of the goods or services are transferred to the 
customer at an amount that reflects the consideration 
to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange 
for those goods. The Group recognized revenue at a 
point-in-time. The point-in-time is determined when the 
control of the goods or services is transferred which 
is generally determined based on when the signiﬁcant 
risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the 
customer. Apart from this, the Group also considers its 
present right to payment, the legal title to the goods, 
the physical possession and the customer acceptance 
in determining the point in time where control has 
been transferred. The Group assesses promises in the 
contract that are separate performance obligations to 
which a portion of transaction price is allocated.
	
In determining the transaction price, the Group 
considers below, if any:
	
Variable consideration
	
This includes discounts, incentives, volume rebates, 
etc. It is estimated at contract inception and constrained 
until it is highly probable that a significant revenue 
reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized 
will not occur when the associated uncertainty with the 
variable consideration is subsequently resolved. It is 
reassessed at end of each reporting period.
	
Contract balances
	
Trade receivables: A receivable represents the 
Group’s right to an amount of consideration that is 
unconditional i.e. only the passage of time is required 
before payment of consideration is due.
	
Contract assets: Contract assets recognised in 
accordance with Ind AS 115, effective from 1 January 
2021, shall be amortise on systematic basis that is in 
consistence with the transfer to customer with goods or 
services to which assets relates.
	
Contract liabilities: A contract liability is the obligation 
to transfer goods or services to a customer for which 
the Group has received consideration (or an amount 
of consideration is due) from the customer. Contract 
liabilities are recognised as revenue when the Group 
performs under the contract.
	
Significant payment terms
	
Generally, the Group provides credit period ranging 
from 60 to 75 days.
	
Interest income
	
Interest income from a financial asset is recognised 
when it is probable that the economic benefits will 
flow to the Group and the amount of income can be 
measured reliably. Interest income is accrued on a time 
basis, by reference to the amortised cost and at the 
effective interest rate applicable.
2.12	Employee benefits
a)	
Short term employee benefits
	
Employee benefits payable wholly within twelve 
months of rendering the service are classified as 
short-term employee benefits and are recognised in 
the period in which the employee renders the related 
service and comprises part of compensated absences 
paid on annual basis.
b)	
Post-employment benefits
	
Defined benefit plans
	
All employees are covered under Employees’ Group 
Gratuity Scheme, which is a defined benefit plan. 
The Group contributes to a fund maintained with Life 
Insurance Company (LIC) on the basis of the year end 
liability determined based on actuarial valuation using 
the Projected Unit Cost Method. Remeasurements 
of the net defined benefit liability, which comprise 
actuarial gains/losses, return on plan assets (excluding 
interest) and the effect of asset ceiling (if any, excluding 
interest) are recognized in Other Comprehensive 
Income. Net interest expense and other expenses 
related to defined benefit plans are recognised in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
Defined contribution plans
	
All other employees are covered under contributory 
provident fund benefit of specific percentage 
contribution of basic salary. Certain employees are 
also covered by the Group managed superannuation 
fund. Both are defined contribution schemes and the 
contributions are charged to the Statement of Profit 
and Loss of the year, when the contributions to the 
respective funds are due. There are no obligations other 
than the contributions payable to the respective funds.
	
Long-term employee benefits
	
Provision for long-term employee benefits comprise 
of compensated absences. These are measured 
on the basis of year end actuarial valuation in line 
with the Group’s rules for compensated absences. 
Remeasurement gains or losses are recognized in 
statement of profit and loss in the period in which 
they arise.
2.13	Financial instruments
	
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to 
a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or 
equity instrument of another entity.
	
Financial assets
	
Initial recognition and measurement
	
Financial assets are recognized initially at fair value. 
Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the 
acquisition of financial assets (other than financial 
assets not recorded at fair value through profit 
and loss) are added to the fair value of financial 
assets. Transaction costs directly attributable to the 
acquisition of financial assets at fair value through 
profit and loss are recognised immediately in Statement 
of Profit and Loss.
	
With the exception of trade receivables, the Group 
initially measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, 
in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through 
profit or loss, transaction costs. Trade receivables that 
do not contain a significant financing component or for 
which the Group has applied the practical expedient are 
measured at the transaction price as disclosed under 
Revenue recognition policy.
	
Subsequent measurement
	
For the purposes of subsequent measurement, financial 
assets are classified into below categories:
•	 Financial assets at amortized cost;
•	 Financial assets including derivatives at fair value 
through profit or loss (FVTPL)
•	 Financial assets at fair value through other 
comprehensive income (FVTOCI)

Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to 
their initial recognition, except if and in the period 
the Group changes its business model for managing 
financial assets.
	
(i)	
Financial assets at amortized cost
	
	
Financial assets are subsequently measured at 
amortized cost if it meets both of the following 
conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:
•	 the financial asset is held within a business 
where the objective is to hold these assets in 
order to collect contractual cash flows; and
•	 the contractual terms of the financial asset give 
rise on specified dates to cash flows that are 
solely payments of principal and interest on the 
principal amount outstanding.
	
	
After initial measurement, such financial assets 
are subsequently measured at amortized cost 
using the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method. 
Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account 
any discount or premium on acquisition and fees 
or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR 
amortization is included in the Statement of Profit 
and Loss. The losses arising from impairment are 
recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. 
This category generally applies to trade and other 
receivables, loans and other financial assets.
	
(ii)	 Financial assets including derivatives at fair value 
through profit or loss (FVTPL)
	
	
Financial assets are measured at fair value 
through profit or loss unless it is measured at 
amortized cost or at fair value through other 
comprehensive income on initial recognition. 
The transaction costs directly attributable to the 
acquisition of financial assets at fair value through 
profit or loss are immediately recognized in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
(iii)	 Financial assets at fair value through other 
comprehensive income (FVTOCI)
	
	
Financial assets are measured at fair value 
through Other Comprehensive Income if these 
financial assets are held within a business 
whose objective is achieved by both collecting 
contractual cash flows and selling financial 
assets and contractual terms of the financial 
asset give rise to cash flows on specified dates 
that are solely payments of principal and interest 
on the principal amount outstanding. Derivative 
instruments included in FVTOCI category are 
measured initially as well as at each reporting date 
at fair value. Movement in fair value is recognized 
in OCI.
	
Derecognition
	
A financial asset is derecognized when the right to 
receive cash flows from the asset has expired or the 
Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows 
from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the 
received cash flows in full without material delay to a 
third party and the Group has transferred substantially 
all risks and rewards of the asset or has transferred 
control of the asset to a third party. On derecognition of 
a financial asset in its entirety, the differences between 
the carrying amounts at the date of derecognition 
and the consideration received is recognized in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
Impairment of financial assets
	
The Group applies the expected credit loss (ECL) 
model for measurement and recognition of impairment 
losses on trade receivables or any other financial 
assets that result from transactions that are within 
the scope of “Ind AS 115 – Revenue from Contracts 
with Customers”. The Group follows the simplified 
approach for recognition of impairment loss allowance 
on receivables (net of advances). The application of the 
simplified approach does not require the Group to track 
changes in credit risk. As a practical expedient, the 
Group uses a provision matrix to determine impairment 
loss allowance on trade receivables. Impairment loss 
allowance (or reversal) during the period is recognized 
in the Statement of Profit and Loss. This amount is 
reflected under the head ‘Other expenses (or other 
income)’ in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
Financial liabilities
	
Initial recognition and measurement
	
Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, 
as measured at amortised cost or financial liabilities 
at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). A financial 
liability is classified as at FVTPL if it is classified as 
held for trading or is a derivative or it is designated 
as such on initial recognition. The Group’s financial 
liabilities include trade payables and other payables.
	
Equity instruments issued by the Group are classified 
as equity in accordance with the substance of the 
contractual arrangements and the definitions of a 
financial liability and an equity instrument. An equity 
instrument is any contract that evidences a residual 
interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of 
its liabilities.
	
Subsequent measurement
	
Financial liabilities, including derivatives, which are 
designated for measurement at FVTPL are subsequently 
measured at fair value. Other financial liabilities such 
as deposits are measured at amortised cost using 
Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method.
	
Derecognition
	
A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation 
under the liability is discharged or cancelled or 
expired. When an existing financial liability is replaced 
by another from the same lender on substantially 
different terms, or the terms of an existing liability 
are substantially modified, such an exchange or 
modification is treated as the derecognition of the 
original liability and the recognition of a new liability. 
The difference in the respective carrying amounts is 
recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
Offsetting of financial instruments
	
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset 
and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet if 
there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the 
recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle 
on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the 
liabilities simultaneously.
	
Derivative instruments
	
The Group uses foreign currency forward contracts 
to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency 
fluctuations relating to highly probable and forecast 
transactions. These forward contracts are stated at fair 
value at each reporting date. Changes in the fair value 
of these forward contracts that are designated and 
effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised 
directly in cash flow hedge reserve under OCI, net 
of taxes and the ineffective portion is recognised 
immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss. 
Amounts accumulated in cash flow hedge reserve 
are reclassified to Surplus (Profit and loss balance) 
in the same period during which the forecasted 
transaction occurs.
	
Hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively 
when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, 
terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for 
hedge accounting. For forecasted transactions, any 
cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument 
recognised in cash flow hedge reserve is retained until 
the forecasted transaction occurs. If the forecasted 
transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net 
cumulative gain or loss recognised in cash flow hedge 
reserve is immediately transferred to the Statement of 
Profit and Loss for the period.
2.14	Income and deferred taxes
	
Tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. 
Current income tax is measured at the amount expected 
to be paid to the tax authorities in accordance with 
the provisions of the Indian Income Tax Act, 1961. 
Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on 
temporary differences between the tax base of assets 
and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial 
reporting purposes at the reporting date.
	
Deferred tax is measured based on the tax rates and tax 
laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all 
taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are 
recognized for all deductible temporary differences, the 
carry forward of unused tax credits and any unused tax 
losses. Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent 
that it is probable that taxable profit will be available 
against which the deductible temporary differences, 
and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused 
tax losses can be utilized.
	
Deferred tax relating to items recognized outside 
Statement of Profit and Loss is recognized outside 
Statement of Profit and Loss. Deferred tax items are 
recognized in correlation to the underlying transaction 
either in Other Comprehensive Income or directly 
in Equity.
	
At each reporting date, the Group reassesses 
unrecognized deferred tax assets. It recognises 
unrecognized deferred tax assets to the extent that 
it has become probable that sufficient future taxable 
income will be available against which such deferred 
tax assets can be realised.
2.15	Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and 
Contingent Assets
	
Provisions are recognized when the Group has a 
present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of 
past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources 
will be required to settle the obligation and in respect 
of which a reliable estimate can be made of the 
amount of obligation. Provisions are not discounted 
to its present value and are determined based on

best estimates required to settle the obligation at the 
reporting date. These are reviewed at each reporting 
date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimates.
	
A disclosure by way of a contingent liability is made 
when there is a possible obligation or a present 
obligation that may, but probably will not, require 
an outflow of resources. Contingent assets are not 
recognised or disclosed in the financial statements.
2.16	Warranties
	
Provisions for the expected cost of warranty obligations 
are recognised at the time of sale of the relevant 
products, at the best estimate of the expenditure 
required to settle the Group’s obligation.
2.17	Earnings per share
	
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the 
net profit or loss for the year attributable to equity 
shareholders, by the weighted average number of 
equity shares outstanding during the period.
	
Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing 
the net profit or loss for the year attributable to 
the equity shareholders, by the weighted average 
number of equity and equivalent diluted equity shares 
outstanding during the year except where the results 
would be antidilutive.
2.18	Cash and cash equivalents
	
Cash and cash equivalents include cheques in hand, 
cash at bank and deposits with banks having original 
maturity of not more than three months.
2.19	Fair value measurement
	
The Group’s accounting policies and disclosures require 
the measurement of fair values for both financial 
and non-financial assets and liabilities. Fair value is 
the price that would be received to sell an asset or 
paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the measurement 
date. The Group has an established control framework 
with respect to the measurement of fair values. The 
Group’s management regularly reviews significant 
unobservable inputs and valuation adjustments. 
If third party information is used to measure fair 
values, then the Group’s management assesses the 
evidence obtained from the third parties to support the 
conclusion that such valuations meet the requirements 
of Ind AS, including the level in the fair value hierarchy 
in which such valuations should be classified.
	
When measuring the fair value of a financial asset or a 
financial liability, the Group uses observable market 
data as far as possible. Fair values are categorized into 
different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the 
inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows:
	
Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets 
for identical assets or liabilities.
	
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included in 
Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, 
either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived 
from prices).
	
Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not 
based on observable market data (unobservable 
inputs).
	
If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an 
asset or a liability fall into different levels of the fair 
value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is 
categorized in its entirety in the same level of the 
fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is 
significant to the entire measurement.
	
The Group recognises transfers between levels of the 
fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period 
during which the change has occurred. In determining 
the fair value of its financial instruments, the Group 
uses a variety of methods and assumptions that are 
based on market conditions and risks existing at 
each reporting date. The methods used to determine 
fair value includes discounted cash flow analysis, 
available quoted market prices and dealer quotes. All 
methods of assessing fair value result from general 
approximation of value and the same may differ from 
the actual realised value. Further information about the 
assumptions made in measuring fair value is included 
in the Note 2.13 on financial instruments
2.20	Segment Reporting - Identification of 
Segments:
	
An operating segment is a component of the Group that 
engages in business activities from which it may earn 
revenues and incur expenses, whose operating results 
are regularly reviewed by the Group’s Chief Operating 
Decision Maker (“CODM”) to make decisions for which 
discrete financial information is available. Based on 
the management approach as defined in Ind AS 108, 
the CODM evaluates the Groups’s performance and 
allocates resources based on an analysis of various 
performance indicators by business segments and 
geographic segments.
2.21	Business combinations
	
The Group accounts for its business combinations 
under the acquisition method. The cost of an 
acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the 
consideration transferred measured at acquisition 
date fair value and the amount of any non-controlling 
interests in the acquiree. For each business 
combination, the Group elects whether to measure the 
non-controlling interests in the acquiree at fair value or 
at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable 
net assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed 
as incurred.
	
At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets 
acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognised 
at their acquisition date fair values. For this purpose, 
the liabilities assumed include contingent liabilities 
representing present obligation and they are measured 
at their acquisition fair values irrespective of the fact 
that outflow of resources embodying economic benefits 
is not probable.
	
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the 
financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate 
classification and designation in accordance with 
the contractual terms, economic circumstances and 
pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date
	
Goodwill
	
Goodwill represents the cost of acquired business as 
established at the date of acquisition of the business 
in excess of the acquirer’s interest in the net fair value 
of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities less accumulated impairment losses, if any. 
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or when 
events or circumstances indicate that the implied fair 
value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount.
2.22	Exceptional items
	
When items of income and expense within statement of 
profit or loss from ordinary activities are of such size, 
nature or incidence that their disclosure is relevant 
to explain the performance of the enterprise for the 
period, the nature and amount of such material items 
are disclosed separately as exceptional items.
2.23	Recent accounting pronouncements
	
Standards issued but not yet effective
	
Ministry of Corporate Affairs ("MCA") notifies new 
standard or amendments to the existing standards. 
There is no such notification which would have been 
applicable from January 1, 2024.

38	 Financial risk management
The Group has exposure to the following risks arising from financial instruments:
•	 market risk [refer 38 (A) below]
•	 liquidity risk [refer 38 (B) below]
•	 credit risk [refer 38 (C) below]
In the course of its business, the Group is exposed primarily to aforesaid risks, which may impact the fair value of its 
financial instruments. The Group has a risk management system which not only covers the foreign exchange risks but also 
other risks associated with the financial assets and liabilities such as credit risks. The risk management strategy is approved 
by Board of Directors which is implemented by the Group's management. The risk management framework aims to create a 
stable business planning environment by reducing the impact of market related risks, credit risks and currency fluctuations 
on the Group’s earnings. The risks identified through the risk management system are analysed and evaluated by the 
Group's management and reported to the Board of Directors periodically along with report of planned mitigation measures.
A)	 Market risk
	
Market risk is the risk of any loss in future earnings, in realizable fair values or in future cash flows that may result from 
a change in the price of a financial instrument. The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in 
the foreign currency exchange rates, liquidity and other market changes. Future specific market movements cannot be 
normally predicted with reasonable accuracy.
	
(i)	
Foreign currency risk
	
	
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from foreign currency transactions, primarily with respect to 
the US Dollars and Euro. Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions and recognised assets 
and liabilities denominated in a currency that is not the Group’s functional currency (Indian Rupees).
	
	
The Group has import and export transactions in foreign currencies. Imports are higher than exports and hence 
the Group has foreign currency exposure to the extent of imports being higher than exports. The risk of foreign 
currency fluctuation is mitigated through hedging. Please refer Note 37 for details of foreign currency exposure.

(ii)	 Interest rate risk
	
	
Interest rate risk exposure: The Group does not have interest bearing borrowings and interest rate risk is towards 
opportunity cost on investment in tax free bonds. Surplus funds are being invested in bank deposits at fixed 
interest rates and the tenure is managed to match with the Group's liquidity profile.
B)	 Liquidity risk
	
The Group's principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents and cash flows generated from operations. The 
Group regularly monitors actual cash flows and forecasts to ensure that the Group maintains sufficient liquidity to meet 
the operation needs.
	
The following table shows the maturity analysis of the Company's financial liabilities based on contractually agreed 
undiscounted cash flows (except lease liabilities refer Note 47) at the balance sheet date:

C)	 Credit Risk
	
Credit risk is the unexpected loss in financial instruments if the counter parties fails to discharge it's contractual 
obligations in entirety and timely. The Group is exposed to credit risks arising from it's operating and financing 
activities such as trade receivables, loans and advances and other financial instruments. The carrying amounts of 
financial assets represent the maximum credit exposure.
	
Trade receivables
	
Credit risk on trade receivables is limited due to the Company's diversified customer base which includes public 
sector enterprises and reputed private corporates. For trade receivables, the Company computes expected credit loss 
allowance based on provision matrix which is prepared considering customer's industry segment and historically 
observed overdue rate over expected life of trade receivables ranging from 0.04% to 0.78%, except for few customer 
where specific provisions is being created. The expected credit loss allowance is considered as a percentage of net 
receivable position.

Characteristics of defined benefit plans and risks associated with them:
	
Valuations of defined benefit plan are performed on certain basic set of pre-determined assumptions and other 
regulatory framework which may vary over time. Thus, the Group is exposed to various risks in providing the above 
benefit plans which are as follows:
	
(i)	
Interest Rate risk: The plan exposes the Group to the risk of fall in interest rates. A fall in interest rates will result in 
an increase in the ultimate cost of providing the above benefit and will thus result in an increase in the value of the 
liability (i.e. value of defined benefit obligation).
	
(ii)	 Salary Escalation Risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan is calculated with the assumption of salary 
increase rate of plan participants in future. Deviation in the rate of increase of salary in future for plan participants 
from the rate of increase in salary used to determine the present value of obligation will have a bearing on the 
plan’s liability.
	
(iii)	 Demographic Risk: The Group has used certain mortality and attrition assumptions in valuation of the liability. The 
Group is exposed to the risk of actual experience turning out to be worse compared to the assumption.
	
(iv)	 Investment Risk: The Group has funded with well established Govt. of India undertaking & other IRDA approved 
agency and therefore, there is no material investment risk.
