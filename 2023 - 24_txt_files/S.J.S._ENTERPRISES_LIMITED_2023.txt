1.
Energy 
Management
Risk
In manufacturing operations, 
a significant amount of energy 
is usually utilised for various 
purposes such as operating 
machinery, providing heating 
and cooling, and lighting 
facilities. Any interruptions 
in energy supply, whether 
caused by power outages, 
fluctuations 
in 
prices, 
or 
issues with quality, can result 
in operational disruptions. 
These disruptions may lead 
to 
delays 
in 
production 
schedules and impact the 
quality of products. Besides 
the financial consequences, 
inadequate 
energy 
management can also cause 
operational 
disruptions 
for the company, resulting 
in product delays, quality 
problems, and interruptions 
in the supply chain.
In response to energy management 
risks, the company has adopted 
a proactive approach focused 
on promoting energy efficiency 
and sustainability throughout its 
operations. This involves a series 
of strategic initiatives, including 
the widespread installation of 
solar panels across its facilities, 
procurement of wind and solar 
power, and reducing electricity 
consumption from conventional 
sources like BESCOM. Additionally, 
the company is actively exploring 
and investing in energy-efficient 
technologies 
and 
increasing 
its procurement of power from 
renewable sources. Furthermore, 
the company has installed EV 
charging stations and entirely 
dependent on renewable energy 
sources. Notably, the Bengaluru 
facility has achieved LEED Gold 
certification (Leadership in Energy 
Efficiency 
and 
Environmental 
Design) 
from 
the 
US 
Green 
Building Council, underscoring its 
commitment to energy efficiency 
and environmentally sustainable 
practices.
POSITIVE
Although there are upfront 
expenses 
associated 
with 
installing 
solar 
panels, 
procuring 
wind 
power, 
and 
making 
other 
capital 
investments, 
the 
company 
can realise significant long-
term cost savings through 
these actions. By reducing 
its 
dependence 
on 
costly 
fossil fuels, such as traditional 
grid electricity, the company 
can 
mitigate 
future 
price 
fluctuations and stabilise its 
energy expenses. Moreover, 
the implementation of energy-
efficient 
technologies 
and 
practices 
further 
enhances 
operational 
efficiency, 
leading to decreased energy 
consumption 
and 
lower 
overall costs. Consequently, 
this positive impact on the 
Company’s 
financials 
can 
observed over time.

2.
Water & Waste 
Management
Risk
Water is essential for cooling 
machinery, 
cleaning 
parts, 
and 
various 
production 
stages, 
making 
any 
disruptions in supply or usage 
restrictions 
detrimental 
to 
production 
schedules 
and 
operational 
effectiveness. 
Moreover, 
water 
scarcity 
in operational regions can 
lead to supply shortages, 
increased costs, and potential 
conflicts 
over 
resources. 
On the waste management 
front, 
the 
generation 
of 
wastewater 
containing 
pollutants 
necessitates 
careful handling to prevent 
environmental pollution and 
health hazards. Regulatory 
compliance is paramount in 
both water usage and waste 
management to avoid fines, 
legal 
repercussions, 
and 
damage to the company’s 
reputation.
In response to the water and 
waste management risks inherent 
in its operations, the Company 
has 
implemented 
a 
proactive 
strategy focused on efficiency, 
sustainability, 
and 
regulatory 
compliance. As part of this strategy, 
The Company has installed water-
efficient fixtures such as low-flow 
toilets and faucets to minimise 
water consumption. Additionally, 
staff members receive thorough 
training 
in 
proper 
water 
management techniques to ensure 
responsible usage throughout the 
organisation.
The Company has established 
efficient 
wastewater 
treatment 
processes, 
including 
Sewage 
Treatment 
Plants 
(STP) 
and 
Effluent Treatment Plants (ETP). 
These 
facilities 
process 
liquid 
waste, converting it into reusable 
water 
and 
sludge, 
thereby 
minimising environmental impact 
and promoting resource efficiency. 
The treated water derived from 
this process is reused for purposes 
such 
as 
toilet 
flushing 
and 
gardening.
Furthermore, 
the 
Company 
has installed Reverse Osmosis 
(RO) water plants to ensure 
access 
to 
high-quality 
water 
for 
manufacturing 
processes. 
Company has implemented a zero 
liquid discharge mechanism which 
ensures that no liquid waste is 
discharged from the facility.
To ensure the safe and responsible 
disposal of waste, the sludge 
is handed over to authorised 
vendors who specialise in its 
appropriate 
management 
and 
disposal. Through these measures, 
the Company effectively mitigates 
water and waste management risks, 
demonstrating its commitment to 
environmental stewardship and 
sustainability while safeguarding 
its operations and reputation.
POSITIVE
The 
comprehensive 
water 
and 
waste 
management 
measures implemented by the 
Company not only contribute 
to environmental sustainability 
but also generate financially 
positive results. By optimising 
water usage and minimising 
wastage, 
the 
facility 
can 
significantly reduce its water 
consumption, 
resulting 
in 
lower 
water 
bills 
and 
operational costs. Additionally, 
improved 
wastewater 
treatment can help the facility 
avoid regulatory fines, which 
can protect the company’s 
financial resources. Moreover, 
by demonstrating responsible 
water management practices, 
the Company can enhance 
its 
reputation, 
potentially 
attracting 
environmentally 
conscious 
customers 
and 
investors, thereby positively 
impacting sales, and revenue. 
Moreover, the zero liquid 
discharge 
mechanism 
minimises disposal costs and 
potential 
fines 
associated 
with improper waste disposal. 
Therefore, 
while 
initially 
investing in water and waste 
management 
infrastructure 
and 
initiatives 
may 
incur 
upfront costs, the long-term 
financial benefits far outweigh 
these 
expenses, 
ultimately 
generating positive results for 
the Company.

Waste & 
Hazardous 
Materials 
Management
Risk
The manufacturing process 
involves the use of various 
raw materials and chemicals, 
some of which may be 
hazardous to human health 
and 
the 
environment. 
Improper handling, storage, 
or disposal of these materials 
can lead to contamination 
of soil, water, and air, posing 
risks 
to 
ecosystems 
and 
human health. Additionally, 
regulatory 
non-compliance 
regarding waste management 
can result in legal penalties, 
fines, and damage to the 
company’s reputation.
Packaging plays a crucial 
role in the supply chain of 
finished products, ensuring 
their 
safe 
transportation 
and delivery to customers. 
However, excessive or non-
sustainable packaging can 
contribute 
to 
resource 
depletion, waste generation, 
and environmental pollution. 
By 
adopting 
eco-friendly 
packaging 
materials 
and 
optimising packaging designs 
to reduce material usage, 
the company can minimise 
its 
carbon 
footprint 
and 
conserve natural resources. 
Furthermore, 
implementing 
responsible disposal practices, 
such as recycling or reusing 
packaging materials, helps 
divert waste from landfills 
and reduces environmental 
pollution.
The Company has implemented 
a 
comprehensive 
waste 
management plan to address the 
risks associated with waste and 
materials management effectively. 
To ensure efficient waste disposal, 
the 
Company 
engages 
waste 
collection agents appointed by 
Local Authorities, who conduct 
regular 
pickups 
according 
to 
scheduled intervals.
In 
handling 
hazardous 
waste, 
the Company has established 
a well-defined plan to ensure 
proper identification and storage 
practices, 
minimising 
the 
risk 
of spillage. Hazardous waste is 
exclusively disposed of through 
authorised parties, with meticulous 
records 
maintained 
to 
track 
disposal activities.
Additionally, 
the 
Company 
categorises 
waste 
into 
three 
distinct 
levels 
of 
risk, 
each 
accompanied 
by 
appropriate 
packaging and labelling for easy 
identification during emergencies.
By 
adhering 
to 
these 
waste 
management 
practices, 
the 
Company 
demonstrates 
its 
commitment 
to 
environmental 
responsibility and the promotion 
of a safe working environment.
The company has taken the 
additional step of registering on 
Extended Producer Responsibility 
(EPR) platforms. This indicates 
the company’s commitment to 
environmental 
sustainability 
and its willingness to actively 
participate in programs aimed at 
reducing its environmental impact.
POSITIVE
First, the company has adopted 
waste 
reduction 
strategies 
such as lean manufacturing 
principles to minimise waste 
generation 
at 
the 
source 
and 
optimise 
production 
processes. 
Strict 
protocols 
and 
training 
programs 
should be established for the 
proper 
handling, 
storage, 
and disposal of hazardous 
materials to mitigate health 
and safety risks.
Further 
to 
better 
waste 
management practices, the 
Company is in the process of 
establishing procedures.

the Company employs several 
proactive 
strategies. 
Firstly, 
it 
maintains a diversified supplier base 
and cultivates strong relationships 
with 
multiple 
suppliers. 
This 
approach 
reduces 
dependency 
on any single source, enhancing 
the Company’s ability to respond

and 
dissatisfied 
customers, 
negatively impacting revenue 
and brand loyalty. Overall, 
ineffective 
supply 
chain 
management can lead to a 
cascade of financial challenges, 
including increased production 
costs, lost revenue, reputation 
damage, 
and 
regulatory 
compliance costs.

section 
of 
the 
Company’s 
Sustainable Procurement Policy, 
a 
commitment 
is 
made 
to 
cultivate 
an 
environmentally 
friendly and responsible value

responsible resource consumption, 
including sustainable practices in 
packaging materials. Moreover, 
the Company expects suppliers 
to establish and maintain robust 
Quality 
Management 
Systems, 
comply 
with 
relevant 
local 
regulations, participate in training

reviews and internal audits, and 
monitor 
and 
minimise 
their 
environmental impact through the 
adoption of green initiatives and 
sustainable practices.

affect profitability. Fluctuations 
in material prices, scarcity, or 
market 
conditions 
present 
challenges and potential cost 
increases, which may adversely 
impact 
the 
Company’s 
financial performance.
POSITIVE:

sustainable and eco-friendly 
materials, 
while 
initially 
incurring higher costs, can lead 
to long-term savings. These 
materials often offer increased 
durability and longer lifespans, 
reducing the need for frequent 
replacements 
and 
repairs. 
Moreover, 
the 
adoption 
of 
sustainable 
materials 
aligns with the Company’s 
environmental commitments, 
potentially decreasing waste 
management 
and 
disposal 
expenses. As a result, strategic 
utilisation 
of 
sustainable 
materials can yield financial 
benefits while demonstrating 
the Company’s dedication to 
environmental responsibility.

Is there a mechanism available to receive and redress grievances for the following categories of employees and

Yes/No (If Yes, then give details of the mechanism in brief)
Permanent Workers
Yes, the Company is committed to providing an inclusive and supportive work environment for all 
employees. As part of this commitment, we have established a grievance redressal mechanism to 
address any concerns or issues that employees may have.
	 Every employee in the company will receive respectful and dignified treatment, free from any 
form of discrimination. There shall be no tolerance for Physical, Sexual, Psychological, or Verbal 
Harassment or Abuse towards any employee.
	 Employees are encouraged to communicate their concerns, complaints, grievances, and 
suggestions through the following channels:
	
a.	 Utilising complaint/suggestion boxes placed strategically within the unit.
	
b.	 Contacting business unit heads directly.
	
c.	
Registering complaints in writing with the Grievance Desk.
Upon receipt of a grievance, our internal grievance committee will review the matter and utilise an 
escalation matrix to determine the most appropriate course of action. This matrix outlines a set of 
steps that are designed to facilitate the resolution of the grievance, taking into consideration various 
factors such as the severity of the grievance, the seniority of the involved parties, and the timeline for 
resolution.

Yes/No (If Yes, then give details of the mechanism in brief)
Our escalation process comprises several stages, including:
A.	 Informal Discussion with Supervisor:
	
The first stage of our escalation process involves encouraging employees to speak with their 
manager before filing a formal grievance. This informal discussion can often help to bridge 
communication gaps and allow for issues to be resolved quickly and effectively.
B.	 Formal Written Grievance:
	
If the informal discussion is not successful in resolving the grievance, employees can file a formal 
written grievance. We have developed a grievance form that employees can use to document their 
concerns.
C.	 Evaluation of Grievance:
	
Once a formal grievance has been received, the grievance committee will evaluate the matter and 
determine the appropriate course of action. This can include mediation or other forms of conflict 
resolution.
D.	 Conduct a Formal Investigation:
	
In some cases, a formal investigation may be necessary to gather additional information or 
evidence. This may involve interviewing witnesses and gathering documents in order to arrive at a 
fair and impartial resolution.
	
Upon conclusion of the investigation, the grievance committee will work towards creating a 
resolution that is fair and equitable for all parties involved. Our aim is to ensure that grievances 
are resolved in a timely and impartial manner, and that employee’s feel supported and valued 
throughout the process.
	
It is important to note that our grievance policy recognises and provides for Anonymous Reporting 
Option and ensures that No employee will face retaliation for filing a grievance or participating in 
the grievance resolution process.

Provide the measures 
undertaken by the 
entity to ensure that 
statutory dues have 
been deducted and

chain partners.
Prior to engaging with any vendors, we conduct thorough due diligence to assess their credibility and compliance 
history. This includes reviewing their commitment towards ESG , health and safety and human rights assessment , 
past performance, and adherence to legal requirements, including statutory deductions and deposits.
To ensure rigorous compliance with statutory dues across our value chain, we have implemented a comprehensive 
vendor survey questionnaire. Within this questionnaire, specific inquiries are made regarding the vendors’ 
processes and practices related to statutory deductions and deposits. By integrating this questionnaire into our 
vendor survey process, we establish clear expectations regarding legal compliance and accountability throughout 
our supply chain.
Vendors must demonstrate adherence to all relevant legal requirements, including statutory obligations related to 
labour laws, environmental regulations, and any other applicable laws and regulations in their jurisdiction.

LEADERSHIP INDICATORS:
1.
Provide the processes for consultation 
between stakeholders and the Board 
on economic, environmental, and social 
topics or if consultation is delegated, 
how is feedback from such consultations 
provided to the Board.
Management actively engages with various stakeholders, including investors, employees, and 
customers, as part of our ongoing business operations. These interactions occur both during 
planned events and as necessary to address specific needs or concerns. Any feedback or issues 
that warrant the attention of the Board are promptly brought to their notice. Suggestions, 
complaints, or grievances from stakeholders are communicated through established channels 
and processes. For these purposes, we have a stakeholder management policy in place, 
providing stakeholders with a structured route to address grievances and ensure effective 
resolution. Depending on their importance and impact, these matters are escalated to the 
relevant committees within the Board for careful consideration and resolution. This systematic 
approach ensures that all stakeholder feedback and concerns are appropriately addressed and 
managed within the organisational framework.
2.
Whether stakeholder consultation is 
used to support the identification and 
management of environmental, and 
social topics (Yes / No). If so, provide 
details of instances as to how the inputs 
received from stakeholders on these 
topics were incorporated into policies 
and activities of the entity.
Yes. The Company conducts materiality assessments to understand and identify pertinent 
environmental and social issues relating to its operations and stakeholders. These assessments 
actively seek input from stakeholders to ensure that key concerns and priorities are accurately 
reflected in the entity’s sustainability strategy, objectives, and reporting frameworks.
Stakeholder engagement involves consultations with various parties, including local community 
members, healthcare professionals, and government officials. These consultations may entail 
assessing healthcare and educational needs in the area, as well as identifying schools with the 
greatest requirements, and tailoring support accordingly.
Additionally, stakeholder input plays a crucial role in shaping initiatives with social impact, such 
as education and skill development programs, free eye check-ups for children, distribution 
of school bags and e-learning kits. Furthermore, environmental initiatives like the Clean 
Village Initiative Campaign for waste management, construction of RO water plants, providing 
support upto 200 underprivileged women with vocational trainings were also taken up by 
the Company. This collaborative approach ensures that the organisation’s sustainability efforts 
are aligned with the needs and expectations of its stakeholders, fostering meaningful impact 
within the community.
3.
Provide details of instances of 
engagement with, and actions taken 
to, address the concerns of vulnerable/ 
marginalised stakeholder groups.
As a socially responsible Organisation, we are committed to working for the welfare of 
the communities around us. The Company has established community outreach programs 
specifically targeting vulnerable or marginalised groups. These programs include educational 
workshops, job training initiatives, health awareness campaigns, or access to basic services 
like clean water or sanitation like providing vocational training to 200 women in tailoring, 
computer skills, and driving, with a focus on facilitating job placement opportunities. Company

Mechanism to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases.
Mechanism to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases.
To prevent harassment in the workplace, the company has established a mechanism that consists of various policies, procedures, and 
guidelines. The mechanism includes a code of conduct that outlines the company’s expectations for appropriate workplace behaviour and 
provides guidance on identifying and addressing harassment.
The company has also established a confidential reporting system that allows employees to report any incidents of harassment without fear 
of retaliation. These reports are thoroughly investigated, and corrective action is taken where necessary. Additionally, the company provides 
regular training to all employees on identifying and preventing harassment in the workplace.
Confidentiality is strictly maintained throughout the process, ensuring that information is shared only with those directly involved in resolving 
the grievance. This safeguards the privacy and integrity of the parties concerned, minimising the risk of sensitive details being exposed 
unnecessarily. Furthermore, the policy includes a commitment to non-retaliation, guaranteeing that no employee will face repercussions 
for filing a grievance or participating in its resolution. This discourages any form of retaliation and fosters an environment where employees 
feel safe to voice their concerns without fear of retribution. Additionally, the option for anonymous reporting provides an alternative avenue 
for employees who may be uncomfortable reporting grievances openly. This option allows concerns to be addressed while protecting the 
anonymity of the reporting party, ensuring their safety and encouraging transparency in addressing workplace issues. Together, these 
measures create a supportive framework that prioritises fairness, confidentiality, and the well-being of all employees involved in the 
grievance process.
To ensure compliance with its harassment prevention policies, the company conducts regular audits and assessments of its workplace 
culture and practices. These assessments help identify areas for improvement and ensure that the company is taking all necessary steps to 
prevent harassment.

 Mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge:
Has the entity 
implemented a 
mechanism for Zero 
Liquid Discharge? If 
yes, provide details 
of its coverage and 
implementation.
In its commitment to being a responsible corporate citizen, the Company has mechanisms to treat and recycle 
all the wastewater generated by their industrial processes. They have installed a state-of-the-art treatment plant 
that uses a combination of physical, chemical, and biological processes to treat the wastewater. The treated 
water is then passed through a series of filtration and evaporation processes to remove all the impurities and 
contaminants, leaving behind only pure and clean water that can be reused within the plant. The remaining solid 
waste is disposed off in a responsible and environmentally sustainable manner.
The Company has established Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) and Effluent Treatment Plants (ETPs), the Company 
endeavours to minimise the quantity of water discharged to the greatest extent possible, in accordance with 
feasible measures.

•	
The liquid from the Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) undergoes processing in the STP plant, where it is 
converted into sludge, and the treated water is repurposed for flushing toilets and gardening purposes.
•	
The liquid from the Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) is treated in the ETP plant, resulting in the production of 
ETP sludge, which is then disposed of in an environmentally responsible manner by appointing authorised 
vendors.
By adopting a Zero Liquid Discharge mechanism, the Company has been able to reduce its dependence on 
freshwater sources, minimise its impact on the environment, and ensure that all the wastewater generated is 
treated and recycled in a responsible and sustainable manner.

Briefly describe the 
waste management 
practices adopted in your 
establishments. Describe the 
strategy adopted by your 
company to reduce usage 
of hazardous and toxic 
chemicals in your products 
and processes and the 
practices adopted to manage 
such wastes.
The Company has implemented a waste management system that ensures proper handling, segregation, 
transportation, and disposal of different types of wastes, thus promoting environmental sustainability and 
the safety of the workers involved in waste management.
A color-coding system exists for the purpose of categorising various types of wastes. The colour red is 
employed to denote hazardous waste, green is designated for biodegradable waste, yellow is utilised for 
adhesive waste, and blue is assigned to plastic waste. This system aids in the convenient identification and 
segregation of different waste types, thereby facilitating effective disposal.
The safety of workers is crucial in waste management, as they are exposed to various hazards while handling 
waste. Hence the provision of safety Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is given to the workers who handle 
waste.
An authorised vendor has been identified for receiving scraps and waste. This ensures that the waste is 
collected and handled by a responsible and authorised vendor.
Waste disposal is routed through an approved vendor by KSPCB (Karnataka State Pollution Control Board)
Separate transportation facility for waste disposal purposes. This ensures that the waste is transported in a 
safe and organised manner and is disposed of in an environmentally responsible manner.
The Company identifies and monitors waste categories beyond the four-color-coded categories. These 
categories include E-waste, aluminium waste, roll storage waste, and metal scraps, and require specialised 
handling and disposal techniques.
