focus is on the development of 
its employees and has invested 
in many training & development 
initiatives. These include a detailed

of the organizations policies and 
practices, functional training, 
compliance trainings, and online 
modules.

needs.

can impact employee 
performance, leading to

productivity, reduced 
commitment to 
organization goals. In 
labs it can also lead to 
material wastage.

Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan? Give details in 100 words/ web link:
	
The company has meticulously developed a comprehensive Business Continuity Plan (BCP) tailored specifically for 
its IT Services. The primary objective of this plan is to facilitate uninterrupted operations from an alternate location 
in the event of unforeseen circumstances or disruptions at the primary site.
	
When the Disaster Recovery (DR) Plan is activated, the company’s IT systems seamlessly transition to the DR facility, 
strategically located in a different seismic zone. This geographical separation enhances the resilience and stability 
of the IT infrastructure. The BCP plan encompasses several key objectives:
	
1. 	
Timely Business Recovery: The plan aims to restore business operations within the agreed-upon timeframe 
outlined in the policy terms. This ensures minimal disruption and enables the company to swiftly 
resume operations.
	
2. 	
Continuous IT System Functionality: The BCP plan guarantees that IT systems continue to function seamlessly 
from the alternate location until the primary site is fully restored. This uninterrupted availability of IT services is 
essential for maintaining business continuity and mitigating the impact on critical operations.
	
3. 	
Crisis Response Guidelines: The plan includes detailed guidelines on how the company should respond during 
crisis situations. These guidelines assist in managing and mitigating potential risks and challenges associated 
with disruptive events.

strategic initiative mirrors the company’s future goals to assess and address environmental impacts across its 
entire value chain.
