enhanced growth of the greenery. By employing the Miyawaki method, the company aims to 
create self-sustaining, low-maintenance green spaces.

about 21,500 trees at the Aurangabad Facility and about 15,000 trees at the Hyderabad 
Facility. We have planted about 5,450 trees at the Aurangabad facility and about 6,107 trees 
at the Hyderabad facility using the innovative Miyawaki afforestation method, as well as 
other traditional methods. The plantation is expected to grow in multiple layers with an 
annual growth rate of 1 metre. Within 2 years, the resultant plantation is expected to become 
self-sustainable.
b.	 The company has purchased 16 Electric Vehicles (6 in FY 2022-23 and 10 in FY 2023-24)

the last two years. To support the transition further, the company plans to introduce more 
Electric Vehicles in its fleet, based on requirement.

the share of renewable electricity in the company’s energy mix, an enhancement of the 
renewable power to 3 MW is planned.

the Aurangabad Plant has a capacity of 50 KLD.
	
The treated water from these plants is utilized for on-site gardening, promoting a sustainable approach to water management. 
Additionally, the sludge generated undergoes is carefully digested in a controlled wetland area in the STP. The dried sludge is 
used as fertilizer, reducing waste while promoting eco-friendly practices.

10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your 
company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to 
manage such wastes
	
In the endeavor to develop a sustainable ecosystem, we have been striving to create value by adopting 3R (Reduce, Reuse 
& Recycle) principles. At our manufacturing facilities, waste is categorized into hazardous and non-hazardous categories. 
Non-hazardous waste is further categorised as recyclable or non-recyclable. We manage waste in compliance with the OCP 
for Material Handling, with recyclable waste handled by state-authorised vendors who have been certified by the pollution 
control board. Battery recycling is facilitated by returning the batteries to the suppliers, whilst e-waste is processed by state 
authorised recyclers. 
	
This necessitates a constant emphasis on three essential areas:
 
 
Consuming less energy 
 
 
Recycling solid and liquid waste 
 
 
Recovering carbide, oils, and lubricants
