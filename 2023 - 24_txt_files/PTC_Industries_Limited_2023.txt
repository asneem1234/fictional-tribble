Is there a mechanism available to receive and redress grievances for the following categories of employees and worker? 
If yes, give details of the mechanism in brief. 
Yes/No (If yes, then give details of the mechanism in brief)
Permanent workers
Yes, The company has established a Grievance Policy for 
its employees, providing them with a platform to express 
their employment-related concerns. This policy ensures that 
grievances are addressed promptly, fairly, and impartially 
by a dedicated Grievance Committee, in line with the 
organization’s other policies. The scope of these grievances 
includes concerns about the behavior, inaction, or proposed 
action of a supervisor, another employee, or management. The 
grievance redressal system outlined in the policy encourages 
open communication as the first step towards resolution. 
Employees are advised to seek an informal resolution with 
their immediate supervisor initially. If this dialogue does not 
resolve the issue, and the employee feels that their complaint 
has escalated to a grievance, they can file a formal grievance 
as per the policy to seek a fair resolution.
To facilitate this process, the company provides a grievance 
form, available both online and in physical form. This form is 
used to raise grievances, which are then addressed through 
the grievance redressal process. This approach ensures 
that every employee’s concerns are heard and addressed 
effectively.

PTC Industries is dedicated to the ongoing enhancement and innovation of its manufacturing processes to minimize consumption and 
emissions. The company has embarked on several initiatives to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions:
	
a.	
Utilization of Renewable Energy: PTC Industries has harnessed a substantial amount of solar electricity (891 MWh) and wind 
turbine-generated electricity (446.18 MWh). In addition, PTC Industries is proactively developing a de-carbonization strategy 
that aims to enhance the energy mix by embracing renewable energy sources and substituting fossil fuels with alternatives 
that emit less.
30
PTC Industries Limited
	
b.	
Shift to Cleaner Fuels: PTC Industries acknowledges the environmental and cost advantages of PNG (Piped Natural Gas) and 
LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) systems over diesel-based ones. PTC Industries has incorporated natural gas furnaces in its 
castings and heat treatment furnace pipelines. This transition not only offers a cleaner substitute with a higher potential for 
energy savings but also aids in reducing GHG emissions. When utilized in new systems, natural gas combustion releases 50 to 
60 percent less carbon dioxide (CO2).
	
c.	
Adoption of Efficient Heating Solutions: PTC Industries uses induction heaters as an alternative to electric furnaces for heating 
castings during the machining process. This change significantly decreases power usage, thereby contributing to overall 
energy efficiency.
	
d.	
Implementation of LED Lighting: PTC Industries appreciates the advantages of LED lighting, which include superior luminous 
efficiency and enhanced safety. LED lights drastically cut down CO2 emissions by reducing fuel consumption compared to 
traditional lights. To further lessen its carbon footprint, PTC Industries has initiated a program to retrofit existing machinery and 
fuel systems to enable them to function on fuels with lower carbon intensity. This initiative has led to a significant decrease in the 
usage of LDO (Light Diesel Oil) and an increase in the use of CNG (Compressed Natural Gas), a fuel with lower energy intensity. As 
a result, PTC Industries has effectively reduced carbon emissions from its manufacturing processes by substituting equivalent 
energy sources with CNG, demonstrating its commitment to environmental sustainability.

10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishment. Describe the strategy adopted by your 
Company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to 
manage such wastes. 
	
PTC Industries has prioritized waste management by integrating the principles of the 3R (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) approach into its 
decision-making processes. This strategic focus reflects the company’s commitment to environmental stewardship and its dedication 
to finding innovative solutions to address its waste challenges. By adhering to the solid waste management hierarchy, PTC encourages 
its teams to continuously explore ways to divert waste from landfills. A key area of emphasis is the reduction of both hazardous and 
non-hazardous waste across its manufacturing sites.
	
Throughout the year, PTC Industries has implemented various measures to drive its waste management initiatives. These include 
recycling waste oil through alternative disposal pathways to minimize the hazardous waste load, as well as recycling Effluent 
Treatment Plant (ETP) sludge to reduce the need for landfill disposal.
	
To gain a comprehensive understanding of its waste profile, PTC’s sites have meticulously mapped waste generation and disposal 
methods. The company has also enhanced its data collection systems, incorporating waste volumes into its monthly environmental 
dashboard. This data-driven approach enables PTC to make informed decisions and track its progress towards achieving its 
sustainability goals.
	
PTC Industries recognizes that its waste management efforts face three primary barriers: cost constraints, regulatory challenges, 
and limited resources. The company remains committed to addressing these barriers and continuously enhancing its waste 
management practices.
	
1.	
Managing Hazardous Waste: PTC ensures proper handling of hazardous wastes in accordance with regulatory requirements, 
maintaining a comprehensive waste registry. These wastes are transported to authorized agencies that specialize in their 
appropriate handling, underscoring the company’s commitment to environmental compliance and safety.
	
2.	
Managing Non-Hazardous Waste: PTC Industries places significant emphasis on waste reduction at the source for non-
hazardous waste. Through practical and cost-effective solutions, the company has achieved remarkable successes, such as 
utilizing recycled cardboard boxes as filler for packing materials and introducing reusable pallets for parts and product delivery.
	
	
By implementing these innovative waste management strategies, PTC Industries demonstrates its core values of environmental 
responsibility, continuous improvement, and the creation of shared value. The company’s unwavering dedication to sustainable 
practices not only benefits the environment but also positively impacts its business operations.

(a)	
Do you have a preferential procurement policy where you give preference to purchase from suppliers comprising 
marginalized/vulnerable groups? (Yes/No) – 
	
	
PTC Industries has a preferential procurement policy that emphasizes supporting local suppliers and Micro, Small, and Medium 
Enterprises (MSMEs). The company believes in nurturing local economies and promoting sustainable growth within the 
communities where it operates.
	
	
However, it is essential to clarify that while PTC prioritizes local and MSME suppliers, it does not give preference based solely on 
marginalized or vulnerable group status. The company's procurement decisions are primarily driven by factors such as quality, 
cost-effectiveness, reliability, and the ability to meet its specific business requirements.
	
	
PTC recognizes that in certain cases, suppliers from marginalized or vulnerable groups may not possess the necessary capacity 
or specialization to form an effective supply chain for specific items being procured. The company's focus remains on creating 
a robust and efficient supply chain that ensures the highest standards of product quality and delivery reliability, while also 
maximizing the positive impact on local communities and MSMEs.
	
	
PTC Industries firmly believes in fostering diversity and inclusivity within its workforce and supply chain. The company remains 
open to exploring innovative ways to support the growth and capacity-building of marginalized groups, should they possess the 
requisite expertise and resources to meet the company's procurement needs.
	
(b)	
From which marginalized/vulnerable groups do you procure? – 
	
	
PTC Industries recognizes the importance of supporting local and small-scale suppliers as part of its procurement practices. The 
company prioritizes engaging with Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in its supply chain, reflecting its commitment 
to fostering a more inclusive business ecosystem.
	
	
However, PTC's preference for local and MSME suppliers is not solely based on their belonging to marginalized or vulnerable 
groups. The company's primary focus is on ensuring the capacity, specialization, and effectiveness of its supply chain in meeting 
its core procurement needs.
	
(c)	
What percentage of total procurement (by value) does it constitute? –
	
	
The company engages with select small businesses to support its canteen operations and food supply at the AMTC Plant in 
Lucknow and the Mehsana Plant in Ahmedabad. While the contribution from these marginalized suppliers may be relatively 
modest compared to the company's overall procurement, PTC values their participation and the opportunity to create positive 
impact within the local communities. This strategic approach reflects the company's core values of social responsibility, 
empowerment, and the creation of shared prosperity.
