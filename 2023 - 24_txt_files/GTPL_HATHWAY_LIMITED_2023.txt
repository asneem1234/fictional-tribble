Waste 
Management and 
circular economy
Risk
Improper waste management practices have 
significant impacts on the environment and human 
health. Failure to comply with regulations set by 
central authorities can result in legal penalties and 
harm to the brand's reputation.
The company has established procedures for waste 
management. We utilize recyclable materials such 
as copper cables, and all generated metal scrap is 
disposed of in compliance with regulations through 
registered recyclers.
Negative
Information 
Protection
Risk
The company depends on its technology 
infrastructure to safeguard data and information. 
With most information stored and transactions 
conducted online, this increases the risk of 
information security breaches.
The organization maintains a robust cyber risk 
management system overseen by its information 
technology team. Efforts have been intensified to 
educate employees, customers, and stakeholders 
on cybercrime, data privacy, and related concerns.
Negative
Governance and 
Accountability
Risk
This issue directly affects organizations because 
inadequate governance can erode customer 
confidence and trust. Strong governance and 
accountability structures are essential for fostering 
long-term, sustainable business operations.
We 
have 
a 
strong 
governance 
framework 
established with clear roles and responsibilities. We 
are actively enhancing our governance practices.
Negative
Customer 
relationship 
management
Opportunity
As a service provider, CRM plays a crucial role 
by enabling us to gain deeper insights into our 
customers, thereby enhancing satisfaction and 
increasing retention rates.
We operate a complaint management system 
through call centres and complaint centres, 
ensuring quick response times to maintain positive 
customer relationships. Additionally, we offer 
E-support for seamless day-to-day operations.
Positive
Risk Management
Opportunity
Risk management is an opportunity for companies 
to enhance resilience and operational efficiency. 
Proactively 
identifying 
and 
mitigating 
risks 
safeguards assets, reputation, and business 
continuity. It minimizes financial losses, regulatory 
penalties, and instils confidence in stakeholders. 
Moreover, effective risk management uncovers 
opportunities 
for 
innovation 
and 
growth, 
navigating uncertainties for sustainable success.
The Company identify and adopt the highest 
standards and practices in risk management and 
compliance in order to establish a robust and 
proactive approach to the effective mitigation and 
management of all significant risks to our business.

managing the disposal of end-of-life, defective, and unusable products. 
GTPL actively promotes the reuse of set-top boxes to reduce waste generation. Through its network 
of local cable operators, the company collects used set-top boxes, refurbishes them, and reintroduces 
them to customers, emphasizing sustainability and operational efficiency. This approach not only 
minimizes environmental impact but also optimizes resource utilization.
In cases where reclaimed products cannot be refurbished and reused, GTPL has established a specific 
procedure for disposing of such items using certified e-scrapers. This disposal process strictly complies 
with government regulations for the safe handling of e-waste, battery waste, and hazardous materials, 
ensuring responsible and environmentally sound practices in waste management.

Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues.
	
The company takes a thorough approach to handling human rights grievances, employing various internal mechanisms. It 
conducts proactive due diligence to detect and prevent any potential adverse impacts on human rights, prohibits violations 
by its staff and partners, and integrates human rights respect into its fundamental management systems. Accessible grievance 
channels are provided for those affected by its operations, with a firm stance against exploiting vulnerable groups like child 
and forced labour. Furthermore, the company respects employees’ core rights, such as freedom of association and collective 
bargaining, and maintains an open dialogue with trade unions.
	
We are dedicated to creating a platform for stakeholders to voice concerns and report any breaches of the GTPL Code of 
Conduct, company policies, or legal obligations, including human rights violations. To support this, we’ve implemented a 
vigilance mechanism, also known as the whistle-blower policy, enabling employees to report misconduct or violations without 
fear of retaliation. This commitment to human rights is deeply rooted in the company’s ethos, permeating its culture, values, and 
operations, guiding decisions and actions at all levels.

ensure their comfort and safety. It will be ensured that no retaliatory actions are taken against the complainant or any witnesses 
in any form. If the accused individual is an external party, they will be restricted from accessing GTPL premises except for 
involvement in Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) proceedings. The accused individual will be prohibited from writing any 
performance evaluation or appraisal reports concerning the complainant.

Waste Management
STBs (Set top boxes) that are not functioning 
properly are taken back from the customers 
via the LCOs and supplied to vendors where 
they are cleaned and repacked to be re-used 
by the customers.
This reduces the use & dependency of 
virgin/ new STBs by the customers. This 
helps to reduce the manufacturing of new 
STBs and further reduce the generation of 
waste.
5.	
Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan? Give details in 100 words/ web link.
	
GTPL, a provider of Digital Cable TV services directly or through Cable Operators, relies heavily on three key components 
for business continuity: the Headend, the Wired Network across all operational locations, and the IT Infrastructure for its 
Conditional Access System (CAS) and Subscriber Management System (SMS). These components are critical for GTPL’s 
business operations, necessitating a Disaster Management Plan centered around them. As part of its Business Continuity Plan, 
GTPL has established a Disaster Recovery (DR) Site in Kolkata, strategically located far from its main setup in Ahmedabad, 
western India.
	
The DR Site includes backup instances for Customer Data, where the implementation of Oracle 19c database in Oracle Cloud 
Infrastructure (OCI) ensures real-time data synchronization with live data (T+5 minutes). For CAS Data, key instances (NSTV & 
Nagra) are replicated at the DR site, covering 80% of the current base. The SMS Applications, essential for operational support 
and billing, have one set of applications (GTPL Saathi, Edge+, MQ, Report Server, Workforce, etc.) replicated daily at the DR site, 
with a NUTONIX cluster implemented at the STT Global Data Centre, Kolkata. The Headend Compression System uses multiple 
compression systems across Ahmedabad, Kolkata, Mehsana, and Tiruchendur, with all locations interconnected via dedicated 
Point-to-Point links and a backup dish antenna site in Ahmedabad.
	
Additionally, GTPL’s ERP Data is supported by equivalent infrastructure in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), and the Wired 
Network has a Ring or Redundancy Network created for enhanced reliability. This Disaster Management Plan ensures that 
GTPL can maintain business continuity and protect critical operations in the event of a disaster.
6.	
Disclose any significant adverse impact to the environment, arising from the value chain of the entity. What 
mitigation or adaptation measures have been taken by the entity in this regard.
	
GTPL promotes environmental stewardship throughout its value chain, urging the adoption of eco-friendly practices. The 
company aims to incorporate sustainability into its procurement processes, extending beyond regulatory compliance to ensure 
vendors prevent or mitigate any negative environmental impacts.
7.	
Percentage of value chain partners (by value of business done with such partners) that were assessed for
