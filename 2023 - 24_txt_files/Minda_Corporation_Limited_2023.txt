Energy 
Management
Risk
In order to address the issue of 
climate change, companies like Minda 
Corporation have a crucial role to 
play in spearheading decarbonization 
initiatives. This entails reducing energy 
intensity, minimizing dependence on 
fossil fuels, and investing in renewable 
energy sources. MCL has been 
actively working towards achieving 
a transition to low- carbon practices 
by implementing efficient energy 
management strategies and reducing 
the use of fossil fuel based energy. 
It is crucial to acknowledge that at a 
global level, investors and stakeholders 
are increasingly seeking sustainable 
collaborations. Neglecting to invest 
in such measures could potentially 
expose companiesto risks.
MCL 
has 
made 
substantial investments 
in renewable energy, 
specifically solar power, 
and remains committed 
to exploring avenues to 
decrease reliance on 
fossil fuels. It is crucial to 
improve the integration 
of energy management 
into 
our 
corporate 
ESG strategy, and we 
are actively working 
towards reducing our 
carbon footprint and 
encouraging 
efficient 
energy usage.

Materials 
Efficiency
Opportunity
The 
international 
community 
is 
increasingly focused on finding ways 
to minimize material consumption by 
promoting circularity and reuse. MCL 
looks to seize this chance and strive 
for enhanced materials efficiency. 
It is fundamental, in the current 
global landscape, to participate in 
sustainable sourcing and assess the 
ecological and societal impacts of 
goods and materials.
Enhancing 
materials 
efficiency presents MCL 
with 
a 
chance 
to 
decrease its expenses 
on 
various 
products, 
leading to cost reduction 
through effective material 
reuse.
Positive
3
Waste 
Management
Risk
MCL’s operations generate waste 
that must be converted for reuse and 
recovery to support circularity. Poor 
waste management practices, like 
ineffective disposal methods, lead to 
air and water pollution, as well as land 
degradation. This, in turn, pollutes 
groundwater levels and facilitates 
the spread of diseases. MCL presently 
entrusts the management of both 
hazardous and nonhazardous waste 
to an approved waste vendor.
MCL 
must 
prioritize 
finding 
solutions 
to 
minimize 
waste 
going to landfills and 
incineration, as these 
methods are harmful to 
the environment. MCL 
is exploring circularity 
strategies to recycle 
and repurpose waste, 
while also committing 
to 
investing 
in 
advanced technologies, 
decreasing 
hazardous 
waste 
usage, 
and 
minimizing 
material 
wastage.

Product 
Quality & 
Safety
Risk and 
Opportunity
Ensuring the quality and safety 
of our products is of utmost 
importance 
to 
manufacturing 
enterprises like MCL. We understand 
that failing to meet these standards 
can have detrimental effects, such 
as diminished customer satisfaction, 
disrupted supply and value chains, 
and potential legal repercussions 
or fines, ultimately resulting in 
substantial financial losses for the 
company
MCL 
is 
dedicated 
to 
upholding 
the 
utmost quality and 
safety 
standards 
of 
its 
products, 
aligning with the best 
practices worldwide. 
Furthermore, 
MCL 
intends to improve its 
management systems 
to 
ensure 
product 
safety, 
effectively 
address 
any 
non-
compliance concerns, 
and 
ensure 
the 
provision of premium 
products for secure 
utilization. 
These 
investments will not 
only boost customer 
confidence but also 
strengthen the overall 
value chain.

Occupational 
Health & 
Safety
Risk
MCL recognizes the immense value 
of our employees and workers. We 
prioritize their wellbeing and safety 
above all else, which is why we have 
implemented a strong occupational 
health and safety system. This 
system ensures that risks are 
promptly 
identified, 
mitigated, 
and guarantees a secure working 
environment for everyone. As a 
result, our organization has achieved 
remarkable 
employee 
retention 
rates across all our plants.
MCL conducts regular 
safety 
inspections 
internally and externally, 
and upholds specialized 
committees to ensure 
the 
welfare 
and 
protection of its staff 
and employees at all its 
sites. Additionally, MCL 
possesses the necessary 
safety certifications such 
as 
ISO 
45001:2018 
that are essential for 
maintaining 
a 
safe 
working environment.
Negative
6
Business 
Ethics
Risk
Business ethics are of utmost 
importance in creating a transparent 
and sustainable corporate	
governance framework. At MCL, we 
have successfully implemented a 
strong business ethics environment 
across all our facilities. We place great 
emphasis on policies and actions 
that promote good governance, 
recognizing the significance of 
a comprehensive and top-down 
approach to Environmental, Social, 
and Governance (ESG) practices. 
Our ESG strategies are seamlessly 
integrated into our governance 
and policy frameworks, allowing 
us to establish a well-structured 
governance system that upholds 
business ethics. We consistently 
monitor the changing regulatory 
landscape in the country to ensure 
compliance with all relevant laws 
and regulations, both at the union 
and federal levels. This enables us to 
effectively navigate and implement 
good governance measures.
MCL prides itself on 
having a robust and 
comprehensive internal 
governance structure. 
By 
implementing 
initiatives such as the 
Whistleblower Policy, 
Prevention of Insider 
Trading, Related Party 
Transactions, 
and 
Grievance 
Redressal 
for all stakeholders, 
MCL 
ensures 
a 
workplace culture that 
is grounded in ethical 
principles. The MCL 
Code of Conduct for 
employees and board 
members 
upholds 
transparency 
and 
ethical standards in all 
business dealings.

Supply Chain 
Management
Risk
Supply 
chain 
management 
plays a crucial role in influencing 
different aspects such as the 
quality of products and services, 
delivery efficiency, costs, customer 
satisfaction, and ultimately, the 
profitability of a business. In today’s 
interconnected 
world, 
supply 
chains not only form the backbone 
of manufacturing firms like ours 
but are also vulnerable to various 
disruptions. 
These 
disruptions 
can stem from a range of factors, 
including the ongoing pandemic, 
geopolitical conflicts such as the 
Russia-Ukraine conflict, and the 
constantly 
evolving 
regulatory 
environment with initiatives like 
CBAM. Consequently, trade and 
supply chains face continuous	
interruptions. Moreover, the tangible 
risks linked to climate change are 
impacting the sourcing of raw 
materials in a negative manner. 
To ensure uninterrupted business 
operations, MCL is dedicated to 
establishing a resilient and efficient 
supply chain management system 
capable of withstanding these 
challenges 
and 
averting 
any 
detrimental effects on our activities.
MCL 
is 
presently 
enhancing 
agile 
and 
robust 
supply 
chain 
management 
systems to ensure	
uninterrupted business 
operations 
despite 
potential disruptions in 
the supply chain. This 
involves 
identifying 
key suppliers at Tier 1, 
2, and Tier 3 levels to 
understand the origins 
of our raw materials 
and the overall value 
chain of our products. 
Inadequate 
supply 
chain 
management 
could lead to financial 
setbacks and reduced 
profits. 
Additionally, 
we plan to conduct 
a 
vulnerability 
assessment to confirm 
that 
our 
supply 
chain is adequately 
equipped to sustain 
business 
activities 
during 
unforeseen 
disruptions.
