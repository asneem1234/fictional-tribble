Enhancing 
availability of 
product
Opportunity
A significant proportion of patients 
in numerous low and middle-income 
countries encounter financial 
limitations when attempting to obtain 
affordable medicines.
As a pharmaceutical company, 
we prioritise making life-saving 
medicines accessible, available, 
and affordable for patients. Also, 
due to our role in society, we are 
uniquely positioned to reduce health 
disparities, and enable improved 
health outcomes.
	y

We are committed to serving 1.5 bn 
patients by 2030 and bring at least three 
innovative solutions to improve the 
standard of treatment every year from 
2027. We are working to achieve our 
goals by launching more innovative drugs 
and expanding our product portfolio, 
increasing our go-to-market through 
diverse collaborations and licensing 
arrangements, and through greater 
presence in public health
	y
We are partnering with multilateral and 
donor agencies to address the global 
disease burden, neglected tropical 
diseases, and emergency disease areas.

holistic approach to healthcare, running 
several innovative programmes, offering 
one-of-its-kind patient care and disease 
management initiatives that service 
patients digitally or through hybrid means. 
We also participate in strengthening 
public health delivery systems through 
the training and capacity building of 
health workers and local stakeholders

Regulatory

Risk
Regulatory guidelines and 
requirements heavily regulate the 
manufacturing of our products, 
including manufacturing quality 
standards. Periodic inspections are 
conducted on our manufacturing 
sites, and if the regulatory and 
quality standards and systems are 
not found adequate, it could result in 
observations. This might impact our 
ability to meet patient demand and 
generate value for our stakeholders.
	y
We are fully dedicated to quality and 
have robust quality processes and 
systems in place at our developmental 
and manufacturing facilities to ensure that 
every product is safe and of high quality
	y
We have integrated “Quality by Design” 
to build quality into all processes and use 
quality tools to minimise process risks
	y
We continue to spend significant 
time, money and effort in the areas 
of production and quality testing to 
help ensure full compliance with 
cGMP regulations

We leverage information technology 
to digitise and enhance our quality 
assurance and quality control processes

Water
Management
Waste
Management
Risk/
Opportunity
The potential risks to water and 
sanitation services posed by 
climate change include damage to 
infrastructure, leading to the loss of 
services, and deterioration in water 
quality – impacts that all increase 
risks to health. Water is a critical 
input into the manufacturing of 
medicines, used as a raw material 
in the production, processing and 
formulation of APIs, intermediates 
and finished pharmaceutical 
products (FPP), in the preparation 
of solvents and reagents, and for 
cleaning (e.g. washing and rinsing).
	y
Water risks are assessed as part of an 
established enterprise risk management 
framework periodically. We conducted 
thorough water risk and evaluation 
studies in all of our watersheds to identify 
alternative rich water resources
	y
Our water management strategy involves 
key focus areas including water efficiency 
and optimisation, identifying alternate water 
sources for water security, and creating 
freshwater potential beyond the fence. 
Since FY2023, we are a water positive 
company. We do not discharge any water to 
the surface, ground, or sea, and therefore 
do not emit any substance or pollutants to 
any form of water
	y
We have waste management systems in 
place at all our facilities. We do not dispose 
any non-hazardous waste through landfill 
or incineration. Our non-hazardous waste 
is either recycled, reused, or recovered 
through other means
Negative/Positive
5
Energy and
emissions
management
Risk
The close relationship between 
health and climate is undeniable, 
as illustrated by the consequences 
of extreme weather events on food 
security, the harmful air pollution 
resulting from wildfires, and the 
rising prevalence of infectious 
diseases. As a pharmaceutical 
company, the bulk of direct 
emissions come from running 
boilers and indirect emissions from 
purchased electricity.
	y
We are committed to leading the energy 
transition with a goal to be 100% 
powered by renewable sources by 2030, 
and to be a carbon neutral company in 
our direct operations by 2030
	y

Our decarbonisation strategy 
focusses on energy mix, conservation, 
performance, transition, and eventually 
carbon sequestration with meaningful 
investments in afforestation and 
sustainable agriculture. This includes 
reducing our energy consumption 
with energy-efficient technologies and 
processes, adopting low or no carbon 
fuels, substituting fossil fuels in boilers 
with alternate biomass fuel sources such 
as rice husk and sawdust briquettes, 
purchasing energy from renewable 
sources, and realigning our business 
operations to lower emissions

Talent 
attraction
and retention
Risk
The ability to attract and retain the 
right technical talent with required 
skill sets is a challenge. The industry 
is highly knowledge-driven and 
technology-based, and heavily 
reliant on specialist individuals.
	y
We use analytics to measure employee 
performance, identify current skill gaps, 
and address risks to improve retention
	y
We actively address and resolve 
structural talent gaps by providing 
long‑term reskilling and upskilling 
opportunities to our workforce, including 
digital learning initiatives
	y
We embed workforce planning into our 
operations strategy, and this helps in 
fostering internal mobility for well-suited 
roles, enhancing people productivity and

for our stakeholders over the long 
term. We promote inclusiveness 
through concerted interventions 
across different business and

Combating
counterfeit
medicines
Risk
Our industry has been increasingly 
challenged by the vulnerability 
of distribution channels to illegal 
counterfeiting and the presence 
of counterfeit products in a 
growing number of markets and 
over the internet. Third parties 
may illegally distribute and sell 
counterfeit versions of our products, 
which do not meet the rigorous 
manufacturing and testing standards 
that our products undergo. 
Counterfeit products are unsafe or 
ineffective and can be potentially 
life‑threatening.
	y
We are implementing a comprehensive 
set of measures that includes the 
implementation of the Drug Supply 
Chain Security Act (DSCSA) in 
the US and equivalent regulations 
in the other geographies such as 
Russia, Uzbekistan, EU, and worked 
closely with the Government of 
India for the implementation of the 
serialisation guidelines
	y
These measures have helped us 
establish a robust system that enables 
us to track and trace our medicines 
from the point of manufacture to the 
point of dispensing

Opportunity
Health education empowers people 
to increase control over their health. 
Disease prevention is important to 
minimise the burden of diseases 
and associated risk factors. Primary 
prevention avoids the manifestation 
of a disease, and secondary 
prevention (early detection) 
improves the chances for positive 
health outcomes.

Business 
continuity
Risk
We operate in an environment 
that entails potential challenges 
and uncertainties arising from 
geopolitical factors and intricate 
regulatory frameworks. This includes 
geopolitical instability, changes in 
government policies, trade disputes, 
sanctions, and intricate compliance 
requirements. These factors can 
pose risks to operations, supply 
chains, market access, and overall 
business performance, requiring 
proactive monitoring and strategic 
adaptation to mitigate potential 
adverse impacts.

Business 
ethics/bribery
and 
corruption
Risk
Any action by our employees 
or business partners which are 
unethical or pertains to bribing and 
corruption can create a damage to 
our reputation and business growth.
	y
Our Code of Business Conduct and 
Ethics (COBE) applies to all Directors 
and employees of our Company, its 
subsidiaries, and affiliates. It lays down 
the principles that guide our conduct 
and strengthens our decision-making, 
promotes stakeholder trust and works 
as a defence around our business. 
COBE has been designed to comply with 
the requirements of Companies Act, 2013, 
and the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and 
its implementing regulations
	y
We conduct our business as per our 
Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption policies, 
and all applicable laws. While contracts 
with our suppliers, contractors, and 
business partners include adherence to 
our principles concerning ethics, there is 
also a separate code of conduct required 
to be followed by our suppliers and 
service providers, which is modelled on 
the Principles for Responsible Supply 
Chain Management (PSCI) and 100% 
compliance is mandatory. We have a 
Global Marketing Code which provides 
minimum set of standards for interaction 
with healthcare professionals and 
healthcare institutions while engaging

Geo-political 
risk
Risk
We have operations in certain 
countries susceptible to political and 
economic instability that could lead 
to disruption or other adverse impact 
on such operations.
Significant portions of our 
manufacturing operations are 
conducted outside the markets 
in which our products are sold, 
and accordingly we often import a 
substantial number of products into 
such markets. We may, therefore, 
be denied access to our customers 
or suppliers or denied the ability to 
ship products from any of our sites 
as a result of closing of the borders 
of the countries in which we sell our 
products, or in which our operations 
are located, due to economic, 
legislative, political and military 
conditions, including hostilities and 
acts of terror, in such countries.
	y
We continue to monitor the effects of 
military conflict, as well as to monitor 
significant political, legal, regulatory and 
other susceptible economic developments 
in these regions and attempt to mitigate 
our exposure where possible
	y
For suppliers based out of conflict-prone 
regions or at risk of geopolitical instability 
or having a high-risk exposure, we have 
taken measures including building up 
inventory, assessing alternate channels for 
supply of materials etc.
Negative
16
Data 
security, data 
privacy, and 
cybersecurity
Risk
Our business is dependent 
upon increasingly complex and 
interdependent information 
technology systems, including 
internet and cloud-based systems, 
to support our business processes. 
Our business is dependent on 
outsourcing and collaboration, 
which requires exchanging data 
and information. The size and 
complexity and interconnectivity of 
our computer systems make them 
potentially vulnerable to breakdown, 
malicious intrusion, computer 
viruses and other cyber-attacks.
We are subject to data privacy 
and security laws and regulations 
in many different jurisdictions and 
countries where we do business, 
and our or our partners’ failure 
to comply could result in fines, 
penalties, reputational damage, and 
could impact the way we operate our 
business.
	y
Our Information Security Management 
System (ISMS) is based on internationally 
recognised frameworks such as ISO 27001 
standard published by the International 
Organization for Standardization and the 
Cybersecutity Framework published by 
the U.S. National Institute of Standards 
and Technology. We use a comprehensive 
technology stack to implement the above 
control framework and carry out periodic 
independent assessments to review the 
effectiveness of these controls. Any gaps 
identified in the control framework 
goes through an established risk 
management process

Supply chain 
Risk
If there is delay and/or failure in 
supplies of materials, services, 
and finished goods from third 
parties or failure of finished goods 
from our manufacturing sites, it 
may adversely affect our business 
and operations.
We may experience difficulties, 
delays and interruptions in the 
manufacturing and supply of our 
products for various reasons, 
including supply chain disruptions, 
including those due to natural or 
man-made disasters at our facilities 
or at a critical supplier or vendor.
	y
We actively manage third-party 
relationships to ensure continuity of 
supplies and services on time and to our 
required specifications
	y
We utilise a broad base of suppliers 
in order to minimise risk arising from 
dependence on a single supplier

For each of our products, we continue to 
identify, upgrade, and develop alternate 
vendors as part of risk mitigation and 
continual improvement
	y
We are also conducting ESG assessment 
for our Strategic Suppliers. Based on the 
results of the evaluation, we will identify 
potential high-risk suppliers and 
develop a mitigation plan based on the 
risk classification
Negative
18
Product 
development
Risk
The manufacturing and development 
of our products is highly technical, 
lengthy, and complex, and 
dependent on several factors 
including the availability of raw 
materials, specialised manufacturing 
facilities, and qualified talent. There 
is also a high dependency on 
obtaining regulatory approvals at the 
right time and ensuring product and 
price competitiveness. A delay or 
inadequacy in either of these could 
cause a significant erosion in value, 
and impact our ability to deliver on 
our commercial priorities.
	y
We continuously seek to enhance our 
capabilities by up-skilling our people and 
hire the right talent
	y
We adopt new technologies to bring 
innovation and automate our processes for 
higher efficiency
	y
We amplify our research and development 
efforts through collaboration with partners 
and contract research organisations which 
have the capability to handle complex 
technologies and products

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases

the workplace, as appropriate. To protect the interest of complainant, we follow a strict non-retaliation policy, where 
any retaliation against an employee who in good faith raises concerns or who assists in an investigation of suspected 
wrongdoing, is not tolerated. Non-retaliation policy is applicable to all employees (including, but not limited to, all current 
and past employees, contract workers, part-time or temporary workforce) and third parties of the Company. A concern 
of potential retaliation can be raised through multiple reporting channels that are available and promoted across

reduction in carbon footprint, we have driven major projects around:
	
Air to sea shipment
	
Truck Loadability: With appropriate planning and management, we have optimised the utilisation of trucks resulting in a 
reduction of trips and overall carbon footprint
	
We encourage dedicated transporters to shift to low carbon fuels
