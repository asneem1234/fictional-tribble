Data Security 
& Customer

2.
Customers 
Literacy
Opportunity
Indians traditionally 
lean towards 
saving money 
and investing in 
secure instruments. 
However, increasing 
financial literacy can 
broaden horizons 
and provide 
new investment 
perspectives.
Educated customers 
provide valuable

of the elements of 
talent management 
can impact the 
Company’s ability to 
fulfil demand and 
grow its revenues. 
Poor employee 
well-being can 
result in increased 
absenteeism, 
decreased 
productivity, and 
higher healthcare 
costs. Lack of 
diversity and 
inclusion in the 
workplace can 
lead to difficulty 
attracting and 
retaining top talent.
The Company 
prioritizes robust 
people practices 
aimed at fostering 
overall employee 
growth. This includes 
health and wellbeing 
initiatives, adherence 
to fair pay norms, 
equal opportunity 
for all and extensive 
training programmes.

By focusing on human 
capital development, 
the Company can 
enhance operational 
efficiency and drive 
innovation.
Negative:

capital management 
can lead to higher
