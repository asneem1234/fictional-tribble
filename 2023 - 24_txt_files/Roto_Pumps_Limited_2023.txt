safeguards to mitigate, prevent and manage conflicts of interest that may arise. The Directors make a declaration every year, 
affirming compliance with the Code of Conduct.
	
In addition to provisions of the Companies Act, 2013, the Directors disclose their interest in the form of their other directorships/
memberships in other entities either directly or indirectly through their relatives. Such disclosures are being made to the Board 
annually and from time to time as and when such interest arises. We have established processes to identify the related parties of 
our Directors through their disclosures. If any transactions are conducted with these related parties, the Company strictly adheres 
to the disclosure requirements and procedures outlined in the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 
2015, as well as the Companies Act, 2013.

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your company 
to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
	
We have implemented specific initiatives to promote the principles of the 3R’s (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) for effective waste 
management. Hazardous waste is regularly disposed of through agencies authorised by the State Pollution Control Board. Our 
waste generation is well within the limits prescribed under the consent of the State Pollution Control Board (SPCB) or the Central 
Pollution Control Board (CPCB).
	
We have established dedicated procedures that align with ISO requirements and statutory obligations. These systems and processes 
are designed to minimise hazardous waste generation, and they undergo internal audits twice a year, as well as annual external 
audits conducted by an authorised agency. By maintaining a sound waste management system, we go beyond mere compliance 
with state regulations.
	
Our waste management approach involves comprehensive monitoring of hazardous and non-hazardous waste generation streams 
at each plant. Waste is segregated and stored separately in designated waste management sheds. Disposal of waste follows the 
prescribed conditions set by the State Pollution Control Board. Moreover, organic waste generated in our kitchens are utilised to 
derive energy.
	
Through these measures, we demonstrate our commitment to responsible waste management and environmental sustainability.
10. 	 If the entity has operations/offices in/around ecologically sensitive areas (such as national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, biosphere

Describe the mechanisms to receive and redress grievances of the community.
	
We have implemented a well-defined process to receive and address concerns and grievances from the community. At the site 
level, a committee is formed comprising members from different functions such as administration, security, HR, and others. This 
committee is responsible for receiving concerns, whether in written or verbal form, and diligently working towards their resolution. 
To ensure a thorough investigation and resolution, joint field visits are conducted, and the concerns are appropriately addressed 
in a timely manner. Throughout this process, the concerns are documented, recorded, and actively tracked to ensure closure and 
satisfactory resolution. In addition, we proactively engage with the community as a part of the development work. Throughout the 
year, a number of informal and formal sessions are conducted which help interactions with the community apart from program 
specific meetings to facilitate working together. There is a targeted approach for engaging with various sections viz. youth, women, 
and community leaders. Senior leadership interacts with the community regularly.
