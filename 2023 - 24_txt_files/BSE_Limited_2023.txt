Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report

About BRSR
The Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) is a framework developed by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to promote 
responsible and sustainable business practices among listed companies in India. Introduced in 2021, the BRSR builds upon the earlier Business 
Responsibility Reporting (BRR) framework and aims to enhance the quality and comprehensiveness of ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) 
disclosures.
The BRSR framework requires the top 1,000 listed companies (by market capitalization) on Indian stock exchanges to report their ESG-related information 
in a structured manner. It encompasses a wide range of parameters, including environmental impact, social initiatives, governance practices, stakeholder 
engagement, and business ethics. The objective is to provide stakeholders with a holistic view of a company's sustainability performance and its 
contribution to the overall well-being of society.
Under the BRSR, companies are required to disclose relevant ESG information in their annual reports or through a separate sustainability report. The 
framework encourages companies to adopt a strategic approach towards sustainability, integrate ESG considerations into their business models, and align 
their practices with internationally recognized frameworks and principles.
Executive Summary
BSE is committed to upholding the principles of Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) framework, mandated by the Securities and 
Exchange Board of India (SEBI), for the top 1,000 listed companies in India. BSE views BRSR reporting not merely as a regulatory requirement but as an 
integral part of its corporate ethos, recognizing the significant role of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors in today's business environment. 
By adhering to BRSR, BSE actively demonstrates its dedication to transparency and sustainability, acknowledging the importance of comprehensive ESG 
reporting for investors, stakeholders, and society as a whole. 
BSE diligently follows the guiding principles of the BRSR framework. Adhering to the first principle, it has implemented robust policies such as Whistle 
Blower policy, Codes of Ethics for Directors and Key Management Personnel, and a comprehensive Ethical Code of Conduct for all employees, underscoring 
its commitment to integrity, transparency, and accountability. Moreover, BSE's procurement strategy exemplifies its dedication to principle two, prioritizing 
safety and minimizing resource consumption.
In line with principle three, BSE fosters an inclusive workplace environment, providing facilities for differently abled individuals and promoting ethical 
conduct and open dialogue among employees. Comprehensive employee benefits, including medical insurance and health and wellness programs, 
contribute to employee well-being. Pursuant to principle four, stakeholder engagement is a priority for BSE, with various communication channels available 
for stakeholders to provide input on economic, environmental, and social issues. The company actively addresses shareholder queries and maintains a 
dedicated CSR & ESG committee to fulfil its societal responsibilities.
Embodying principle five, BSE integrates human rights awareness into its employee induction program and upholds policies against sexual harassment 
and for grievance redressal, ensuring the fair treatment of all individuals within the organization. With respect to principle six, environmental sustainability 
is a key focus for BSE, with initiatives such as rainwater harvesting, energy conservation measures, and plastic bottle recycling at its Mumbai facilities.
In terms of principle seven, BSE collaborates with trade and industry chambers to positively influence regulatory policies. Addressing principle eight, BSE 
has demonstrated its commitment to inclusive growth through its CSR initiatives. Notably, contributions to the Prime Minister's National Relief Fund aid 
the public indiscriminately, and support for the Indian Cancer Society has directly affected individuals in need. Fulfilling principle nine, BSE prioritizes 
responsible customer engagement through comprehensive policies on cybersecurity and data privacy, as well as investor protection measures such as 
the Investor Protection Fund. The company also champions financial literacy among investors, extending educational outreach to college and university 
students.
Overall, BSE's adherence to the BRSR framework reflects its steadfast dedication to operating as a socially responsible, inclusive, and transparent 
organization, contributing to sustainable development within the parameters of BRSR.
Note: The numbers are rationalised in this year’s BRSR, wherever required.

Outsourcing Risks
Risk
Risk arising from failure or delay in providing the 
services from outsourced partners/vendors and 
high attrition of vendor staff could result into delay/
non-compliance with regulatory requirements.
Vendor service level agreements are designed in a way 
to include regulatory compliance requirements, sufficient 
resources in reserves on vendor side are ensured to meet 
exigencies or immediate requirements from regulators.
The monitoring of the outsourced functions are supervised 
by BSE IT Management Team and vendor staff is stationed 
at BSE premises only.
Once a vendor has been on-boarded, risk assessments are 
performed to minimize any operational, regulatory, strategic, 
cybersecurity and financial risk. These risk assessments are 
carried out based on industry best standards, regulatory 
and legal requirements. Vendors are required to handle and 
secure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the 
organization’s information. As part of vendor monitoring, SLA 
monitoring, vendor performance management and periodic 
review meetings are also conducted.

Physical building security
Risk
BSE is one of the few public institutions of 
national importance in India. It is synonymous with 
development of capital markets and investments 
in India. Considering its significance to the 
economy and people of India, it was the BSE 
building which was the first place of attack in the 
1993 serial bomb blasts resulting in 84 casualties 
and hundreds of injuries. Since then, BSE has 
continuously been on heightened risk of another 
terror attack based on intelligence inputs.
Bollards/Crash Barriers are installed at 5 approach points to 
prevent vehicle from reaching the BSE premises. No vehicles 
(except essential services vehicles like Police, Cash Van, 
Ambulance etc.) are permitted to enter BSE premises. The 
BSE building is guarded by 4 levels of security including 
BSE’s personnel security and Mumbai Police. Periodical 
joint mock drills are carried out by Mumbai Police, Special 
Commandos and SRPF along with BSE security guards. 
Decoy attempts are carried out by Mumbai Police to check 
alertness of BSE security guards.
Negative
8.
Investor Protection
Opportunity
We believe, investor education and awareness are 
the key to the wealth and financial wellbeing of the 
investors. Protecting the interest of the investors 
dealing in securities is one of the main objectives 
of BSE. The capital market can grow only when 
investors find it safe for them to invest and they 
are assured that the rules governing the market 
are fair and just to all the players.
 The grievances of investors against listed companies and 
BSE Trading Members are redressed by BSE. BSE also 
assists in the arbitration process both, between Trading 
Members inter-se and between Trading Members and 
non - Trading Members. With a view to ensure speedy and 
effective resolution of claims, differences, and disputes 
between Trading Members inter-se and between Trading 
Members and non - Trading Members, BSE has laid down 
a set of procedures for arbitration thereof. These procedures 
are duly embodied in the Rules, Byelaws and Regulations of 
BSE, which have been duly approved by the Government of 
India / Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).

10. Net worth Adequacy, Liquidity 
and Credit Risk 
Risk
Inadequate Net worth and Liquidity may pose 
Risk to continuity and survival of the organization. 
Excessive Credit Risk may result in value erosion 
of the Financial Assets of the Company.
BSE has to satisfy the Minimum Net worth requirements at all 
times as mandated by the Securities Contracts (Regulation) 
(Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporations) Regulations, 
2018. This ensures the minimum capital Adequacy. 
Additionally Investment book of BSE has well diversified 
highly rated good quality portfolio which avoids credit Risk 
and Liquidity Risks. 
Negative
11. Critical 
Skill, 
Resource 
Management and Succession 
Planning
Risk
The HR function needs to provide timely resources 
with the required skill sets as well as retain the 
right talent. Failure to do so may cause productivity 
issues and affect the Organizational performance. 
 
Robust Succession Planning strategy needs to 
be in place to overcome the leadership vacuum 
situations anytime in the organization.
With BSE’s strong empanelment of headhunting and 
recruiting agencies and subscription to job portals, talent 
acquisition process becomes objective and fast paced so 
as to cater emerging skill requirements for businesses. 
For entry level skills requirements, campus hiring is 
done by collaborating with various business schools. 
Apart from this BSE conducts various in house and external 
training programs for the skill development of existing workforce. 
 
There is succession policy in place which is approved by 
Nomination and Remuneration committee. The attrition 
level details are presented to NRC and Board every quarter. 
 
BSE’s strong retention strategies help to retain the key 
managerial personnel & senior position employees. 
Negative
12. Market Resilience
Risk & 
Opportunity
BSE stands to draw a larger pool of investors and 
traders, thereby augmenting trading volumes 
and transaction revenues. Confidence in the 
exchanges’ integrity and transparency fosters 
increased market participation, driving revenue 
generation for the exchange.
A resilient market diminishes the probability of abrupt 
market downturns or disturbances, mitigating the potential 
for significant financial repercussions for both the exchange 
and its participants.

fostering inclusive workplaces, upholding human rights, and engaging in fair business practices. By adhering to these principles, we aim to create long-term value not 
only for our shareholders but for society at large.
Looking ahead, we remain steadfast in our dedication to advancing our ESG agenda. We will continue to innovate, collaborate, and evolve our strategies to address 
emerging challenges and opportunities. By staying true to our ESG commitments, we aspire to be a beacon of sustainable business excellence, driving positive change 
and leaving a lasting legacy for generations to come.

Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity.
	
Identifying key stakeholder groups is a critical aspect of effective stakeholder management for any entity. The process involves several steps aimed 
at comprehensively identifying and understanding the various parties with a vested interest in the organization’s activities, decisions, and outcomes.
a.	
Stakeholder Mapping: The first step in the process is to conduct stakeholder mapping, wherein stakeholders are identified based on their 
level of influence and interest in the organization. This involves categorizing stakeholders into different groups based on factors such as their 
relationship with the entity, their degree of influence, and their potential impact on the organization’s objectives.
b.	
Stakeholder Analysis: Once stakeholders are identified, a thorough analysis is conducted to understand their needs, expectations, and concerns. 
This involves gathering information through stakeholder consultations, surveys, interviews, and other forms of engagement to gain insights into 
their perspectives and priorities.
c.	
Prioritization: Stakeholders are then prioritized based on their level of importance to the organization and the potential impact of their 
engagement. Key criteria for prioritization may include the degree of influence they wield, the extent of their dependence on the organization, 
and the potential risks associated with their interests.
d.	
Engagement Planning: With key stakeholders identified and prioritized, the next step is to develop an engagement plan outlining how the 
organization will interact with each stakeholder group. This involves defining objectives, determining communication channels, and establishing 
mechanisms for ongoing dialogue and feedback.

Continuous Monitoring and Review: The process of identifying key stakeholders is not static and requires continuous monitoring and review.

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases.
	
Preventing adverse consequences to complainants in discrimination and harassment cases is paramount to fostering a safe and inclusive work

The protection mechanisms include:
a.	
Confidential Reporting Channels: Providing confidential avenues for reporting discrimination and harassment cases encourages individuals to 
come forward without fear of reprisal.
b.	
Non-Retaliation Policies: Implementing robust non-retaliation policies is essential to safeguarding complainants from adverse actions or 
treatment following the filing of a complaint. These policies make it clear that retaliation against individuals who report discrimination or 
harassment will not be tolerated and will be subject to disciplinary action.
c.	
Whistle-blower Protections: Ensuring that complainants are protected under whistle-blower laws and policies reinforces their rights and shields 
them from retaliation. Whistle-blower protections may include legal safeguards, anonymity provisions, and mechanisms for reporting retaliation.
d.	
Supportive Environment: Creating a supportive environment for complainants is crucial for their well-being and confidence in the reporting
