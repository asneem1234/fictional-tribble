Changing consumer preferenc-

discontinuation of certain vehi-

on the existing business model, 
cost to company.
the demand of the consumers, 
we have undertaken process 
improvement and invested into 
development of new products. 
We are in the process of auto-
mating product manufacturing 
processes which will lead to 
development of new products

panding in newer geographies 
and penetrating newer seg-
ments to stay competitive in 
the industry and abreast with 
latest technology.
Development of new-
er models with latest 
technology and in line 
with 
customers’ 
de-
mand will result in at-
tracting of new custom-

the existing customers. 
This will result in the 
increased revenue and

Changes in 
technology
Risk
Shifting demand for more sus-
tainable alternatives,- there is 
an increased demand for electric 
vehicles. Increasing usage of 
electric vehicles in commercial 
the Company.
We are rapidly transforming 
our processes and adapting by 
developing products which are 
agnostic to the type of engine 
used in the vehicle. The Com-
pany is also vigorously working 
on new product development 
for manufacture of products for 
electric and hybrid vehicles.
Due to increasing us-
age of electric vehicles, 
there is a risk of reduc-

Procurement of 
raw materials

Risk
Raw materials are the most im-
portant component in the pro-
duction of goods. Procurement 
of raw materials are subject to 
market volatility, resulting from 
supply chain disruptions, in-
increase in the price. We rely on 
a network of suppliers across 
various geographies to source 
raw materials, and various parts 
used in the manufacturing of 
bearings. Supply chain disrup-
tion may adversely impact the 
total production volume, loss of 
revenue, increased cost, loss of 
-
ity. Moreover, since our suppliers 
are spread across various ge-
ographies, ongoing geopolitical 
commodity price stability along 
with various regulatory restric-
We ensure optimal supply of 
goods and services, focusing 
on quality, cost and delivery 
performance. Multiple product 
sourcing and localisation op-
tions are continuously explored. 
By negotiating prices and utilis-
ing economic synergies, we are 
largely able to obtain competi-
tive prices. We also analyse the 
operations of our suppliers, by 
deploying dedicated personnel 
performing quality checks, for 
early signs of distress so that 
interven tions can be made to 
secure its interests. Represen-
tations are made to relevant 
authorities to ensure timely 
clearance of import consign-
ments
Fluctuations
