1
Energy 
and GHG 
Emissions 
Manage-
ment
Opportu-
nity
Assessing the environmental im-
pact of the company's operations 
and effectively managing energy 
and fuel consumption is crucial. If 
these risks are not properly man-
aged, they could negatively affect 
operations and profitability, at-
tract scrutiny from stakeholders 
and investors, and influence public 
perception of the company. Mon-
itoring and regularly reporting on 
these efforts will demonstrate the 
company's commitment to sustain-
ability and responsible resource 
management. As regulatory and 
compliance demands related to 
climate change become more strin-
gent, the business needs to adjust 
to evolving standards by making 
necessary investments.
-
Positive: Managing GHG 
emissions 
enables 
the 
company to reduce oper-
ational costs through en-
ergy efficiency measures, 
invest in low-carbon sys-
tems, foster sustainability, 
and achieve market dif-
ferentiation. Additionally, 
it attracts eco-conscious 
clients and investors, and 
helps mitigate regulatory 
risks and potential fines 
related to environmental 
compliance. Investments 
in energy and emissions 
management systems and 
technologies 
influence 
our financials, which we 
recognize as a key aspect 
of our strategic approach 
to sustainability and regu-
latory compliance.
2
Sustainable 
Product
Opportu-
nity
By adopting sustainable products 
such as green steel, the company 
can tap into the increasing demand 
for sustainable products, attracting 
environmentally conscious custom-
ers and industries. This not only en-
hances market differentiation but 
also aligns the company with evolv-
ing regulatory standards that prior-
itize lower carbon emissions. Addi-
tionally, using sustainable products 
can bolster the company’s brand 
reputation as a leader in sustain-
ability, which can lead to stronger 
customer loyalty and investor inter-
est. Moreover, it opens up oppor-
tunities for innovation in product 
development, allowing the compa-
ny to create advanced, eco-friendly 
pipe and tube solutions that meet 
the needs of a greener economy.
-
Positive: Venturing into 
sustainable 
products 
can lead to higher profit 
margins by tapping into 
premium markets and at-
tracting environmentally 
conscious customers. It 
can also result in cost sav-
ings through regulatory 
incentives, reduced car-
bon taxes and improved 
energy efficiency.

Product 
innovation, 
safety, and 
quality
Risk
Issues related to product innova-
tion, quality, and safety can greatly 
affect our capacity to meet cus-
tomer demand and create value for 
stakeholders. Failures in these areas 
may result in reputational harm, 
loss of market share and potential 
legal liabilities.
Quality Manage-
ment Systems are 
in place certified 
by APIQR. The 
company is ISO 
9001:2015, ISO 
29001:2020, ISO 
14001: 2015, ISO /
IEC 17025: 2017, 
ISO 3834-2:2021, 
ISO 3183:2019 and 
ISO 27001:2013 
certified. 
Negative: Lapses in prod-
uct innovation, quality, 
and safety can lead to 
significant revenue loss 
and increased costs from 
recalls and repairs. They 
may also result in market 
share erosion, legal liabili-
ties, and diminished brand 
value.
4
Occu-
pational 
Health and 
Safety
Risk
Occupational health and safety 
incidents 
present 
regulatory 
and reputational risks while also 
jeopardizing business continuity 
and employee well-being. Non-
compliance can negatively impact 
operational efficiency and hinder 
our ability to meet customer 
demands.
Safety training 
programs and 
safety audits are 
conducted.
Negative: Although main-
taining safety standards 
and investing in safety 
technology and training 
involves costs, employee 
safety remains the top 
priority. The financial ad-
vantages of uninterrupt-
ed operations far exceed 
these costs, ensuring both 
workforce protection and 
operational continuity.
5
Supply 
Chain Man-
agement
Opportu-
nity
The current global conflicts and 
instability have notably disrupted 
supply chains, creating an opportu-
nity for us to innovate and develop 
alternative supply chain models. 
This strategic approach helps us 
manage uncertainties, gain a mar-
ket advantage, and optimize pro-
duction costs. Additionally, there is 
an increasing need to assess suppli-
ers based on ESG criteria.
-
Positive: Implementing a 
strong supply chain man-
agement strategy boosts 
operational efficiency and 
enhances customer satis-
faction, fostering sustain-
able business growth and 
profitability.
6
Employee 
Benefits & 
Develop-
ment
Opportu-
nity
This boosts efficiency, reduces 
employee 
attrition, 
increases 
capabilities and creativity within the 
company, and enhances diversity, 
thereby improving the customer 
experience. Additionally, it fosters 
a more inclusive and innovative 
workplace culture.
-
Positive: A strong work-
force with high engage-
ment, 
retention 
rates, 
and diversity brings new 
perspectives, experiences, 
and ideas, fostering in-
novation and enhancing 
performance. This positive 
culture not only boosts or-
ganizational performance 
but also underscores the 
company's 
commitment 
to creating a conducive 
work environment.

Systematic 
Risk Man-
agement
Risk 
This ensures financial stability, reg-
ulatory compliance, and stakehold-
er protection. It facilitates business 
continuity, 
reputation 
manage-
ment, and long-term sustainability 
by effectively identifying, assess-
ing, and mitigating potential risks. 
These risks may arise from financial, 
technological, or lending sources, 
with the potential to undermine or 
jeopardize the stability of the over-
all system.
The Company has 
a risk management 
framework for the 
identification and 
management 
of 
risks. The Company 
has been follow-
ing the processes 
and procedures for 
assessment 
and 
mitigation of vari-
ous business risks 
associated with the 
nature of its op-
erations and such 
adaptation 
has 
helped the Com-
pany to a very large 
extent. In line with 
the 
requirement 
under the SEBI List-
ing 
Regulations, 
the Company has 
constituted a Risk 
Management Com-
mittee (RMC) com-
prising of members 
of the Board and 
Senior 
Manage-
ment 
personnel. 
Composition 
of 
RMC is provided in 
the Corporate Gov-
ernance 
Report, 
which forms part 
of this Report. RMC 
is entrusted with 
the 
responsibility 
of overseeing stra-
tegic, 
operational 
and financial risks 
that the organisa-
tion faces, along 
with the adequa-
cy of mitigation 
plans to address 
such risks. The ul-
timate 
responsi-
bility for framing, 
implementing and 
monitoring the risk 
management plan 
for the Company 
lies on the Board of 
Directors.
Negative: Failure to ad-
dress unmitigated risks 
that could escalate into 
systemic risks may have 
detrimental effects on the 
company's performance. 
These risks threaten the 
stability and integrity of 
the financial system, po-
tentially leading to disrup-
tions, financial losses, and 
reputational damage.

Regulatory 
& Legal 
Complianc-
es
Risk
Non-compliance risks expose the 
company to legal penalties and 
financial losses due to failure to 
adhere to industry laws and regula-
tions. Such non-compliance direct-
ly impacts the company's revenue 
and valuations, leading to loss of 
reputation and business opportu-
nities. Conversely, companies with 
higher compliance levels often 
demonstrate better performance 
and process efficiency, as compli-
ance offers assurance and valuable 
insights to investors.
The Company has 
a Code of Conduct 
for business and 
ethics, a policy & 
guidelines on sex-
ual harassment of 
employees 
and 
vigil 
mechanism/
whistle blower pol-
icy which covers 
aspects 
ensuring 
human rights of 
its employees. Ad-
herence to these 
policies are expect-
ed from everyone 
dealing with the 
Company.
Negative: 
Non-compli-
ance can result in repu-
tational damage, which 
in turn negatively affects 
business activities. This 
may result in monetary 
fines to more severe mea-
sures, such as operational 
restrictions or legal pro-
ceedings.
9
ESG 
Oversight
Opportu-
nity
Effective ESG oversight at the board 
level will enhance the compa-
ny's overall ESG performance and 
demonstrate its commitment to 
integrating responsible business 
practices into its growth model. 
Integrating ESG into business prac-
tices will improve risk management, 
governance, accountability, report-
ing, and decision-making. It will 
also strengthen the ability to iden-
tify and manage risks and opportu-
nities related to environmental and 
social impact, while building trust 
and transparency among investors 
and stakeholders.
-
Positive: Leadership over-
sight of the ESG strategy, 
action plan, and perfor-
mance fosters a positive 
impact on the environ-
ment and community. It 
also enables the company 
to embed robust moni-
toring mechanisms across 
ESG initiatives and busi-
ness practices. Looking 
ahead, ESG will be the cor-
nerstone of the company's 
financial success, competi-
tive advantage, and future 
accomplishments.

employees, and the communities we serve, while driving sustainable 
growth and innovation.
We are currently developing relevant policies, procedures and a detailed
