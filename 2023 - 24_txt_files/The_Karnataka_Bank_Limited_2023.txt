iii. 
To calculate the CO2 GHG emission using Equation A-1 in 40 CFR Part 98, the Bank has used both Petrol and Diesel type 
of fuel for its staff transport, travelling operations and the share of proportion is not calculated at present in FY 2023-24. 
Referring to default values for EFi and OFi for various types of fuel in Table C-1 and Table C-2 of Subpart C of Part 981 
average of the corresponding emission factor and oxidation factor for that fuel and. Equation A-1 prescribed therein 
 
 
where:
 
 
CO2 is the carbon dioxide emission in metric tons; EFi is the carbon dioxide emission factor for fuel type i in kg CO2/TJ; 
OFi is the oxidation factor for fuel type i (dimensionless); FCi is the amount of fuel type i consumed in TJ; and i is the fuel 
type. Working calculation Scope 1* : 
 
 
Fuel consumed is petrol, then EFi=69,300 kg CO2/TJ and OFi=0.99. If the fuel consumed is diesel, then EFi=74,100 kg CO2/
TJ and OFi=0.99. If the fuel consumption is 0.24 TJ in FY 2023-24, then the CO2 GHG emission is:
 
 
c) 
Average of both since proportion share is not available assumed as *17 Metric Tonnes CO2 
 
iv. 
To calculate the CO2 GHG emission based on purchased electricity to run its 900+branches, DigiCenters, data centre, a 
consolidated electricity bill data is gathered by the Bank at present. 
 
 
Using the Equation A-1 in 40 CFR Part 98 GHG, we are assuming purchased electricity as type and based on electricity 
 
 
where: 
 
 
CO2 is the carbon dioxide emission in metric tons; EFi is the carbon dioxide emission factor for electricity system i in kg 
CO2/TJ; OFi is the oxidation factor for electricity system i (dimensionless);
 
 
FCi is the amount of electricity from system i consumed in TJ; and i is the electricity system.
 
 
Working Calculation Scope 2: **
 
 
the electricity consumption is 21.55 TJ, then the CO2 GHG emission is:
