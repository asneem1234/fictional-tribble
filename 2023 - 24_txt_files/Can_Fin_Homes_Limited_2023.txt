Data Security
Risk
Safeguarding customer 
information from 
cyberattacks and data 
breaches is vital. Any 
breach can result in 
severe consequences, 
such as identity theft 
and financial loss for 
customers. Neglecting 
this issue could lead 
to reputational harm, 
financial risks, and 
regulatory non-
compliance.
Embracing cutting-edge 
technology and setting up 
a round-the-clock Security 
Operation Centre (SOC) 
is key to detecting and 
countering cyber threats. 
Collaborations with 
secure server providers 
who comply with data 
security standards are 
also crucial. Moreover, 
the implementation of 
a robust governance 
framework and stringent 
information security 
practices fortifies the 
security landscape.
Negative: Potential data 
breaches can lead to 
significant costs, including 
investigation expenses, 
customer notifications, legal 
fees, and regulatory fines. 
Operational disruptions 
may result in productivity 
loss and potential customer 
departure. In addition, there 
is a concern about legal and 
regulatory repercussions, 
such as penalties and 
investigations. Enhanced 
cybersecurity measures 
may require additional 
investments.
2
Energy 
Management
Risk
Prioritizing energy 
consumption in 
sustainability strategies 
is crucial. Neglecting 
this could lead to 
increased energy 
costs, environmental 
consequences, and 
regulatory non-
compliance.
Can Fin Homes recognizes 
the importance of 
managing energy and is 
actively measuring energy 
usage. This includes 
implementing energy 
monitoring systems and 
exploring energy-saving 
technologies. By tracking 
energy consumption, Can 
Fin Homes can identify 
areas for improvement 
and develop strategies 
to reduce energy use, 
cut costs, and minimize 
environmental impact.
Negative: Escalating 
energy expenses may 
increase operational costs 
and reduce profitability. 
However, implementing 
energy efficiency strategies 
can lead to cost savings and 
improve long-term financial 
performance.

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases. 
	
CFHL is dedicated to create a workplace environment that is free from harassment, with a specific focus on eradicating all 
forms of sexual harassment. The Company encourages employees to report any harassment concerns, and it promptly 
addresses any complaints related to harassment or unwelcome, offensive behavior.
	
The Company has established an Internal Complaint Committee with the specific goal of preventing instances of 
discrimination and harassment targeting women. Regular awareness and training sessions are conducted to ensure 
that employees are well-informed about the various aspects of sexual harassment and the available complaint 
redressal mechanisms.
	
Can Fin Homes adheres to an Equal Opportunity policy and is committed to treating all employees and job applicants 
with fairness and equality. Any discrimination or harassment based on gender, race, religion, age, or any other protected 
characteristic is strictly prohibited and will not be tolerated.
	
Additionally, CFHL has established an Internal Complaints Committee specifically tasked with addressing complaints 
related to Prevention of Sexual Harassment (POSH) in the workplace. This committee ensures a safe and respectful 
working environment for all employees. 
       Moreover, CFHL has implemented a whistle blower policy, and as part of its Vigil Mechanism, employees are provided 
with a dedicated email address, speak.up@canfinhomes.com, to report any concerns or grievances they may have. This 
mechanism allows employees to come forward with confidence, knowing that their concerns will be addressed in a fair 
and confidential manner.
9.	
Do human rights requirements form part of your business agreements and contracts? (Yes/No) 
	
No, Given the nature of CFHL’s operations, the scope of human rights requirements outlined in its business agreements 
and contracts is relatively limited. It is important to emphasize that while CFHL does not have a specific policy solely 
dedicated to human rights, it upholds a strict prohibition on any form of forced or compulsory labor, child labor, and 
discrimination against employees based on various factors including nationality, color, origin, ideology, religion, race, 
caste, creed, trade union or political activity, sexual orientation, age, sex, illness, disability, pregnancy, or any medical 
condition. This commitment to upholding human rights is integral to CFHL’s business practices.

efforts towards environmental sustainability.
