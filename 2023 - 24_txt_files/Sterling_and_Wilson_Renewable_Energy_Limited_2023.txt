 Statement by the director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, 
targets and achievements
 
 I want to emphasize our unwavering commitment to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles. We understand 
that the renewable energy sector, while critical in combating climate change, faces its own set of ESG challenges. These include 
environmental concerns like land-use impact and responsible waste management, social issues like ensuring fair labor 
practices throughout the supply chain and community engagement, and strong corporate governance with transparency and 
anti-corruption measures. SWREL has set and is actively pursuing ambitious ESG targets. We’re committed to increasing land-use 
efficiency by 15% by 2027 through innovative design and collaboration with conservation groups. We’ve already achieved a 
20% reduction in construction and maintenance waste compared to 2022. On the social front, a comprehensive supplier code 
of conduct with regular audits ensures fair labor practices. Our community development programs have demonstrably improved 
livelihoods around project sites, exceeding initial engagement targets. We’ve bolstered our anti-corruption framework with 
employee training and a whistleblower hotline, and achieved a 100% board evaluation completion rate. We acknowledge 
that the journey towards ESG leadership is continuous. We’ll keep setting ambitious targets, fostering open dialogue with 
stakeholders, and continuously improving our ESG performance. We believe that by working together with all stakeholders, we 
can build a sustainable future powered by clean energy. This report provides a deeper understanding of our ESG efforts, and we 
welcome your feedback and collaboration to accelerate the transition towards a sustainable energy future.

8. 
Does the entity have any project related to reducing greenhouse gas emissions? If yes, then provide details.
 
 We are actively engaged in projects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We conserve energy by utilizing prefabricated 
system components, which minimizes the need for power tools and eliminates the use of Diesel Generators (DG) at our sites. 
Our solar plant lighting designs rely on LED technology, significantly reducing energy consumption. Additionally, we treat 
on-site sewage water for dust control purposes.
 
 To utilize alternate energy sources, we electrify our site offices with solar-powered inverters, reducing our dependence on 
DGs. We employ semi/fully automatic robots for PV module cleaning, which substantially cuts water and electricity usage. 
Solar lighting is also used for auxiliary consumption during the night.
 
 We have made significant capital investments in energy conservation equipment, including a mobile testing lab for PV 
modules. This facility allows us to test module performance on-site, improving testing efficiency and conserving energy that 
would otherwise be spent on logistics and transportation.

2021, entered into by the Company with Shapoorji Pallonji 
and Company Private Limited, Khurshed Yazdi Daruvala 
(jointly the “Promoter Selling Shareholders”) and Reliance 
New Energy Limited (formerly known as Reliance New 
Energy Solar Limited) pursuant to which, the Promoter 
Selling Shareholders would indemnify and re-imburse the 
Company and its subsidiaries / branches for a net amount, 
on settlement of liquidated damages pertaining to certain 
identified past and existing projects (as on the date of 
signing the aforementioned agreement), old receivables, 
direct and indirect tax litigations as well as certain legal 
and regulatory matters, if such claims (net of receivables) 
exceeds ` 300.00 crores. Consequently, trade receivables 
from the customer undergoing a resolution process under 
the supervision of the National Company Law Tribunal 
(‘NCLT’) and bank guarantees related to liquidated 
damages encashed by certain customers would also be 
recoverable from the Promoter Selling Shareholders once 
crystallized, if not recovered from the customers. Since all 
future crystallized claims beyond ` 300.00 crores will be 
fully charged back and recovered from the Promoter Selling 
Shareholders, there will be no further impact on the results 
of the Company.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of these matters.
