1.
Management 
of the 
Legal and 
Regulatory 
Environment 
Compliances
Risk
The Chemical industry 
faces strict regulation 
governing air emissions, 
water discharge, chemical 
safety, and process 
safety, among other 
issues. Anticipating and 
adapting to regulatory 
developments, both in 
the short and long term, 
is a critical issue for the 
industry, as regulatory 
developments can 
significantly affect product 
demand, manufacturing 
costs, and brand value.
In order to mitigate the risk 
attached to Current and emerging 
regulations, the organisation has 
EHS representatives responsible for 
each facility for understanding and 
reporting on local regulatory activity 
and they are responsible for all air 
permitting, air quality reporting, 
water permitting, wastewater 
quality reporting and ensuring 
the facility is ready for any new 
regulations. Organisation also is an 
active participant in local industries 
associations where information 
related to change in regulation 
is being shared with members. 
Further, we manage this risk through 
assessments of potential risks and 
backup plans to continue production 
in the cases of disruptions to raw 
material sources, manufacturing 
sites, and even the distribution 
process.
Negative
2.
Employee 
Health & 
Safety
Risk
Employees in chemicals 
manufacturing facilities 
face health and safety 
risks from exposure 
to heavy machinery, 
harmful substances, 
high temperatures and 
pressure, and electrical 
hazards, among others. 
Creating an effective 
safety culture is critical to 
proactively mitigate safety 
impacts, which could result 
in financial consequences, 
including higher healthcare 
costs, litigation, and work 
disruption.
The organisation being Chemical 
industry has already identified 
the risk associated with the same 
and thereby has strict policy and 
guidelines regulating health and 
safety of its employees. Safety 
is one of the five core values of 
our organisation & hence gets 
top management focus. The 
organisation endeavours to 
maintain a safe work environment 
and promote a culture of safety 
thereby minimising safety-related 
expenses and potentially improving 
productivity. The Company also 
provides insurance facilities to its 
employees as a compensating 
measure in case of any health 
hazard.

Climatic 
Effects
Risk
There are high chances of 
production/ operational 
activities getting affected 
in case of extreme weather 
events such as cyclones 
and floods, heatwave etc. 
The Company, having 
vast area coverage of its 
operations has two such 
manufacturing locations in 
India. One is Mahad plant 
(prone to heavy rains) and 
other is Jhagadia plant 
(prone to Cyclone/ dry 
climate), apart from this we 
have dedicated third party 
manufactures in two other 
states of India.
Organisation has invested 
safeguarding of electrical and 
instrumentation systems (for 
flood protection) and other critical 
facilities. In order to prevent impact 
of such scenario, company has 
implemented proactive measures 
to tackle flood related emergency 
and climate conditions. Further, 
we have covered such instances in 
our insurance policy. In addition to 
this, we have kept our third-party 
manufacturers ready as backup 
in case of emergency. The entire 
emergency response team of 
the organisation was trained in 
handling flood emergency by the 
local National Disaster Management 
team.
Negative

GHG 
Emissions
Risk
Chemical manufacturing 
generates direct (Scope 
1) greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions from the 
combustion of fossil fuels 
in manufacturing and 
cogeneration processes, 
as well as process 
emissions from the 
chemical transformation of 
feedstocks.
The organisation with the legacy of 
responsible innovation, continues 
to develop ways in order to reduce 
emission. Since we proactively 
discloses its details related to 
emission via CDP and EcoVadis, it 
helps us innovate and better utilise 
our alternate means of energy which 
further helps us to reduce GHG 
emissions.
Negative
5
GHG 
Emissions
Opportunity
Since the organisation 
is ahead of the curve in 
researching reporting and 
reducing the fatal aspects 
of its emissions and 
effluents, it is able to better 
manage its hazardous 
waste and other waste 
with a visible positive 
impact on financial and 
non-financial aspects.

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24
The Company has invested in renewable energy sources to reduce dependency on fossil fuels and reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions (GHG) e.g. Solar power projects (0.4 MW roof top & 10 MW through open access are already installed & 
commissioned in 2023-24) and other energy solutions like use of biomass and biofuel, transition to Electric Vehicles (EVs) 
company-owned, for employee travel. The Company has also focussed on improving energy efficiency in manufacturing 
processes by adopting advanced technologies, optimising equipment efficiencies and implementing energy management 
systems. The Company is implementing interventions such as solar projects, waste generation reduction and waste 
heat recovery. The Company has implemented systems to monitor and measure greenhouse gas emissions across its 
operations for identifying areas for improvement and drive a continuous reduction in emissions. The Company supports 
research and development initiatives aimed at developing new technologies and processes that reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions to fulfil its Science Based Targets commitment for Net Zero by 2050.

The Effluent Treatment Plants (ETP) of each unit is equipped with primary, secondary, tertiary treatment followed by 
Reverse Osmosis (RO) system. Tertiary treated effluent is either recycled through RO or discharged to the common 
effluent system. The Aqueous effluent generated from processes having low COD and high TDS is fed to the Multiple 
Effect Evaporator (MEE) along with the RO reject, and condensate of the evaporator is sent for treatment in the Effluent 
treatment plant or recycled/reused. The sludge generated from the evaporator/ETP is sent to an authorised secured 
landfill site. High calorific and high TDS value hazardous waste is sent for processing to authorised co-processors and 
further to cement industry.
