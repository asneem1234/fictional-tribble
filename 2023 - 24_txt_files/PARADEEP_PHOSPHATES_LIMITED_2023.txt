24.	 Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues
Please indicate material responsible business conduct and sustainability issues pertaining to environmental and social 
matters that present a risk or an opportunity to your business, rationale for identifying the same, approach to adapt or 
mitigate the risk along-with its financial implications, as per the following format:
S.

opportunity
Rationale for 
identifying the risk / 
opportunity
In case of risk, approach to adapt 
or mitigate
Financial implications of 
the risk or opportunity 
(Indicate positive or 
negative implications)
1
Occupational 
health and 
safety (OHS)
Risk
Ensuring a safe and 
healthy 
workplace 
is 
crucial 
for 
employee 
welfare 
and productivity. Poor 
OHS measures can 
lead 
to 
accidents, 
illnesses, 
and 
a 
subsequent increase 
in labour costs due 
to lower productivity 
and 
higher 
medical 
expenses. 
Additionally, 
it 
can result in legal 
liabilities 
and 
regulatory fines.
Proactive 
measures 
are 
in 
place to implement an effective 
occupational 
health 
& 
safety 
programs at PPL.
Both the Company’s plants (in 
Paradeep and Goa) are ISO 45001 
certified, 
ensuring 
adherence 
to 
international 
standards 
for 
occupational health and safety. 
Robust safety procedures are in 
place, including detailed SOPs, 
regular health and safety training, 
and 
continuous 
monitoring. 
Initiatives like HIRA preparation, 
Hazop studies, process safety 
audit, including external safety 
audits & CICG inspection by Govt. 
of Odisha further strengthen safety 
measures.
Negative: 
Workplace 
incidents can harm the 
Company's 
reputation, 
leading 
to 
negative 
publicity 
and 
public 
perception issues. This 
can result in customer 
distrust, loss of business 
opportunities, 
and 
difficulties in attracting 
and 
retaining 
talent. 
Moreover, 
regulatory 
fines can add to financial 
burdens.
2
Chemical 
Safety
Risk
The 
production 
and 
handling 
of 
hazardous chemicals 
like phosphates and 
ammonia are integral 
to 
the 
Company’s 
operations, 
but 
are 
inherently 
risky. 
Improper 
management 
of 
these substances can 
result in spills, leaks, 
and other accidents, 
posing 
severe 
risks 
to 
employee 
safety 
and 
the 
environment. 
Such 
incidents can attract 
regulatory 
scrutiny, 
e n v i r o n m e n t a l 
penalties, and disrupt 
our 
production 
processes.
Comprehensive SOPs and safety 
manuals 
detail 
safe 
handling 
procedures for chemicals. Regular 
training sessions, periodic safety 
audits, 
and 
the 
provision 
of 
adequate PPEs ensure a high 
level 
of 
preparedness 
among 
employees. These measures help 
them in identifying and mitigating 
hazardous 
conditions, 
ensuring 
compliance with safety standards.
Negative: 
Chemical 
safety 
incidents 
can 
severely 
damage 
the 
Company's 
reputation 
among the Company’s 
s t a k e h o l d e r s . 
Major 
accidents 
or 
environmental violations 
can disrupt operations, 
leading 
to 
production 
delays 
or 
shutdowns, 
thereby 
affecting 
financial 
performance. 
Cleanup 
costs 
and 
potential legal liabilities 
add 
further 
financial 
strain.

Business 
Ethics
Opportunity Good 
governance 
and ethical conduct 
are fundamental to 
building stakeholder 
trust and sustaining 
long-term 
growth. 
Ethical practices help 
prevent legal issues, 
enhance 
corporate 
reputation, 
and 
ensure 
sustainable 
business operations.
The Company’s Code of Business 
Conduct and Ethics underscores 
its firm stance against unethical 
practices, including bribery, gifts, 
insider trading, and harassment. 
The code also outlines clear 
escalation 
mechanisms 
for 
individuals 
to 
raise 
concerns 
or 
complaints, 
ensuring 
accountability and transparency.
To further cement its commitment 
to sustainability and responsible 
corporate 
governance, 
the 
Company 
has 
established 
an 
ESG Steering Committee. This 
committee plays a pivotal role 
in 
steering 
initiatives 
related 
to 
environmental 
stewardship, 
corporate social responsibility, and 
governance
Positive: Good corporate 
governance 
systems 
ensure the Company is 
managed in the interests 
of all shareholders. This 
can lead to increased 
investor 
confidence 
and better access to 
capital. Ethical conduct 
enhances 
customer 
loyalty 
and 
employee 
morale, contributing to 
overall business growth 
and financial stability.
4.
Environmental 
management
Risk
The 
industry 
we 
operate in is highly 
scrutinised 
for 
its 
environmental 
impact. Commitment 
to 
environmental 
p r o t e c t i o n 
and 
resource 
c o n s e r v a t i o n 
is 
essential 
for 
s u s t a i n a b l e 
o p e r a t i o n s 
and 
regulatory 
compliance. 
Non-
compliance can lead 
to 
legal 
penalties, 
cleanup costs, and 
reputational damage.
The 
Company’s 
manufacturing 
plants are ISO 14001 certified, 
indicating 
adherence 
to 
international 
environmental 
management standards.
Regular third-party energy audits 
and continuous monitoring help 
identify areas for improvement. 
Compliance 
with 
state 
and 
central pollution control board 
requirements is ensured at all 
times.
Negative: 
Non-
compliance 
with 
environmental 
norms 
can result in significant 
financial repercussions, 
including 
fines, 
legal 
fees, 
and 
increased 
operational costs due 
to mandated corrective 
actions. 
Reputational 
damage can lead to loss 
of customer trust and 
business opportunities, 
further 
impacting 
financial performance.

5.
Inclusion and 
Diversity
Opportunity A 
diverse 
and 
inclusive 
workforce 
fosters 
creativity 
and 
innovation, 
essential for solving 
complex 
problems 
and 
maintaining 
a 
competitive edge. In 
the agricultural sector, 
where diverse needs 
and challenges are 
prevalent, 
inclusivity 
can 
drive 
better 
product development 
and 
customer 
satisfaction.
For strong governance,
the Company has a Board Diversity 
policy in place.
The Company’s inclusive approach 
to talent attraction focuses on the 
right talent for the right role during 
recruitment, irrespective of the 
candidate’s gender, religion, region.
Positive: 
A 
positive 
and 
inclusive 
work 
environment 
drives 
productivity and overall 
better 
performance, 
translating to improved 
financial 
outcomes. 
Additionally, 
a 
strong 
reputation for diversity 
and inclusion can attract 
top talent and enhance 
the Company’s market 
position.
6.
Responsible 
Supply Chain
Risk
An 
efficient 
and 
resilient 
supply 
chain is critical for 
the 
uninterrupted 
production 
and 
meeting 
customer 
d e m a n d s . 
Disruptions can lead 
to production delays, 
increased 
costs, 
and potential loss of 
market share.
We ensure supply chain resilience 
through various initiatives such 
as shifting to Molten Sulphur 
supply from IOCL to reduce carbon 
footprints 
and 
establishing 
a 
vendor evaluation system with ESG 
criteria.
Maintaining 
critical 
vendor 
partnerships 
and 
creating 
alternative 
domestic 
sources 
further 
secure 
our 
supply 
continuity.
Negative: A diversified 
supply 
chain 
builds 
resilience to disruptions 
such as natural disasters, 
geopolitical 
issues, 
or 
supplier 
problems. 
Having 
alternative 
suppliers or contingency 
plans 
ensures 
operational 
continuity, 
mitigating financial risks 
associated with supply 
chain disruptions.
7.
Community 
Relations
Opportunity Building 
and 
maintaining 
positive 
relationships 
with 
local 
communities 
is 
essential 
for 
fostering 
mutual 
trust 
and 
support. 
Being a responsible 
corporate 
citizen 
it helps to ensure 
that our operations 
are 
welcomed 
and 
supported, 
which is crucial for 
sustainable 
growth 
and development.
The Company’s CSR policy guides 
our efforts in community relations 
and development, focusing on 
livelihoods, 
education, 
health 
(WaSH), and the environment. By 
engaging in meaningful community 
initiatives, we aim to build trust 
and contribute to the well-being of 
the communities we serve.
Positive: 
Strong 
community 
relations 
enhance our reputation 
and 
brand 
image, 
improving our standing 
among 
consumers, 
investors, 
and 
other 
stakeholders. 
This 
can lead to increased 
customer 
loyalty 
and 
better investor relations.

Statement by Director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets 
and achievements.
‘PPL continues to play a key role in India's fertilizer industry, and we take our responsibility seriously. Our focus remains 
on innovative and affordable solutions for farmers as we aim to contribute significantly to India's agricultural growth, 
food security, and rural prosperity. This mission guides our continuous improvement in environmental, social, and 
economic performance.
We've made real progress in embedding sustainability across our organisation. Our multiple ISO certifications including 
ISO 9001, 14001, 50001, 45001, and product steward excellence certificate demonstrate our commitment to quality, 
environmental management, energy efficiency, safety, and information security. Over the past year, we've updated our 
policies, introduced new ESG initiatives, and improved our data management. Our annual sustainability and BRSR 
reports reflect these efforts transparently.
Building on our existing sustainability framework, we're now enhancing our supply chain resilience. We're implementing 
a comprehensive program to evaluate and build capacity among our key suppliers, aiming to create a more responsible 
and sustainable supply network. Beyond compliance, we're actively reducing our carbon footprint, improving employee 
wellbeing, and supporting local communities. Innovation and thoughtful decision-making are crucial as we work to 
create lasting positive impact.
As we move forward, we'll continue to focus on transparency, continuous improvement, and creating value for all our 
stakeholders. We believe this approach will contribute to a more sustainable and food-secure India’.

A project was initiated wherein phosphogypsum waste from 
fertilizer industries was combined with dried biomass and 
pyrolyzed to produce a value-added biofertilizer enriched with 
potassium and carbon. This process not only neutralised the waste 
but also generated additional valuable products like pyroligneous 
liquid and syngases, enhancing the sustainability of the fertilizer 
industry

We are focussed on focused on waste heat recovery systems to 
meet our primary energy needs instead of completely relying on 
fossil fuels. This has significantly prevented potential direct GHG 
emissions and reduced our operating costs.

Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria, aiming to minimise risks and enhance transparency in the 
supply chain. The process involves screening suppliers, requiring adherence to PPL’s supplier code of conduct, 
and conducting risk assessments using ESG questionnaires. The framework, which undergoes regular senior 
management review, allows for informed decision-making on supplier engagement and promotes sustainable 
practices throughout our supply chain. Additionally, we will conduct awareness sessions to guide the suppliers in 
improving their ESG performance, ultimately fostering a stronger commitment to sustainability principles.

a)	
Plastics (Including packaging) –
	
PPL handles all plastic waste in accordance with the Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016, and any subsequent 
amendments. Pre-consumer plastic waste generated within the factory premises, such as packaging for raw 
materials and waste bags produced during the packing of fertilizers, is collected and stored in designated yards or 
bins allocated specifically for plastic waste. The Company then collaborates with an authorised recycler approved 
by the Goa State Pollution Control Board for proper disposal of the collected plastic waste. Additionally, PPL has 
implemented Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) compliance for packaging products, as per the Plastic Waste 
Management Rules, 2016.
b)	
E-Waste –
	
PPL manages all e-waste in compliance with the E-Waste Management Rules, 2016. A dedicated shed is maintained 
for the storage of e-waste to ensure proper handling. All e-waste generated is sold exclusively to dismantlers or 
recyclers authorised by the Goa State Pollution Control Board. Records are meticulously maintained in accordance 
with the E-Waste Management Rules, 2016, and annual returns in Form 3 are submitted to the Goa State Pollution 
Control Board each year.
c)	
Acid Batteries –
	
The Company has a buyback policy with vendors for used lead-acid batteries.

Hazardous waste –
	
Hazardous waste generated from various plant areas is collected in closed MS drums or barrels and stored in 
designated areas within the hazardous waste shed. Labels, as per Form 8 of the Hazardous Waste Management 
Rule 2016, are affixed to the drums or containers for disposal. Chemical sludge from the effluent treatment plant 
is dried in sludge drying beds and then fully recycled into the NPK-A and NPK-B plants. The management of 
hazardous waste adheres to a Standard Operating Procedure.
e)	
Other waste such as metal scrap, waste activated carbon, rubber scrap etc.-
	
Solid waste is segregated into separate bins. Bio-degradable waste is collected in green bins, non-bio-degradable 
waste in blue bins, and oil-containing waste in gray bins.
	
Bio-degradable waste from canteens, offices, and households in the township is sent to a vermicomposting 
unit at PPL premises, producing organic manure (bio-fertilizer).
	
Non-bio-degradable waste generated at PPL is sent to Goa Waste Management Corporation Limited for 
co-processing, recycling, or disposal.
	
Construction debris is used for backfilling material in structures, building foundations, and road making.
	
Sand from filters is similarly used for backfilling and road construction projects.
4.

waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to Pollution Control 
Boards? If not, provide steps taken and address the same.
	
Yes, EPR is applicable to PPL’s activities under the Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016.
	
We strictly adhere to all relevant environmental regulations and guidelines for handling and disposing of plastics 
and packaging. Paradeep Phosphates Limited is registered with the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) as a 
Brand Owner EPR for the disposal of plastic waste generated by PPL’s products.
	
We are committed to reducing end-user plastic waste and setting an example for other companies. PPL 
collaborates closely with GEM Enviro Management Private Limited, a Waste Management Agency specialising in 
the collection and aggregation of various packaging waste types across India, using technology to streamline the 
process.
	
This collaboration with GEM helps PPL fulfil its EPR compliance requirements as stipulated under the Plastic 
Waste Management Rules, 2016, and its amendments in 2018. It also demonstrates our leadership in managing 
post-consumer plastic waste.

and embedding a safety-oriented culture. Both 
of our manufacturing units, Paradeep in Odisha 
and Zuarinagar in Goa, are certified under ISO 
45001:2018, 
an

b.	
What are the processes used to identify work-
related hazards and assess risks on a routine 
and non-routine basis by the entity?
	
We employ a comprehensive approach to 
identify work-related hazards and assess risks 
on both a routine and non-routine basis. This 
strategy involves active participation from senior 
executives, zonal safety members, and contract 
workers. We utilise Hazard Identification and 
Risk Assessment (HIRA) as a foundational step 
in our safety management process.
	
Routine 
safety 
measures 
include 
conducting 
thorough 
Why-Why 
analysis and process safety audits, 
often involving external agencies for 
unbiased observations. The Company 
also undergoes inspections by the 
Government of Odisha’s CICG (Chief 
Inspectorate of Factories) to ensure 
adherence to safety standards.
	
Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) studies 
and Quantitative Risk Assessments (QRA) 
provide deeper insights into potential risks, 
guiding the creation of Standard Operating 
Procedures (SOPs), Operational Control 
Procedures (OCP), and Safety Management 
Plans (SMP).
	
For non-routine activities involving higher 
risk levels, we conduct job safety analysis 
(JSA) to thoroughly assess and mitigate 
potential hazards. We have a Safety Mobile 
App for instant recording and sharing of 
unsafe observations.
	
Safety touch initiatives and safety hot 
spots are implemented to identify unsafe 
conditions and vulnerable areas on the 
shop floor.
	
Dedicated 
safety 
officers 
carry 
out 
daily inspections to ensure continuous 
monitoring of safety protocols.
	
The Company sets Accident Prevention 
Plans with safety targets, actively overseen 
by Heads of Departments (HOD) and Heads 
of Sections (HOS).
	
Regular 
surveys 
are 
conducted 
to 
understand employees’ safety concerns.
	
A cross-functional team performs monthly 
inspections of the plant and contractors’ 
sheds to inspect tools and equipment.
	
Additionally, a Task Force Committee 
focuses on workplace safety, guiding 
personnel 
to 
adhere 
to 
SOPs 
and 
enforce safe practices during shutdown 
procedures.
	
Employee 
participation 
in 
safety 
improvements 
is 
encouraged 
through 
strategically placed suggestion boxes.
	
Quantitative 
risk 
assessment 
was 
conducted by M/s. Det Norske Veritas 
(DNV)-Hyderabad.
c.	
Whether you have processes for workers to 
report the work-related hazards and to remove 
themselves from such risks. (Yes/No)
	
Yes. The Company has established a centralised 
committee system for workers to raise concerns 
about work-related hazards. This includes 
the Central Safety Committee (Apex Safety 
Committee) and Zonal Safety Committees 
(Sub-Safety Committees), which are crucial for 
fostering a culture of safety and accountability. 
Regular monthly safety meetings conducted by 
contractors provide a platform for addressing 
workers' concerns directly. Safety suggestion 
boxes placed at the gates and canteen offer an 
anonymous feedback mechanism, ensuring that 
every voice can be heard without fear of reprisal.
	
Additionally, 
mass 
safety 
responsiveness 
sessions (Safety Mann Ki Baat) are organised 
every third Thursday of the month, reinforcing 
the importance of safety in daily operations. 
Concerns can also be raised during safety 
theme meetings and morning safety pep talks, 
providing multiple avenues for workers to 
engage in the safety dialogue. These measures 
are not just procedural but are integral to 
creating a proactive safety culture at PPL.
d.	
Do the employees/worker of the entity have 
access 
to 
non-occupational 
medical 
and 
healthcare services? (Yes/No)
	
Yes

for employees to voice their grievances: meeting with departmental heads or supervisors, sending an email, or mailing 
a letter. All complaints are reviewed by a committee, which evaluates and investigates the issues before recommending 
appropriate corrective actions to the relevant Business Units. The Member Secretary compiles a quarterly report on 
human rights violation complaints and the actions taken, and submits this report to the Chief Human Resources Officer 
and Managing Director every six months.

Yes, we have implemented Zero Liquid Discharge mechanisms, achieved by a closed-loop water cycle and various 
recycling routes. Both of our manufacturing plants are equipped with Effluent Treatment Plants (ETP) and Sewage 
Treatment Plants (STP) to treat wastewater efficiently. This treated wastewater is then reused, significantly reducing 
our reliance on freshwater sources. Moreover, we have installed a reverse osmosis (RO) plant to treat Cooling Tower 
Blowdown streams, further minimising freshwater consumption. The permeate from the RO plant is reused as cooling 
tower make-up water, while the discarded is repurposed as process water within our manufacturing facilities.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Greenhouse Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details.
	
We are dedicated to continuously enhancing energy efficiency and minimising the carbon footprint of our operations. 
To this end, we have initiated several projects. One notable initiative is the implementation of Heat Recovery Systems 
(HRS) across all three of our sulphuric acid plants, which harnesses steam produced in the Sulphuric Acid Plant for 
captive power generation, thus improving energy efficiency and reducing our environmental impact.
	
Additionally, in January 2024, at our plant in Goa, we upgraded our ammonia converter from a two-bed to a three-bed 
configuration and installed a new high-pressure synloop boiler downstream. This enhancement increased ammonia 
conversion per pass by 3-3.5%, allowing the excess heat to be utilised for producing high-pressure steam, thereby 
reducing the specific energy consumption of ammonia by 0.3 Gcal/MT. This project saves 258 Gcal of energy per day 
at an ammonia load of 860 MTPD, resulting in a daily reduction of CO2 emissions by 24.77 tCO2e.

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by 
your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices 
adopted to manage such wastes.
	
Our waste management strategy is anchored on the 3R principle of 'Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle.' This approach ensures 
that we manage waste in a compliant and ecologically responsible manner. We prioritise maximising the reuse of waste 
across our operations, and any waste that cannot be reused is disposed of according to regulatory requirements and

statutory guidelines. We are also committed to reducing the generation of hazardous and non-hazardous waste at our 
manufacturing facilities. For example:
-	
Sulphur muck – Sulphur muck generated from production of sulphuric acid is repurposed as a filler in fertilizer 
manufacturing. Additionally, we use molten sulphur from IOCL to minimise the generation of sulphur muck.
-	
ETP Sludge – ETP sludge is also utilised as a filler in fertilizer production. We are also continuously working to 
reduce effluent to the ETP and minimize the generation of ETP sludge.
	
We have taken significant steps to comply with the Charter on Corporate Responsibility for Environmental Protection 
(CREP) for Fertilizer Industries. One key initiative was phasing out the use of Arsenic in the CO2 absorption system at 
our Ammonia plant. We replaced the Arsenic-based solution with a safer, non-arsenic dual activator-based GV solution 
and scientifically disposed of the existing arsenic inventory.
