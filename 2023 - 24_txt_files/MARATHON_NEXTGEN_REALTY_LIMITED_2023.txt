26. Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues pertaining to environmental and social matters that present a risk or an 
opportunity to your business, rationale for identifying the same, approach to adapt or mitigate the risk along-with its financial implications.1 
 
                                                
1 Material issues identified are referred from the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) 2023-2024 version. SASB Standards are maintained and enhanced 
by the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB). This follows the SASB’s merger with the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) into the Value 
Reporting Foundation (VRF) and subsequent consolidation into the IFRS Foundation in 2022.

1 
Energy 
Management 
Risk 
The Company consumes significant amount of energy 
for space heating, ventilating, air conditioning, water 
heating, lighting and using equipment and appliances. 
The Company understands type and magnitude of 
energy used and strategies for energy management are 
dependent upon the real estate asset class, among other 
factors. High intensity use of energy causes a risk of 
high energy cost & increased GHG emissions. Further, 
fluctuating energy costs & stringent energy related 
regulations/ legislations add to the operational risks. 
 
The Company endeavours to assess the ecological 
consequences 
resulting 
from 
its 
energy 
consumption 
and 
subsequently 
implements 
essential measures to reduce the identified risks. 
Since enhancing energy efficiency depends on 
specific factors like property characteristics and 
location, 
adherence 
to 
local 
construction 
regulations, viable options for adoption of 
renewable energy usage etc.  
 
Negative 
 
* There was no 
negative financial 
impact in the 
reporting year 
2023-24. 
2 
Water 
Management 
Risk 
The Company’s buildings utilize substantial volumes of 
water during their operations, primarily for water 
fixtures, building machinery, appliances. The expenses 
associated with water consumption are contingent upon 
the type of property, the geographical location and other 
determining factors and considering the water shortage 
– it is on an increasing trend. Effluent discharge out of 
construction adds to the adverse impact on environment 
and can lead to regulatory costs if not managed well. 
The Company has a well-built system of water 
management which helps the Company to achieve 
Sustainable usage and consumption of water. The 
initiatives include: 
 Water Efficient Chrome Plated Fittings that are 
used during its construction activities 
 Effective & 
efficient 
sewage 
treatment 
measures adopted 
 As a part of sustainable sourcing the Company 
tries to reduce dependency on external water

sources through concentrated efforts on ground 
water replenishment by rain water harvesting 
and planned bore well digging. 
 
3 
Impacts of 
Climate 
Change 
Risk
The impact of climate change on the Company’s 
operations is evident through recurring or severe 
extreme weather occurrences and shifts in climate 
patterns. Impact of climate change can affect the 
increasing usage of heat and water resistant construction 
material which may incur environmental, labour and 
monetary cost. 
The Company recognizes the significant impact of 
the Climate Change being in a business that uses 
materials that could lead to negative climatic 
changes. However, the Company is taking few 
steps to try and curb such impacts: 
 Usage of Sustainable HVAC (Heating, 
Ventilation and Air Conditioning) system 
providing fresh air & reducing CO2. 
 Using solar panels, thereby saving around 20-
22% in the projects with almost 50% reduction 
in potable water consumption. 
 
Negative 
 
* There was no 
negative financial 
impact in the 
reporting year 
2023-24. 
4 
Adherence to 
Labour 
Legislations 
Risk 
The Company operates in a labour intensive industry. 
Considering the Company’s operations, it faces various 
complexities and legal challenges with respect to 
adherence of Labour Legislations. Labour law-related 
risks in this industry are significant due to high 
dependency on a diverse and often transient workforce, 
as well as the potential for accidents and workplace 
hazards. 
 
The Company follows all the necessary legal 
compliances with respect to the Labour laws. It 
ensures to maintain a safe & healthy workplace, 
takes strict actions against human right violence, 
maintains proper record keeping along and 
redresses grievances of their stakeholders. This is 
evident from the fact that there has not been any 
material labour law non-compliance issue during 
the year. 
 
Negative 
 
* There was no 
negative financial 
impact in the 
reporting year 
2023-24.

Changing 
Economic 
Scenarios 
 
Opportunity India’s economy is predominantly focused on domestic 
factors, making it relatively less vulnerable to the effects 
of a global economic slowdown. This is clearly evident 
in the current context, where India is driving global 
economic growth. Furthermore, the Indian real estate 
sector is supported by robust underlying drivers. These 
include rising incomes, favourable demographic trends,

urbanization, and the preference for nuclear families. 
The Company looks at it as an opportunity to expand its 
business operations and upscale. 
 
6 
Land 
Acquisition 
Risk 
Land stands as the paramount foundational resource for 
the Company’s operations. Due to the finite nature of 
this asset & lack of availability of land with reasonable 
valuation in lesser-represented micro-markets, it might 
influence the Company’s expansion prospects. 
To mitigate the risks in land acquisitions, the 
Company enters into the Memorandum of 
Understanding and make advances for the land or 
land development rights prior to entering into any 
definitive agreement with the party. The Company 
ensures that negotiations might result in either a 
transaction for the Land Acquisition or Land 
Development Rights or revenue sharing.

came into effect on May 1, 2017. Complete project information, as required by the RERA, are 
posted on the MahaRera website along with quarterly updates on the project's status. Additionally, 
achieving client satisfaction is our main goal, and it motivates us to keep improving the products 
we offer. We have a systematic approach in place to collect input from clients that stop by our sales 
offices. To improve the entire client experience, we assess residential developments prior to home 
transfer. Likewise, with our business clients, we frequently carry out surveys to check if their 
requirements are being met and their anticipations are satisfied.
