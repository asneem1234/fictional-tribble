Employees are an important 
resource at GSPL. Because of the 
nature of the operations, staﬀ 
health and safety are critical. 
Health, safety and wellbeing is 
ensured by means of evaluation 
and oversight of health and safety 
risks throughout the operations.
In contrast to the burning of coal 
and oil, natural gas combustion 
e m i t s  s i g n i ë c a n t l y  f e we r 
pollutants and GHGs per unit of 
energy. Technologies and 
regulations are in place to reduce 
carbon emissions caused by 
natural gas leaks, allowing for the 
complete realization of natural gas 
potential climate beneëts. As a 
result, GSPL has a great chance as 
it increases operations to provide 
natural gas, a fuel that is friendly to 
the environment.
Human rights have been cited as 
one of the priorities by our 
employees, communities, and 
investors. 
Our commitment to advancing a 
fair and equitable culture and 
respect for human rights 
throughout the business is a 
crucial part of realising our 
strategy and overarching purpose. 
Any violation of the human rights 
code will result in disciplinary 
action. Furthermore, it could 
impact our image and our capacity 
to draw talent.
In case of risk, 
approach to adapt or 
mitigate 
GSPL has a comprehensive

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If  Yes, then provide details.
Reduction of Natural Gas emission in Operational & Maintenance Activities:
Terminals of GSPL are provided with Gas monitoring device. At any unforeseen event of gas leakage, immediate mitigative action 
can be taken to isolate the leakage source.
GSPL strives to lower the emissions of natural gas from its operations, either as part of a planned release or because of an unexpected 
release. 
Dial Before Dig Campaign
GSPL educates and inìuences stakeholders such as local municipal authorities, other utilities, their contractors, and their ëeld staﬀ 
(including heavy machinery like JCB, HDD operators, and so on) who undertake digging and horizontal directional drilling 
(HDD) activities as part of their laying or construction activity through this campaign. e campaign aims to raise awareness of the 
safety and environmental risks of natural gas release into the atmosphere as a result of damage to GSPL's natural gas pipeline 
network during digging and HDD operations. ird parties are urged to contact GSPL to conërm the location before beginning 
any digging / excavation / HDD activities to avoid causing damage to the natural gas pipeline network.

GSPL is acquiring Right of Use (RoU) on land on temporary basis only and thus not changing any land use pattern. Pipeline 
laying activities in particular land area will be limited to only few days and the soil will be reinstated near to its original condition 
after laying of pipeline hence the eﬀected landowners can resume their cultivation activities as before. So, the project impact is 
temporary in nature and reversible. In addition to that, pipeline alignment is planned away from any village or settlement thus 
Rehabilitation and Resettlement issues does not arise.
