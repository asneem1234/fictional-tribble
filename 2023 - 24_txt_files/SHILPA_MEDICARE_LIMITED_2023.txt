Water & 
Waste 
Management
Risk
Since water is  critical for the 
manufacturing of pharmaceutical 
products, preparation of reagents 
and cleaning (e.g. washing and 
rinsing) , inadequate water supply 
is identified as a significant risk. 
Additionally, irresponsible waste 
management may affect water 
and soil quality, which in turn 
affects the ecosystem and health 
of the society at large.
As 
part 
of 
an 
established 
risk 
management 
framework, 
we 
periodically assess water and waste 
related risks.  The key focus areas 
of our water management strategy 
include optimising water usage and 
identifying alternate water sources. 
We 
have 
implemented 
waste 
management systems at all our 
facilities.

Research & 
Development
Opportunity
R&D is essential for  green 
product innovation and ESG 
performance 
enhancement 
of an enterprise. Therefore, 
strategic 
investments 
and 
public 
disclosure 
of 
 
R&D 
initiatives allow  stakeholders 
to 
gain 
insight 
into 
the 
organisation’s  approach and 
scope of operations.
We have undertaken several initiatives 
for 
‘Green 
Chemistry’ 
including 
transition from solvent-based to water 
based 
reactions, 
using 
harmless, 
greener solvents instead of hazardous 
ones, enhancing our solvent recovery 
capabilities and ultimately, improving 
our processes to maximise resource 
efficiency. We have initiated Life 
Cycle Assessments (LCA)  for certain 
products to identify and further reduce 
our environmental footprint.

undertaken by the Company. The 
aim is to build resilient solutions that 
enable underserved communities to

Business 
Ethics / Anti-
Bribery & Anti-
Corruption 
/ Ethical 
Governance
Risk
Our commitment to efficient 
corporate governance  helps 
us create long-term value for all 
our stakeholders. Our Business 
and Supplier Code of Conduct 
incorporates 
the 
principles 
of ethics and integrity (anti-
bribery, anti-corruption, anti-
money 
laundering, 
whistle 
blowing and so forth) and 
roles and responsibilities of 
concerned 
personnel 
are 
defined in accordance to it.
While the Business Code of Conduct 
applies to all Directors and employees 
of our Company,  subsidiaries and 
affiliates, our suppliers and service 
providers have to follow the Supplier 
Code of Conduct which encompasses 
the ethics and principles of integrity, 
transparency 
and 
accountability. 
These principles form a moat around 
our business, guiding our conduct 
and decision-making as well as 
promoting stakeholder trust. We 
conduct our business adhering to 
our anti-corruption policies and all 
applicable laws.

Occupational 
Health & 
Safety, Safe & 
Empowering 
Workplace
Risk
Accidents at workplace may 
confer 
risk 
to 
operational 
efficiency. Additionally, since 
employees form the backbone 
of all our operations, it is 
incumbent upon us to prioritise 
their health, safety and well-
being through a nurturing and 
secure work environment.
Our Safety, Health and Environment 
(EHS) policy governs our business 
facilities and employees through 
research and operation.
Our employees, both permanent 
workers and contractors are trained 
on occupational health and safety, 
specific 
work-related 
risks 
and 
hazards. 
We 
have 
implemented 
“‘Occupational 
Health 
& 
Safety 
Management System’ ” and “ ‘Process 
Safety Management System’  at all our 
plants. Periodic safety assessments 
against 
international 
standards 
are 
conducted 
to 
evaluate 
the 
effectiveness of current systems  to 
further improve our safety measures. .

Statutory & 
Regulatory 
Compliances
Risk
Our Company strictly abides 
by guidelines and requirements 
set 
by 
governing 
bodies, 
including manufacturing quality 
standards. Periodic inspections 
are conducted across all our 
manufacturing 
sites, 
and 
if 
the 
regulatory 
and 
quality 
standards and systems are not 
found adequate, it could result 
in observations.   This might 
impact our ability to meet 
patient demand and generate 
value for our stakeholders
 
We are  dedicated to delivering 
quality. We continue to invest time, 
money and effort into our production 
and robust quality-testing systems at 
our developmental and manufacturing 
facilities to ensure that every product 
adheres to quality standards and 
cGMP regulations. Through  ‘Quality 
by Design’, we ensure quality and use 
exceptional tools to minimise  risks.
We leverage information technology 
to digitise and enhance our  quality 
control processes.

Diversity, 
Equity & 
Inclusion
Opportunity
We 
cultivate 
a 
workplace 
that 
values 
diversity 
and 
inclusion, across all levels of 
the organisation (Board, senior, 
junior and mid-levels). Such a 
work environment  supports 
the introduction of alternative 
perspectives, 
diverse 
experiences, novel concepts 
and 
inventive 
approaches, 
facilitating 
sustainable 
value 
creation for our stakeholders in 
the long run.
We are also working to increase the 
representation of women across roles 
and teams, exploring new entry level 
routes such as apprentice hiring and 
actively recruiting women.
Numerous 
steps 
have 
been 
undertaken 
to 
build 
a 
gender-
inclusive workplace. 
The Company has an ‘Equal Pay for 
Equal Work’ practice in place, where 
employees are compensated based 
on their merit, irrespective of the 
gender they identify with.
We promote non-discrimination and 
no harassment through established 
policies and procedures.

Talent 
Attraction & 
Retentions
 Opportunity
Since the employees form the 
most important asset for the 
Company, it is essential to 
hire  and retain skilled talent 
to enable the organisation to 
meet its target. This is a difficult 
challenge to address since the 
industry is primarily knowledge-
driven,  technology-based and 
heavily reliant on  individuals 
well versed with advanced 
technology.
We use people analytics to track 
employee performance, identify  skill 
gaps and flight risks to enable retention 
of skilled employees. By providing 
long-term upskilling and reskilling 
opportunities 
for 
our 
workforce 
and embracing strategic workforce 
planning for our operations, we  not 
only address structural pay gaps but 
also foster internal mobility, optimise 
productivity and  staff expenses.

Opportunity
Our 
complex 
geopolitical 
and 
regulatory 
environment 
presents potential challenges 
to operations, supply chains, 
market 
access 
and 
overall 
business performance. These 
can 
arise 
from 
geopolitical 
instability, 
changes 
in 
government 
policies, 
trade 
disputes, sanctions and intricate 
compliance 
requirements. 
Through proactive monitoring 
and strategic adaptation, these 
risks can be mitigated . 
We are focused on identification of 
key business, operational, strategic, 
and business continuity risks, which 
are reviewed periodically by the Risk 
Management Committee at the Board 
level. 
We prioritise a sustainable supply 
chain for the timely availability of our 
medicines, and to ensure business 
continuity in the face of disruptions.
We continuously strive to improve 
our resiliency posture focusing on 
the ability to provide and maintain an 
acceptable level of service in the face 
of any interruption and proactively 
plan for being prepared to respond to 
an uncertain situation.

Describe the Process for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity 
	
The Company has implemented a procedure to determine, report and manage material topics related to sustainability and 
ESG applicable for all units of the Company including its supply chain. The Company identifies  key stakeholders across its 
activities to engage with them and establish business relationships. The Company draws a  list of individuals and groups 
whose interests are affected or could be affected by its activities. Potential stakeholders for the Company are relevant 
government agencies, employees/other workers, local communities, suppliers, business partners, consumers, customers, 
shareholders/other investors, etc. When identifying its stakeholders, the Company ensures that identified stakeholders 
do not have a direct relationship with it (workers in the supply chain or local communities that live at a distance from its 
facilities),  those who are unable to articulate their views ( future generations). By following this process, the Company 
identifies  key stakeholders whose views should be considered while determining the material topics, which are reviewed 
and updated once a year

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission. If Yes, then provide details.
	
Yes. In line with our goal of becoming ‘Carbon Neutral by 2030’, we are working towards improving our energy conservation,

10.	  Briefy describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by 
your Company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices 
adopted to manage such wastes.
	
At SML we strive to minimise the volume of waste generated. The Company implements low-waste technologies and work 
practices, optimises manufacturing processes and uses high-quality raw materials to reduce waste. These initiatives have 
resulted in consistent reduction in volume of waste generated. 
	
SML currently generates 12 types of solid and liquid wastes. This waste can be categorised into two main groups: disposable 
hazardous waste (3 types) and recyclable hazardous and other wastes (9 types). To ensure responsible waste management, 
we maintain a segregation process at the point of generation, followed by collection and storage in designated areas that 
are well-ventilated and environmentally safe.
	
During FY23-24, about 60.43% of waste was reused, recycled or recovered. This encompasses  plastic, paper, metal, 
glass, civil debris, e-waste, battery waste, used oil, canteen waste, boiler ash, select process residues and recovered 
solvents. The remaining waste is disposed of through authorised agencies, ensuring environmentally safe and regulatory-
compliant processes.
