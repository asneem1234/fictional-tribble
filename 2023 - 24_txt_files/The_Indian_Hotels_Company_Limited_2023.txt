Climate 
Strategy
Risk
IHCL acknowledges that climate change presents both 
risks and opportunities that are essential to address 
for the sustainability of its operations. The recognition 
of climate-related risks—including regulatory shifts, 
resource scarcity, and physical impact to assets—
compels IHCL to integrate a robust Climate Strategy 
into its business model. This focus on climate 
resilience ensures compliance, operational continuity, 
and asset protection.
IHCL’s climate strategy is underscored by the 
integration of renewable energy (RE), energy 
efficiency interventions and other resource 
conservation actions. The company is shifting 
towards renewable sources like solar and wind 
energy to power its operations, reducing reliance on 
fossil fuels and curbing emissions. Alongside, IHCL 
is upgrading its properties with energy-efficient 
technologies, encompassing state-of-the-art HVAC 
systems, lighting, and smart building solutions to 
minimise energy consumption. The IHCL Business 
Continuity and Disaster Response Plan has been 
developed to safeguard the smooth operation of 
critical business functions and ensure the well-being 
of guests and employees during disruptive incidents 
or disasters. These actions not only mitigate climate-
related risks by enhancing operational resilience 
and resource optimisation but also position IHCL 
as a leader in sustainable hospitality, committed to 
reducing its environmental footprint and catering 
to the sustainability expectations of guests and 
investors.

(Indicate positive

Opportunity
Simultaneously, the company seizes opportunities 
for competitive advantage through the adoption of 
energy-efficient practices that promise cost savings, 
enhance brand reputation, foster innovation, and 
align with the growing market demand for eco-friendly 
tourism experiences. Moreover, IHCL’s Climate Strategy 
bolsters its commitment to stakeholder engagement 
by meeting the environmental expectations of 
guests, attracting talent, and uplifting communities. 
By proactively pivoting towards a climate-conscious 
framework, IHCL not only mitigates risks associated 
with a changing climate but also captures the 
potential for market differentiation, ensuring long-
term business prosperity and shareholder value in a 
world increasingly focused on sustainability.
Positive implications
Emission 
and Energy 
Management
Opportunity
Emission and energy management represent a 
material opportunity for IHCL in terms of cost 
reduction, 
regulatory 
compliance, 
and 
brand 
enhancement. By implementing energy-efficient 
technologies and reducing emissions, IHCL can lower 
operational expenses, comply with increasingly 
stringent environmental regulations, and enhance its 
reputation as a sustainable hospitality provider.
To mitigate energy and emission management 
risks, IHCL has implemented energy-efficient 
technologies, such as solar hot water systems, heat 
pumps, and waste heat recovery units, leading to 
significant energy savings. The company has also 
transitioned to LED lighting, introduced energy-
efficient laundry systems, and installed advanced air 
conditioning units. These initiatives not only reduce 
IHCL’s environmental impact while also mitigating 
the financial and reputational risks associated with 
energy and emissions
Positive implications
Risk
However, if emissions and energy consumption are 
not managed effectively, the consequences can be 
significant, including a rise in operational expenses 
due to inefficiencies and increased energy prices. 
Additionally, non-compliance regulations can result 
in fines from regulatory bodies, while the company’s 
public image may suffer, leading to a potential loss of 
customer trust and market share
Negative 
implications
Waste 
Stewardship
Opportunity
Efficient waste management is essential for IHCL 
due to the large volume of waste generated by the 
global hotel operations. Inadequate waste handling 
can harm the environment and communities, while 
also increasing disposal costs. By implementing 
effective waste reduction and recycling measures, the 
company can save costs, maintain clean properties, 
and demonstrate its commitment to sustainability.
At IHCL, all biodegradable waste undergoes 
composting, with 20 hotels equipped with on-
site composters. Initiatives are in progress to 
eradicate single-use plastic disposables, including 
the complete elimination of plastic straws and 
the planned substitution of PET bottles with glass 
bottles for serving drinking water in guest rooms 
and banquets. Additionally, 19 bottling plants have 
been established across all properties to facilitate 
the transition towards plastic-free services on a 
larger scale.
Positive implications
Food Safety 
and Quality
Opportunity
Implementing robust food safety measures presents 
an opportunity for IHCL to enhance customer 
satisfaction, uphold its reputation for excellence, and 
comply with regulatory standards. By ensuring the 
highest standards of food safety and quality, IHCL can 
attract and retain customers, leading to increased 
revenue and loyalty.
IHCL enforces rigorous food safety protocols, 
conducts routine inspections, and provides ongoing 
training to staff members to ensure strict adherence 
to hygiene standards.
Positive implications
Talent 
Management 
and Retention
Risk
Failure to attract, retain, and develop top talent can 
hinder 
organisational 
performance, 
innovation, 
and competitiveness. In the hospitality industry, 
where service excellence is integral, a skilled and 
motivated workforce is essential for delivering 
exceptional guest experiences. Additionally, talent 
shortages, particularly in specialised roles such as 
chefs, concierge, and hospitality management, can 
exacerbate operational challenges.
To address the risks associated with talent 
management, 
IHCL 
strategically 
provides 
competitive compensation to attract quality talent. 
The company emphasizes career progression, giving 
employees a clear vision of their growth potential 
within the organization. Furthermore, IHCL is 
dedicated to nurturing a positive and engaging work 
environment, which is instrumental in retaining a 
skilled and motivated workforce.

Opportunity
Effective talent management at IHCL unlocks 
opportunities to strengthen its brand and drive 
innovation, with a well-managed workforce 
delivering standout service in the competitive 
hospitality industry. Engaged employees serve as 
brand ambassadors, enhancing IHCL’s reputation 
and customer loyalty. Strategic workforce planning

the expertise of seasoned staff, boosting overall 
operational efficiency
Positive implications
Guest 
Experience
Opportunity
Customer 
experience 
directly 
impacts 
guest 
satisfaction, loyalty, and ultimately, the company’s 
bottom line. IHCL operates in the highly competitive 
hospitality industry, where exceptional service and 
personalised experiences are important. By prioritising 
customer experience, IHCL can differentiate itself 
from competitors, build strong brand loyalty, and 
attract repeat business.
IHCL’s 
commitment 
to 
exceptional 
guest 
experiences is evident through its integration of 
innovative technologies and personalised service. 
Embracing local culture, each hotel crafts custom 
experiences to enchant guests with Taj’s renowned 
intuitive service. The IHCL Response Assistant (IRA), 
an AI-powered chatbot, optimises operations, while 
I-DOCS, an omnichannel platform, enriches guest 
interactions. Furthermore, IHCL’s I-ZEST platform 
enhances operational efficiency and safety, allowing 
guests to seamlessly manage check-ins, access 
amenities, and settle bills via their devices.
Positive implications
Supply Chain 
Management
Opportunity
Supply chain management presents a significant 
opportunity for IHCL to enhance operational efficiency, 
reduce costs, and improve guest satisfaction. By 
optimising its supply chain, IHCL can streamline 
procurement processes, ensuring the timely delivery 
of high-quality goods and services to its properties. 
Moreover, a well-managed supply chain enables IHCL 
to maintain consistent standards across its properties, 
ensuring a seamless guest experience.
IHCL is dedicated to modernising, streamlining, and 
implementing a process-oriented approach to the 
supply chain function, which serves as the backbone 
for its diverse portfolio of hotels. IHCL collaborates 
with numerous supplier partners across the country 
and have established efficient standard operating 
procedures to systematically meet quality, cost, and 
delivery objectives.
The company’s supply chain management prioritises 
the efficient deployment and optimal utilisation of 
resources while integrating dispersed supplier base 
into the organisational culture and ethos.

Statement by director responsible for the BRSR report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets and achievement:
Mr. Puneet Chhatwal (Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer): Being the oldest operating company of the Tata Group, we have 
always embraced the vision of our founder Jamshedji Tata, who believed that the community is not just another stakeholder, but the 
very reason for our existence. Throughout the years, we have adopted a responsible approach to Environmental, Social, and Governance 
(ESG) practices in all aspects of our operations. We have introduced an industry leading ESG+ programme called Paathya, which sets clear 
milestones for various ESG initiatives to be achieved by 2030. Additionally, we have committed ourselves to the Science-Based Targets 
initiative and are actively working towards achieving Net Zero Emissions to prioritise environmental sustainability. All IHCL hotels are 
Earth Check certified, with 21 hotels attaining Platinum status, an esteemed global benchmark. We are dedicated to decarbonising our 
operations, which includes eliminating single-use plastics and implementing other measures. For Scope 2 emissions, we have established 
significant agreements for green power for numerous properties. Furthermore, we have a comprehensive programme in place to 
collaborate with our supply chain partners on Scope 3 emissions. We are in the process of exploring various measures related to Scope 3 
emissions for our customers. We are also actively working with our owner partners to implement ESG initiatives within their respective 
hotels. Our employees are the backbone of our business, and we deeply appreciate their commitment and care towards our community, 
customers, and each other. Empowering and enabling our employees to carry out our strategic priorities while embracing sustainability as 
a fundamental principle is crucial to our future success.

Of the instances disclosed in Question 2 above, details of the Appeal/ Revision preferred in cases where 
monetary or non-monetary action has been appealed.
	
I.	
An appeal was filed on March 28, 2024 on the ground that there is no excess availment of CENVAT credit with 
regard to Taj Lands End. Taj Lands End had paid service tax on receipt of advance from customers and on 
issuance of tax invoices against those advance payments, instead of reducing the service tax already paid thereon. 
Taj Lands End had reported the same as CENVAT credit in ST-3 Returns, inadvertently. Thus, there is no short 
payment of service tax.
	
II.	
The company is in process of filing an appeal against the said order by the State GST department in connection 
with a tax demand for which Penalty of H 11,93,153/ - is levied in relation to the GST Audit of hotels in Maharashtra

10. Health and safety management system:
a. 
Whether an occupational health and safety 
management system has been implemented 
by the entity? (Yes/No)
Yes
 
What is the coverage of such system?
The system covers all employees & workers working with IHCL across all the hotels.
b. 
What are the processes used to identify 
work-related hazards and assess risks on a 
routine and non-routine basis by the entity?
Routine Risk Assessment Processes
	
−Regular Safety Audits and Inspections: IHCL conducts periodic safety audits and 
inspections across all properties. These audits are designed to identify existing hazards 
and potential risks in the daily operations of the hotels. The audits cover various aspects 
including fire safety, electrical installations, kitchen operations, and guest areas.
	
−Employee Reporting Mechanisms: Employees are encouraged to report hazards 
immediately using an incident reporting system. This proactive engagement helps in 
early identification of routine risks that may arise during daily operations.
Non-Routine Risk Assessment Processes
	
−Dynamic Safety Risk Assessments: In response to specific incidents or external 
changes, such as construction activities or the introduction of new equipment, IHCL 
conducts dynamic safety risk assessments. These assessments involve revisiting and 
analysing the potential impacts of the new variables on existing safety protocols 
(change management).
	
−Comprehensive Pre-Construction Risk Analysis: Before the commencement of any 
new construction or major renovation projects, a thorough risk analysis is conducted. 
This analysis focuses on identifying potential hazards associated with new construction 
activities, including high-risk tasks and environmental impacts. It helps in planning 
safety measures and emergency responses tailored to the specific risks identified.
	
−Incident Analysis and Investigation: Any accidents or safety incidents are followed 
by a detailed incident analysis to determine the root causes. These investigations 
help in understanding non-routine hazards and in developing corrective measures to 
prevent recurrence.
Ongoing Improvements and Feedback Integration
	
−Feedback Mechanisms: Feedback from employees and safety audits are continuously 
analysed to update risk assessment methodologies. This integration ensures that both 
routine and non-routine processes are refined over time to enhance safety outcomes.
	
−Best Practice Sharing: Learnings from both routine and non-routine assessments 
are shared across the organisation through periodic Safety and Security Policy (S&S) 
updates and inter-hotel safety forums. This practice helps in standardising safety 
measures and improving risk assessments across all properties.

contain the situation and prevent further harm. This might involve evacuating the area, administering first aid, 
or shutting down affected systems.
	
−
Incident Investigation: A thorough investigation is conducted to understand the root cause of the incident. This 
typically involves interviewing witnesses, examining the incident site, and reviewing relevant surveillance footage 
and equipment logs.
	
−
Development of Corrective Action Plans: Based on the investigation findings, corrective action plans are 
formulated. These plans are designed to address the specific causes of the incident and may include repairs or 
modifications to equipment, changes in operating procedures, or updates to safety training programmes.

impact and likelihood of occurrence. Priority is given to risks that pose the greatest threat to health and safety.
	
−
Development of Mitigation Strategies: For each significant risk, specific mitigation strategies are developed. These 
strategies include engineering controls (such as redesigning equipment or installing safety barriers), administrative 
controls (such as revising work procedures or limiting exposure times), and personal protective equipment.
	
−
Training and Communication: Employees are trained on the new safety measures and the reasons behind 
the changes. Effective communication ensures that all staff understand their roles in maintaining a safe 
work environment.

The IHCL Business Continuity and Disaster Response Plan has been developed to safeguard the smooth operation of 
critical business functions and ensure the well-being of guests and employees during disruptive incidents or disasters. 
It is inspired from the ‘Tata Disaster Response Guidelines’ https://www.tatasustainability.com/pdfs/Highlights/
TataDisasterResponseGuidelines.pdf.
	
The plan includes an assessment of potential risks and their potential impact on the business. It prioritises and 
allocates resources through a risk assessment process, and strategies are formulated to mitigate, transfer, or accept 
risks. Detailed plans have been devised for each critical business function, identifying key personnel who are trained 
in their roles and responsibilities. The plan features emergency protocols for immediate response, employee actions, 
evacuation, sheltering, and effective communication with guests and authorities. It also outlines procedures for 
damage assessment, property restoration, and recovery.

Also making sure glass bottles are returned to refurbish them in our plant which reduces the waste generated. Additionally, 
sourcing wooden and paper amenities from vendors.
Food Waste
We have set up organic waste composters or converters in most of our hotel locations so that wet waste is handled 
internally and not outsourced through third party. Currently we have 25 Organic Waste Treatment Systems (OWC/Biogas).

Measurement of certain amounts and BRSR Core metrics, some of which are estimates, is subject to substantial inherent 
measurement uncertainty, for example, GHG emissions, water footprint, energy footprint. Obtaining sufficient appropriate 
evidence to support our opinion/conclusion does not reduce the uncertainty in the amounts and metrics. 
Our responsibilities
We are responsible for:
	
−Planning and performing the engagement to obtain reasonable assurance on the sustainability disclosures in the BRSR 
Core are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, in accordance with the Reporting Criteria in 
line with the section above.
	
−Forming an independent opinion, based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, and

assurance opinion. The nature, timing, and extent of the procedures selected depended on our judgment, including an 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the information subject to reasonable assurance, whether due to fraud 
or error. We identified and assessed the risks of material misstatement through understanding the Information subject 
to reasonable assurance and the engagement circumstances. We also obtained an understanding of the internal control 
relevant to the information subject to reasonable assurance in order to design procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal controls.
