Legal and 
Regulatory 
changes 
Risk
Legal and regulatory changes in 
the regions where the company 
operates can significantly impact 
its operations and financial 
performance. These changes 
could lead to higher operating 
costs, increased taxation rates, 
restrictions on activities such as 
changes in legislation affecting 
business practices, or even 
bans on certain operations. It’s 
essential for the company to 
closely monitor and adapt to 
these regulatory environments 
to mitigate potential negative 
impacts 
on 
its 
business 
operations 
and 
financial 
outcomes. RGL operates in 
various territories and markets, 
each having its own regulatory 
systems, which continuously 
evolves changes, and undergoes 
increased scrutiny from the 
regulators. Any noncompliance 
with regulations or scrutiny 
process can result in dilution of 
financial position or jeopardize 
the Company’s reputation.
Regulatory risks are managed 
through a strong governance 
mechanism based on the 
philosophy of ‘zero tolerance 
to non-compliance’. This is 
implemented through:
z Monitoring of Legal 
and regulatory 
compliance by Senior 
management and the Board.
z Assessment of regulatory and 
compliance 
requirements 
on regular basis.
z Compliance 
management 
systems 
and 
continuous monitoring.
z Independent 
assessments and audits.
z Robust internal controls.

Environmental 
Impacts in 
the Supply Chain
Risk
The 
jewellery 
and 
lifestyle 
products industry often relies on 
raw materials such as metals and 
gemstones, which are extracted 
through processes that can 
have significant environmental 
consequences, including habitat 
destruction, 
water 
pollution, 
and carbon emissions. Any 
disruption 
or 
depletion 
of 
these natural resources can 
directly impact the Company’s 
ability to source materials for 
its products, leading to supply 
chain disruptions and increased 
costs. The use of hazardous 
chemicals in the manufacturing 
process 
can 
contribute 
to 
pollution and environmental 
degradation, 
potentially 
resulting in regulatory non-
compliance and reputational 
damage for the Company.
RGL 
strives 
to 
maintain 
compliance 
with 
ESG/ 
responsible products to promote 
sustainable 
development 
within 
communities. 
Management 
efforts 
may 
encompass screening, selecting, 
monitoring, 
and 
engaging 
with suppliers to assess and 
address 
their 
environmental 
impacts. The company also 
Continuously 
engage 
with 
suppliers for identifying any 
new threats/better options to 
mitigate the risks.
RGL monitors its Emissions, 
water 
consumption 
and 
waste generation;
Pro-actively work on emerging 
areas and implementation. The 
Company continues to monitor 
all 
emerging 
regulations, 
incidents, developments and 
map it for compliance.

Labour 
Conditions in 
the Supply Chain
Opportunity
The challenges include various 
aspects such as ensuring the 
health and safety of employees, 
fair compensation, combating 
child and forced labour. The 
complexity 
of 
the 
supply 
chain, involving multiple tiers 
of suppliers, subcontractors, 
and 
part-time 
workers, 
complicates the management 
of these issues. Due to the 
tendency to contract with 
suppliers in countries with 
lower costs, manufacturing 
often occurs in regions with 
limited worker protections. 
This poses reputational risks 
for companies, especially in 
light of increasing regulations 
and enforcement measures. 
This can be an opportunity as 
dealing with the issues would 
enhance 
transparency 
and 
traceability in the supply chain.

8. 
Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant indiscrimination and harassment cases.
The company maintains a zero-tolerance policy toward any form of retaliatory action or behavior. This commitment is reflected 
in various policies, including the Code of Conduct, Employee Manuals, Prevention of Sexual Harassment (POSH) policy, and the 
Whistle-blower Policy.
Under the POSH policy, the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) is chaired by a senior manager or higher, with a minimum 
of 2-3 years of experience within the company. These presiding officers bring both experience and a deep understanding of 
the company's context to handle sexual harassment cases effectively. The action taken against an employee in POSH cases is 
determined in consultation with an external ICC member, who brings expertise and experience from handling similar cases 
in other organizations, ensuring appropriate action based on the case's specifics. The ICC ensures that the Principle of Natural 
Justice is upheld throughout the process.
The Whistle-blower Policy offers the following protections:
- 
Whistle-blower complaints are considered protected disclosures, and the complainant can opt to remain anonymous.
- 
The investigating officer is responsible for safeguarding the whistle-blower's identity.
- 
 Whistle-blowers are shielded from any adverse actions, including harassment, unfair termination, demotion, suspension, 
or biased behavior, due to their disclosure.
9.

 Though we currently do not have a ZLD mechanism installed in our premises but we are looking forward towards other water 
treatment methods, the Hand Wash Water Treatment Plant (ETP) settles suspended solid precious metal particles from our 
production waste. Wastewater from various departments is directed to three interconnected settling tanks. In the first tank, 
alum and polyelectrolyte are continuously added to settle particles. The water then moves through the second and third tanks. 
The third tank has a level controller that activates a pump to pass water through a charcoal column and filter cartridges of 30, 15, 
and 1 microns. Sodium hypochlorite is added at the outlet to control COD and BOD. Tanks are emptied quarterly, and the slurry 
is collected. Regular monitoring and recording of chemical additions ensure efficient operation.

 Renaissance Global Ltd. is committed to preventing the release of hazardous substances without proper neutralization. 
Key hazardous substances, such as plating chemicals, are managed through rigorous processes. Cyanide effluent, whether 
airborne, liquid, or solid, is neutralized appropriately. Airborne cyanide is addressed with detection units and scrubbers, while 
liquid cyanide from plating operations is treated with ferrous sulfate and oxidized for safe disposal. Solid waste is minimized 
through careful stock management. Additionally, a Cyanide Antidote Kit is maintained for emergencies. The company's SOP 
ensures the safe handling, storage, and disposal of hazardous chemicals, with each chemical undergoing a risk assessment and 
MSDS obtained before procurement. Hazardous substances are stored in designated areas, and regular risk assessments and

Minor spills are managed by trained staff, while major spills require evacuation and external help. Proper labelling and disposal 
practices ensure efficient hazardous waste management.

1.
Wastewater Treatment
As part of our environmental sustainability initiatives, 
we have established an Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) to 
ensure that wastewater is treated effectively before being 
discharged. The treated water undergoes rigorous pH level 
monitoring on a regular basis. This proactive approach 
ensures that the water meets all regulatory standards before 
it is released into the corporation’s drainage system, thereby 
safeguarding the environment and promoting responsible 
water management practices.
Through the establishment of 
the Effluent Treatment Plant 
(ETP) and consistent pH level 
monitoring, 
around 
45% 
of 
the 
total 
water 
withdrawal 
is 
successfully 
treated. 
This process ensures that the 
treated water complies with all 
regulatory standards prior to its 
discharge into the corporation's 
drainage system.

Maintenance of 
Stack scrubbers to 
reduce Air emissions
To keep our emission parameters within the 
prescribed 
limits, 
we 
regularly 
monitor 
the 
operations of our stack scrubbers. Additionally, we 
maintain our scrubbers on a regular basis to ensure 
their optimal performance. 
They 
are 
quarterly 
monitored 
which 
has 
helped in in minimizing 
emissions and adhering to 
environmental standards.
3.
Use of Renewable energy
As part of our commitment to sustainability, we are 
actively pursuing initiatives to purchase renewable 
energy from third-party sources. This includes
