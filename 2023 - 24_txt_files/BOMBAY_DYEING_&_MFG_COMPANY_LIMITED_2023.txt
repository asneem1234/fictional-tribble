Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report
ABOUT US
The Bombay Dyeing and Manufacturing Company Ltd. (hereinafter 
referred to as “Bombay Dyeing” or the “Company”) is one of the Wadia 
group company. Operating primarily in the Polyester, Realty and Retail 
segments.
At Bombay Dyeing, we uphold the ethos of collaboration and 
empowerment among our stakeholders, fostering a culture rooted in 
transparency and accountability. We perceive our role in sustainable 
development not merely as a societal obligation but also as an 
avenue for mutual prosperity. By embracing sustainable practices and 
surpassing basic regulatory mandates, we endeavour to safeguard and 
enhance value for all stakeholders.
We endorse the reporting framework ‘Business Responsibility and 
Sustainability Report’ (“BRSR”) introduced by the Securities and 
Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”), which entails comprehensive 
disclosures on Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) aspects.
THE JOURNEY FROM BRSR FY 22-23 REPORTING TO THE BRSR 
FY 23-24
As we chart our course into the future, our company remains firmly 
committed to enhancing our environmental, social and governance 
(ESG) performance. Recognizing the imperative to align with 
global sustainability goals, we have dedicatedly transitioned from 
BRSR 2022-23 reporting to the more comprehensive framework of 
2023-24 reporting. This shift underscores our unwavering focus on 
transparency and accountability across all aspects of our operations. 
From meticulously tracking emissions and implementing innovative 
solutions to reduce our carbon footprint, to fostering robust employee 
engagement initiatives that prioritize well-being and inclusivity, and 
upholding the highest standards of corporate governance, we are 
steadfast in our pursuit of sustainable practices. By embracing the 
principles of ESG, we not only mitigate risks and create long-term value 
but also contribute positively to the communities and environments 
in which we operate. This forward-looking approach underscores our 
commitment to responsible business practices that drive positive 
change for generations to come.
A STEP FORWARD TOWARDS WELL-BEING:
Championing employee wellness, The Company is dedicated to the 
well-being of its workforce and their families. As part of Republic 
Day – 2024 celebration, Bombay Dyeing PSF plant on January 27th, 
2024 organized a 5 KM short marathon aimed at enhancing the health 
and awareness of employees and their families residing at the housing 
colonies of the plant. The theme of the marathon was “One Step towards 
Fitness,” emphasizing the importance of physical well-being. Prior to 
the marathon, participants engaged in a fitness session highlighting 
the significance of such activities.
Upon completion of the marathon, medals were awarded to all 
participants. Additionally, the Company arranged a cricket match for 
family members of the plant employees on the same date.
Local newspapers and TV channels took note of these events, particularly 
focusing on the marathon, showcasing the community’s engagement 
and commitment to health and fitness.

Plastic waste 
Management
Risk
The Plastic Waste Management Rules of 2016, along with its 2024 
amendment, as well as various state-level regulations concerning 
plastic consumption and waste management, pose significant 
challenges to companies operating nationwide. These regulations 
impose responsibilities on companies to collect and appropriately 
dispose of plastic waste generated through packaging. This means 
that businesses must now take proactive measures to manage the 
plastic waste they generate, ensuring compliance with evolving 
legislation aimed at mitigating the environmental impact of plastic 
usage. Such regulations necessitate robust waste management 
systems and increased accountability, adding complexity to the 
operations of companies operating across India.
The Company is actively working to adjust its 
practices in response to the evolving regulations 
surrounding the management of plastic waste. 
With a commitment to staying well-informed 
of regulatory changes, we are proactively 
implementing measures to ensure compliance 
and minimize our environmental impact. This 
includes investing in innovative solutions for 
plastic waste management, such as recycling 
initiatives and the development of sustainable 
packaging alternatives.

Opportunity
The importance of enhancing energy and water efficiency presents 
companies with valuable opportunities to stimulate demand 
within their target market, potentially resulting in increased 
revenue and/or improved profit margins. By prioritizing efficiency 
measures, businesses can not only meet consumer expectations 
for sustainable practices but also differentiate themselves in a 
competitive landscape. Moreover, investing in energy and water 
efficiency not only benefits the environment but also enhances 
operational efficiency and cost savings, further strengthening the 
company’s bottom line.

Opportunity
The development of residential areas plays a crucial role in fostering 
economic growth and improving employment opportunities within 
communities. Moreover, it serves to counteract potential increases 
in the cost of living by providing more housing options. Beyond 
economic considerations, residential advancement contributes to 
the creation of secure and vibrant neighborhoods, enhancing overall 
community well-being.

Alteration of

Opportunity
In the event that anticipated production goals and targets are 
not met, it becomes essential for manufacturing firms to enact 
adjustments to sustain their business growth trajectory and uphold 
connections with consumers. These adjustments may encompass 
various aspects of operations, such as optimizing production 
processes, revising supply chain strategies, or enhancing product 
offerings to better align with market demands. By promptly 
adapting to changing circumstances and market dynamics, 
companies can ensure continued relevance and competitiveness, 
fostering enduring relationships with their customer base while 
striving towards sustained expansion and success in the industry.
Not Applicable 
Positive 
5
Rising of 
price of raw 
material
Risk
The main sectors within the PSF (Polyester Staple Fibre) division 
demonstrate a significant dependency on both fluctuations in crude 
oil prices and the accessibility of the cotton crop. This reliance 
underscores the intricate interplay between raw material costs 
and agricultural factors, which directly impact the operations 
and profitability of these segments. Fluctuations in crude oil 
prices influence the cost of producing synthetic fibres, while the 
availability and quality of the cotton crop affect the supply and 
pricing dynamics of natural fibres. 
The company is managing risks by closely 
monitoring the fluctuations in the exchange 
rate between the Indian Rupee and the US 
Dollar, aiming to minimize the impact on its 
business.
Negative 
*There was no negative financial 
impact in the reporting period 
of FY 2023-24.
6
Environmental 
impacts in 
supply chain 
Risk
Environmental impacts within the supply chain can pose a 
significant material risk for the Company. As a textile manufacturer, 
the company relies on various resources such as water, energy, 
and raw materials, which may have detrimental effects on the 
environment if not managed responsibly. Issues like pollution, 
resource depletion, and carbon emissions throughout the 
supply chain can lead to regulatory fines, reputational damage, 
and increased operational costs. Moreover, as environmental 
consciousness grows among consumers and stakeholders, failure 
to address these impacts could result in reduced demand for the 
company’s products and potential loss of market share.
The Company is dedicated to ensuring a 
positive environmental impact throughout 
its supply chain. By adhering to all relevant 
environmental rules and regulations, the 
company demonstrates its commitment to 
responsible stewardship of natural resources.
Negative 
*There was no negative financial 
impact in the reporting period 
of FY 2023-24.
	
	
Note: Material issues identified are referred from the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) 2023-2024 version. SASB 
Standards are maintained and enhanced by the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB). This follows the SASB’s merger 
with the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) into the Value Reporting Foundation (VRF) and subsequent consolidation 
into the IFRS Foundation in 2022.

We harness solar energy as a natural resource through a 50KWP solar PV Plant integrated into the canteen terrace area. The generated 
solar power is utilized in the administrative building and canteen, contributing to 0.06% of our renewable energy usage.
	
Õ	
Implementation of transparent roof sheets in new storage areas, coal shed, and compressor areas has resulted in reduced reliance on 
electrical power by utilizing natural sunlight during the day.
	
Õ	
Installation of 50 Turbo Ventilators across the Warehouse, Compressor House, Coal Shed, Workshop, and Store Rooftops to enhance 
natural ventilation.
	
Õ	
Adoption of solar water heaters in the Guest House and Canteen areas as an alternative to electric heaters.
C.	
STEAM TURBINE ENERGY GENERATION
	
Õ	
High-pressure steam, generated in our boiler at 25 Kg/cm2, is utilized in the PSF plant as both high pressure (25 Kg/cm2) and 
low pressure (3.5 Kg/cm2) steam. Initially, the high-pressure steam is converted to low-pressure steam through the PRD system. 
Subsequently, the PRD system is replaced by a steam turbine system, where electrical energy is generated and utilized in the PSF plant 
for its operations.
