Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases.
In adherence to regulatory mandates, the PEL Group has instituted a whistle blower mechanism and created a corresponding Whistle 
Blower Policy (“Policy”) to provide a structured and secure framework for responsible and secure whistle blowing/ vigilance. The policy, 
influenced by the Group’s philosophy of Knowledge, Action and Care, supports the Group in upholding high moral standards, financial 
integrity, transparency, and good governance in its business operations.
Directors, employees, customers, and all other stakeholders have the ability under the Policy to report concerns about unethical behavior, 
actual or suspected fraud or violation of the Code of Conduct or Policy. We support and encourage anyone with legitimate concerns about 
suspected misconduct to voice these concerns without fear of retaliation or unfair treatment. The PEL Group understands some violations 
may dissuade open communication from employees. Therefore, this Policy serves as an additional communication channel, supplementing 
the regular management hierarchy, so that all employees, irrespective of their position, can express their concerns.
The mechanism provides for safeguards against victimization of whistle blowers who avail of this mechanism and provides for direct access 
to the Whistle Blower Committee or Investigating Officer / Internal Audit / Independent Firm appointed by the Whistle Blower Committee 
of the Company. However, this does not release the employees from their duty of confidentiality in their course of work nor can it be used 
as a route for any Malicious Complaints.
The Policy covers all malpractices and all unethical, illegal or improper activities which have taken place / suspected to have taken place, 
including but not limited to abuse of authority, negligence causing substantial and specific danger to public health and safety, financial 
irregularities including fraud or suspected fraud, criminal offence, perforation of confidential / proprietary information, misappropriation of 
company funds / property, breach of Code of Conduct and any other unethical or immoral or illegal events.
All protected disclosures under the Policy are documented and thoroughly investigated by either an Investigating Officer/Internal Audit/
Independent Firm appointed by the Whistle Blower Committee. Investigations are neutral fact-finding processes, not accusations, and 
investigators must maintain fairness, objectivity, and ethical behavior while abiding by legal and professional norms.
	
Post investigation, the Whistle Blower Committee submits a confidential report to the Audit Committee Chairman. The Audit Committee 
reviews these reports and provides its recommendations. If investigation disproves a good faith disclosure by a whistle blower, no action is 
taken against them.

Furthermore, the Group has implemented a strong policy to prevent sexual harassment in the workplace that aligns with the guidelines 
set forth by The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013. The Group has adhered to 
the regulations related to the formation of an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) under this act to address complaints related to sexual 
harassment. This policy applies to all employees including permanent, contractual, temporary, and trainees.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details.
	
The bulk of the emission stems from electricity (Scope 2) and fuel consumption of the group-owned vehicles (Scope 1). Addressing its 
electricity consumption, the corporate office in Bangalore has installed a 27.5 kW solar plant, which help reduce GHG emissions by meeting a 
portion of its energy demands. The corporate office in Kurla (Mumbai) utilizes renewable energy to meet part of its electricity requirements. 
The PEL Group’s has installed energy-efficient LED lighting and signage boards. Moreover, inverter air-conditioning units with R-22 refrigerant 
are installed in all new branches to minimize GHG emissions. The PEL Group is internally assessing the potential for efficient equipment and 
alternative energy sources at branch offices. The Group’s use of video conferencing technologies decreases air travel for employees and the 
corresponding emissions. Additionally, the Company is making efforts to digitize operations and procedures wherever viable. Collaborations 
have been initiated with air travel booking vendors to gauge travel emissions.
	
The PEL Group actively monitors emissions and energy consumption patterns to identify energy-saving opportunities. The Piramal Finance 
office at Agastya building in Kurla Mumbai has been applied for IGBC Platinum certification this year due to its environmental performance.
