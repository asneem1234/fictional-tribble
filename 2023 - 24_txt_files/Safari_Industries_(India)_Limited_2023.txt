STATEMENT ON CONSERVATION OF ENERGY, TECHNOLOGY ABSORPTION & 
FOREIGN EXCHANGE EARNINGS AND OUTGO
A.	 CONSERVATION OF ENERGY:
	
(i)	 The steps taken or impact on conservation 
of energy:
	
	
a.	
Modification in Water Pump System of 
Cooling Tower:
	
	
	
The replacement of the 7.5 kW submersible 
water pump with a 5.5 kW mono block water 
pump resulted in significant energy savings 
and operational efficiency. By reducing the 
energy consumption from 180 kWh to 132 
kWh per day, the project achieved notable 
reductions in energy use, contributing to our 
energy conservation efforts. Additionally, 
the new pump required less manpower 
for maintenance, further enhancing the 
efficiency of the cooling tower system.
	
	
b.	
Modification made to CNC machine to 
address energy consumption:
	
	
	
The original design featured a continuously 
running vacuum blower, even during 
idle period which resulted in additional 
unnecessary 
energy 
consumption. 
To address this inefficiency, an initiative was 
undertaken to implement an on/off switch 
for the blower, allowing operators to shut 
it down when not in use. This modification 
in the CNC system led to energy savings, 
reducing annual electricity consumption by 
22,176 kWh units.
	
(ii)	 The steps taken by the Company for 
utilizing alternate sources of energy:
	
	
a)	
The Company has taken a commendable 
step towards sustainability and energy 
independence by installing a 1MW solar 
rooftop photovoltaic (PV) system at Safari 
Manufacturing 
Limited 
(SML), 
wholly 
owned subsidiary’s factory. This initiative 
showcases a strategic move to leverage 
underutilized rooftop space for generating 
renewable energy, which aligns with the 
Company’s sustainability strategy to use 
renewable energy and reduce operational 
GHG 
emissions. 
In 
FY 
2024, 
on-site 
renewable energy generation was 3,80,351 
kWh contributing 7.8% renewable energy 
share of the total energy consumption at 
the SML plant. Additionally, the energy 
consumption 
through 
solar 
PV 
has 
helped reduce 272 tCO2e GHG emissions. 
This initiative has reduced our reliance on 
grid electricity and lowering our energy 
costs. Moreover, it allows us to produce our 
own clean power and potentially supply 
excess electricity back to the grid, creating 
an additional revenue stream and providing 
long-term financial benefits.
	
	
b)	
The manufacturing facilities do not use 
diesel generators (DG sets) due to a 
strategic decision to rely solely on electricity. 
This approach ensures the non-reliance on 
fossil fuels, thereby avoiding greenhouse gas 
emissions and promoting a more sustainable 
and environmentally friendly operation.
	
(iii)	Capital Investment on energy conservation 
equipment: Nil
B.	
TECHNOLOGY ABSORPTION:
	
(i)	 Efforts 
made 
towards 
technology 
absorption:
	
	
Transitioned from three-stage thermoforming 
machines 
to 
more 
advanced 
two-stage 
thermoforming machines. This technological 
shift was taken to enhance production efficiency 
and sustainability. In a three-stage machine, the 
process typically involves heating the plastic 
sheet, forming it to the desired shape, and then 
trimming the formed product. The two-stage 
machines, however, combine the forming and 
trimming stages into one, thereby reducing 
the overall cycle time and energy consumption. 
By adopting this technology, we achieved 
a reduction in the size of the plastic sheets 
required for the hard luggage production and 
reducing the offcut generation. Furthermore, the 
reduction in sheet size and offcut generation 
has resulted in a decrease in the electricity 
consumption per unit of luggage produced and 
increased extruder capacity.

(ii)	 The 
benefits 
derived 
like 
product 
improvement, 
cost 
reduction, 
product 
development or import substitution:
	
	
Safari Manufacturing Limited, wholly owned 
subsidiary 
produces 
in-house 
components 
for luggage: Due to delays in part supplies 
from local vendors and volatile pricing of 
imported components, the Company decided 
to develop an ancillary manufacturing unit that 
produces in-house components such as wheels. 
This strategic move enabled more flexible 
production planning, minimized supply-chain 
disruptions, reduced import costs, and decreased 
associated value chain emissions. This transition 
to in-house production has proved to be a 
valuable strategy for the Company, streamlining 
the supply chain and reducing production delays 
while contributing to sustainability goals.

during the last three years reckoned from

STATUTORY REPORTS
STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
A.	 Industry Structure and Developments:
	
The post-pandemic period saw high levels of growth 
in the industry for a sustained period especially for the 
organised sector with more consumers travelling and 
travelling more frequently. With the normalisation of 
this trend at a significantly higher base of consumers, 
the industry has now returned to its long-term 
growth trajectory of 10-12%. This long-term growth 
rate is expected to sustain as young demographics 
and increase in affluence levels continue to add new 
consumers to the market, and consumers continue to 
upgrade to branded luggage.
	
The growth in the Backpack segment has also 
normalised with a second full-year of mostly pervasive 
physical presence in schools and offices.
	
With the large-scale digitisation of the economy 
and steadily increasing penetration, the E-commerce 
channel continued to lead the category growth. 
The channel continued to serve as a vehicle to drive 
deeper geographic penetration for branded bags, 
where presence of offline branded channels is limited. 
While the online traffic growth in channel has muted 
down after the explosive increase post-pandemic, the 
channel is expected to continue to maintain its pole 
position as a growth driver for the foreseeable future.
	
In the post-pandemic period, China imports for the 
unorganised sector had become largely unviable. 
These unorganised players are now seeing some 
resurgence with increased local manufacturing 
of hard-luggage. This is expected to put pressure 
on organised sector growth in offline channels, 
especially general trade.
	
The overall long-term outlook for the organised 
sector remains very robust with continued growth in 
travel, increasing preference for branded luggage, 
growth in school and office going population.
	
Company Development:
	
The Company continued to grow ahead of the 
market led by a well-defined portfolio catering 
well to diverse consumer needs and strong go-to-
market strategy. As a testimony to this consistent 
performance, the Safari brand has been adjudged as 
the ‘No. 1 Luggage Brand in India’ in revenue terms 
(Source: Euromonitor International Limited; Personal 
Accessories 2024 ed; Luggage category; gbn; all retail 
channel, value rsp terms; 2023 data).
	
In order to meet the rising demand for hard luggage, 
the Company has further scaled up capacity for 
ANNEXURE H
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS REPORT
both polypropylene and polycarbonate zippered 
hard luggage in its two manufacturing plants based 
in Halol, Gujarat. The Company’s wholly owned 
subsidiary i.e. Safari Manufacturing Limited is further 
in the process of setting up a new greenfield project 
for production of hard luggage in Jaipur, Rajasthan.
	
To tap into the rising premium tier opportunity 
in the market, the Company has launched a new 
brand, Urban Jungle, in the casual premium segment. 
This brand was first test launched in the zippered hard 
luggage category. After receiving a good consumer 
response that brand is now being scaled-up across 
backpacks and accessories. The brand is focussed on 
younger consumers and will drive its brand building 
efforts primarily via strong advertising and content 
presence on digital platforms.
	
The Company continued to add retail stores in 
prestigious high footfall locations across chosen 
target markets. These exclusive retail stores have the 
twin objective of building consumer equity as well as 
improving the premium sales mix. The International 
Business division of the Company continued to grow 
with a focus on West Asian countries with large Indian 
diaspora, taking advantage of the latent equity of 
the ‘Safari’ brand in this segment.
	
During the year, the Company has also successfully 
implemented SAP 2022 version. This upgradation 
project will enable the Company with the latest 
technology platform, give competitive advantage and 
facilitate all new integrations with latest platforms, 
marketplaces, automations & data analytics.
B.	
Opportunities and Threats:
	
In the post-pandemic period, the industry has seen 
a structural shift towards domestic manufacturing 
helped by the sharp growth in the hard luggage 
category. With timely investments in scaling up of 
hard luggage capacity, the Company has been able to 
capitalise on this shift in demand. It will be imperative 
for the Company to continue to assess and plan for 
such shifts in consumer tastes and trends in the future.
	
The 
premium 
segment 
is 
seeing 
increased 
competitive intensity with the gradual scale-up 
of several new brands in the segment. The larger 
bouquet of choices is generating increased consumer 
interest for the category, with a certain segment 
of discerning consumer consciously looking for 
fresher and contemporary aesthetics. This presents 
an opportunity to drive growth for any brand that 
innovates on design aesthetics to stay relevant to 
44
ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24
changing consumer tastes. The overall GDP growth 
of the country and rising affluence of the Indian 
middle-class, will lead to a faster than market 
growth this segment.
	
Through aggressive and consistent investment, the 
Company has built a strong position in E-commerce 
channel. With E-commerce continuing to be a lead 
growth channel and rapid changes in consumer 
behaviours in the digital arena, it is critical for the 
Company to build expertise and invest aggressively in 
this area for continued growth.
	
With tempering down of industry growth, the price 
competition in the category has been increasing. 
With its frugal approach towards costs and improved 
hard luggage mix, the Company has been able to 
sustain profitable growth. With the risk of a global 
slowdown and tempering down of demand growth 
in the domestic market, to continue to outperform 
the market and maintaining profitable growth is the 
most important medium-term challenge.
	
While the overall growth for the domestic economy 
and travel sub-sector continues to be strong, the 
Company’s linear structure facilitates faster and 
better decision making which allows the Company to 
grab opportunities in time.
C.	
Segment/ Product-wise Performance:
	
The 
consumer 
shift 
away 
from 
soft-luggage 
accelerated during the year with a sharp drop in 
demand for this category, driven by increasing 
preference for more premium looking and durable 
hard-luggage products. Given this sharp shift in 
consumer preference, hard luggage manufacturing 
capacity 
across 
the 
industry 
remained 
tight. 
The Company continued to invest in zippered hard 
luggage by continuing to expand its range of zippered 
cases in both polycarbonate and polypropylene.
	
While the Company has grown well in the backpack 
category, the huge numeric potential for the 
category continues to be untapped by the organised 
sector. This category is increasingly getting more 
fragmented with increasing number of local as 
well as new age start-ups. It is important to drive a 
strong focus on product and brand innovation in the 
category to break-through the clutter. The Company 
will continue to invest aggressively behind this 
category as a strong growth driver.
D.	 Outlook:
	
The Company has continued to grow ahead of 
the market, with future uncertainties around the 
demand side, it will be imperative for the Company 
to stay focussed on identified channels, categories 
and consumer segments that are expected to 
drive market growth.
	
The Company has further optimised its supply 
chain for better responsiveness and cost, by 
investments in modern technology in the areas 
of ERP, warehousing and planning capability. 
Given the focus on e-commerce and direct-to-
consumer channels, the Company will continue to 
undertake focussed investments to make its supply 
chain more robust and future-ready in dealing with 
their unique requirements.
	
The rising potential of premium category presents 
a large opportunity of the Company. It is important 
for the Company to invest aggressively in building 
its share in this category to drive future growth 
and improve its price realisation through product 
mix improvement.
	
While there continue to be some uncertainties, 
the overall growth drivers are well in place for the 
Company to continue on a high growth trajectory 
with improving profitability.
E.	
Risks and Concerns:
	
The Company is exposed to various risks and 
uncertainties which may adversely impact its 
performance. The Company’s future growth prospects 
and cash flow generation could be materially 
impacted by any of these risks or opportunities. 
The major risks as identified by the Company are 
demand-risks due to recessionary trends in the global 
economy, currency risk associated with imports, 
unfair competition, etc.
	
The Company follows the Enterprise Risk Management 
(ERM) framework to manage and mitigate such risks 
which is primarily based on the integrated framework 
for enterprise risk management and internal controls 
developed by the Company.
F.	
Internal Control Systems and their adequacy:
	
M/s. Moore Singhi Advisors LLP were appointed 
as the Internal Auditors of the Company to review 
internal controls periodically with specific reference 
to evaluation of the current business processes, 
identify gaps, inefficiencies, process exceptions 
and suggest action plans, verify adherence to risk 
mitigation plans, to review sourcing and supply chain 
management, plant operations and effectiveness, 
sales planning and distribution channels, branches 
of the Company, warehouse and retail operations, 
to provide assurance regarding various compliances 
by assessing the reliability of financial controls and 
IT controls and compliance with applicable laws and 
regulations. The Company has a regular check on 
expenses including capital expenditure. The Company 
has documented policies and SOPs with regards to 
all major activities. The Internal Auditors submit 
their reports to the Audit Committee quarterly.

Consumers are increasingly aware of environmental issues and tend to favor

resource efficiency, Safari can enhance its brand image, attract eco-conscious 
customers, and differentiate itself from competitors.
Regulatory bodies are imposing stricter regulations on resource usage and 
waste management. Proactively adopting resource-efficient practices can help 
Safari stay ahead of regulations, avoid potential fines, and reduce the risk of 
resource-related disruptions.
Investing in resource-efficient technologies can spur innovation, leading to the 
development of new, sustainable products. This can open up new markets and

from companies perceived to be violating these rights. This can affect sales and 
brand loyalty.
Any association with human rights abuses can severely damage the Company’s 
brand image and market position, leading to a loss of consumer trust and a 
decrease in market share.

Compliance 
& Risk 
Management
Risk
The luggage and travel accessories industry is subject to various regulations, 
including those related to safety, labor, and environmental standards. Safari 
must continuously monitor these regulations to ensure compliance.
Compliance and risk management involve safeguarding against operational 
risks such as supply chain disruptions, quality control issues, and technological 
failures. For Safari, which relies on a network of suppliers and complex 
manufacturing processes, these risks can impact production and affect the 
Company’s ability to meet customer demand.
Non-compliance with industry standards or ethical norms can lead to 
reputational damage. For a consumer-facing brand like Safari, maintaining a 
positive reputation is crucial for customer trust and loyalty.
As environmental concerns become more prominent, companies are expected 
to manage their environmental impact. Safari must ensure compliance 
with environmental regulations to avoid penalties and align with consumer 
expectations for sustainable practices.
Ensuring compliance with labor laws and managing risks related to employee 
health and safety are essential. Any oversight can lead to legal challenges and 
affect employee morale.
The Company has a 
Risk Management 
Committee to ensure 
that appropriate 
methodologies processes 
and systems are in place 
to monitor and evaluate 
risks associated with 
its business operations. 
The Company follows 
the Enterprise 
Risk Management 
(ERM) framework to 
manage and mitigate 
such risks which is 
primarily based on the 
integrated framework 
for enterprise risk

internal controls

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide detail:
	
Company has undertaken the following initiatives/ improvements in operational mechanisms to reduce GHG 
emission by improving energy efficiency and reducing energy consumption:
	
•	
Safari has taken a commendable step towards sustainability and energy independence by installing a 1MW 
solar rooftop photovoltaic (PV) system at SML’s factory. This initiative showcases a strategic move to leverage 
underutilized rooftop space for generating renewable energy, which aligns with the Company’s sustainability 
strategy to use renewable energy and reduce operational GHG emissions. In FY 2023-24, on-site renewable 
energy generation was 3,80,351 kWh contributing 7.8% renewable energy share of the total energy 
consumption at the SML plant. Additionally, the energy consumption through solar PV has helped reduce 272 
tCO2e GHG emissions in FY 2023-24. This initiative has reduced our reliance on grid electricity and lowering our 
90
ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24
energy costs. Moreover, it allows us to produce our own clean power and potentially supply excess electricity 
back to the grid, creating an additional revenue stream and providing long-term financial benefits.
	
•	
The manufacturing facilities do not use diesel generators (DG sets) due to a strategic decision to rely solely on 
electricity. This approach ensures the non-reliance on fossil fuels, thereby avoiding greenhouse gas emissions 
and promoting a more sustainable and environmentally friendly operation.
	
•	
Replacing conventional lighting with energy efficient LED lighting: The manufacturing facilities have 
energy-efficient LED lighting instead of conventional lights. LED lights consume significantly less power and 
have a longer lifespan compared to traditional lighting solutions, contributing to substantial energy savings.
	
•	
The replacement of the 7.5 kW submersible water pump with a 5.5 kW mono block water pump resulted in 
significant energy savings and operational efficiency. By reducing the energy consumption from 180 kWh to 132 
kWh per day, the project achieved notable reductions in energy use, contributing to our energy conservation 
efforts. Additionally, the new pump required less manpower for maintenance, further enhancing the efficiency 
of the cooling tower system.
	
•	
The original design featured a continuously running vacuum blower, even during idle period which resulted in 
additional unnecessary energy consumption. To address this inefficiency, an initiative project was undertaken to 
implement an on/off switch for the blower, allowing operators to shut it down when not in use. This modification 
in the CNC system lead to energy savings, reducing annual electricity consumption by 22,176 kWh units.

In our opinion and to the best of our information 
and according to the explanations given to us, the 
aforesaid standalone financial statements give the 
information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (‘the 
Act’) in the manner so required and give a true and 
fair view in conformity with the Indian Accounting 
Standards (‘Ind AS’) specified under section 133 of 
the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting 
Standards) Rules, 2015 and other accounting 
principles generally accepted in India, of the state 
of affairs of the Company as at 31 March 2024, and 
its profit (including other comprehensive income), 
Independent Auditor’s Report
its cash flows and the changes in equity for the year 
ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
3.	
We conducted our audit in accordance with the 
Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) 
of the Act. Our responsibilities under those standards 
are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities 
for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements 
section of our report. We are independent of the 
Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics 
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of 
India (‘ICAI’) together with the ethical requirements 
that are relevant to our audit of the standalone 
financial statements under the provisions of the Act 
and the rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our 
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these 
requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that 
the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Key Audit Matter
4.	
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our 
professional judgment, were of most significance in 
our audit of the standalone financial statements of 
the current period. These matters were addressed in 
the context of our audit of the standalone financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion 
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion 
on these matters.
5.	
We have determined the matter described below to be the key audit matter to be communicated in our report.
Key audit matter
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Revenue Recognition under Ind AS 115, Revenue 
from Contracts with Customers (‘Ind AS 115’)
Refer note 2.9 – ‘Revenue recognition’ and note 25 
and 41 – ‘Revenue from operations’ to the standalone 
financial statements for the related accounting 
policy on revenue recognition and details of revenue 
recognised during the year.
Revenue for the Company consists primarily of sale 
of manufactured and traded goods. Owing to the 
multiplicity of the Company’s channels through 
which sale of products is made, and diverse 
terms of contracts with customers, revenue is 
determined to be an area involving significant risk 
and hence, requiring significant auditor attention. 
Our audit included, but was not limited to, the following 
procedures performed in respect of revenue recognition:
• 
Understood the process of revenue recognition and 
evaluated the appropriateness of the accounting 
policy adopted by the management on revenue 
recognition in accordance with Ind AS 115.
• 
Evaluated the design and tested the operating 
effectiveness of manual and information technology 
internal financial controls, including controls over 
identification of the distinct performance obligations, 
determination of transaction price and satisfaction 
of performance obligations. Procedures performed 
included enquiry, observation and inspection of 
evidence in respect of operation of these controls.
102
ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24
Key audit matter
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Further, the application of Ind AS 115 involves 
significant judgements / material estimates relating 
to 
identification 
of 
performance 
obligations, 
determination of transaction price, including impact 
of variable consideration in the form of rebates and 
discounts, assessment of satisfaction of the identified 
performance obligations represented by the transfer 
of control of the products sold.
Revenue is a key performance indicator and 
there is presumed fraud risk of revenue being 
overstated during the year on account of variation 
in the timing of transfer of control, due pressure 
to achieve performance targets and meeting the 
external expectations.
Owing to significance of amount, multiplicity of the 
Company’s channels through which sale of products 
is made, volume of transactions, nature of customer 
with varied terms of contracts, presumed fraud risk, 
audit of revenue recognized during the year requires 
significant 
auditor 
attention 
and 
accordingly, 
revenue recognition is considered to be a key audit 
matter for the current year audit.
• 
Selected channel-wise (e-commerce, hyper, trade, 
Central Police Canteen, Canteen Stores Department 
and other small channels)  samples of customers, and 
performed the following procedures:
	
1.	
Read, analysed and identified the distinct 
performance obligations in these contracts;
	
2.	
Compared 
such 
performance 
obligations 
with those identified and recorded by the 
management; and
	
3.	
Reviewed 
contract 
terms 
to 
determine 
the 
transaction 
price 
including 
variable 
consideration, 
if 
any, 
to 
determine 
the 
appropriate 
transaction 
price 
for 
measuring revenue.
• 
Tested, on a sample basis, revenue transactions 
recorded during the year, and in the period 
before and after year-end, relating to sale of 
products by inspecting supporting documents 
such as customer contracts, sales orders, proofs of 
dispatch, customer acceptance, invoices, etc., for the 
accuracy and completeness of revenue recorded for 
such transactions.
• 
Assessed the underlying assumptions used by 
the management for determination of variable 
consideration as at year end, as a result of rebates, 
discount rates, sales returns, etc., and traced inputs 
used to source data.
• 
Tested a sample of credit notes issued during the 
year and subsequent to year end to confirm revenue 
recognised during the period was appropriate.
• 
Performed analytical procedures for reasonableness 
of revenue recorded such as trend analysis by 
channel, by customer, etc.
• 
Assessed 
the 
appropriateness 
and 
adequacy 
of 
disclosures 
included 
in 
the 
standalone 
financial statements, in accordance with the 
requirements of Ind AS 115.
Information other than the Standalone Financial 
Statements and Auditor’s Report thereon
6.	
The Company’s Board of Directors are responsible 
for the other information. The other information 
comprises 
the 
information 
included 
in 
the 
Management Discussion and Analysis Report, Report 
on Corporate Governance, Directors’ Report, etc., but 
does not include the standalone financial statements 
and our auditor’s report thereon.
	
Our opinion on the standalone financial statements 
does not cover the other information and we do not 
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
	
In connection with our audit of the standalone 
financial statements, our responsibility is to read 
the other information and, in doing so, consider 
whether 
the 
other 
information 
is 
materially 
inconsistent with the standalone financial statements 
or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise 
appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the 
work we have performed, we conclude that there is a 
material misstatement of this other information, we 
are required to report that fact. We have nothing to 
report in this regard.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged 
with Governance for the Standalone Financial 
Statements
7.	
The accompanying standalone financial statements 
have been approved by the Company’s Board 
of Directors. The Company’s Board of Directors 
are responsible for the matters stated in section 
134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation 
and presentation of these standalone financial 
statements that give a true and fair view of the 
financial position, financial performance including 
other comprehensive income, changes in equity and 
cash flows of the Company in accordance with the 
Ind AS specified under section 133 of the Act and 
other accounting principles generally accepted in 
India. This responsibility also includes maintenance of 
adequate accounting records in accordance with the 
provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of 
the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds 
and other irregularities; selection and application of 
appropriate accounting policies; making judgments 
and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
and design, implementation and maintenance of 
adequate internal financial controls, that were 
operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and 
completeness of the accounting records, relevant to 
the preparation and presentation of the standalone 
financial statements that give a true and fair view 
and are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error.
8.	
In preparing the standalone financial statements, 
the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing 
the Company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related 
to going concern and using the going concern 
basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors 
either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease 
operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
9.	
The Board of Directors is also responsible for 
overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Standalone Financial Statements
10.	 Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the standalone financial statements as 
a whole are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report 
that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a 
high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that 
an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on 
Auditing will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or 
error and are considered material if, individually or 
in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected 
to influence the economic decisions of users taken on 
the basis of these standalone financial statements.
11.	 As part of an audit in accordance with Standards 
on Auditing, specified under section 143(10) of the 
Act we exercise professional judgment and maintain 
professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
 
• 
Identify and assess the risks of material 
misstatement 
of 
the 
standalone 
financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error, 
design and perform audit procedures responsive 
to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a 
material misstatement resulting from fraud 
is higher than for one resulting from error, as 
fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of 
internal control;
 
• 
Obtain an understanding of internal control 
relevant to the audit in order to design 
audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the 
Act we are also responsible for expressing our 
opinion on whether the Company has adequate 
internal financial controls with reference to 
standalone financial statements in place and the 
operating effectiveness of such controls;
 
• 
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting 
policies 
used 
and 
the 
reasonableness 
of 
accounting estimates and related disclosures 
made by management;
 
• 
Conclude on the appropriateness of Board of 
Directors’ use of the going concern basis of 
accounting and, based on the audit evidence 
obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists 
related to events or conditions that may cast 
significant doubt on the Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern. If we conclude that 
a material uncertainty exists, we are required 
to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the 
related disclosures in the standalone financial 
statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, 
to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based 
on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of 
our auditor’s report. However, future events or 
conditions may cause the Company to cease to 
continue as a going concern; and
 
• 
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and 
content of the standalone financial statements, 
including the disclosures, and whether the 
standalone financial statements represent the 
underlying transactions and events in a manner 
that achieves fair presentation.
12.	 We 
communicate 
with 
those 
charged 
with 
governance regarding, among other matters, the 
planned scope and timing of the audit and significant 
104
ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24
audit findings, including any significant deficiencies 
in internal control that we identify during our audit.
13.	 We also provide those charged with governance with 
a statement that we have complied with relevant 
ethical requirements regarding independence, and 
to communicate with them all relationships and 
other matters that may reasonably be thought to 
bear on our independence, and where applicable, 
related safeguards.
14.	 From the matters communicated with those charged 
with governance, we determine those matters 
that were of most significance in the audit of the 
standalone financial statements of the current period 
and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe 
these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or 
regulation precludes public disclosure about the 
matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we 
determine that a matter should not be communicated 
in our report because the adverse consequences of 
doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh 
the public interest benefits of such communication.
Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements
15.	 As required by section 197(16) of the Act based on 
our audit, we report that the Company has paid 
remuneration to its directors during the year in 
accordance with the provisions of and limits laid down 
under section 197 read with Schedule V to the Act.
16.	 As required by the Companies (Auditor’s Report) 
Order, 2020 (‘the Order’) issued by the Central 
Government of India in terms of section 143(11) of 
the Act we give in the Annexure A, a statement on 
the matters specified in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the 
Order, to the extent applicable.

2014 (as amended);
	
c)	
The standalone financial statements dealt

books of account;

section 133 of the Act;

received from the directors and taken on record 
by the Board of Directors, none of the directors 
is disqualified as on 31 March 2024 from being

164(2) of the Act;
	
f)	
The modification relating to the maintenance 
of accounts and other matters connected 
therewith are as stated in paragraph 17(b) above 
on reporting under section 143(3)(b) of the Act 
and paragraph 17(h)(vi) below on reporting 
under Rule 11(g) of the Companies (Audit and 
Auditors) Rules, 2014 (as amended);

financial controls with reference to standalone 
financial statements of the Company as on 31

of such controls, refer to our separate report 
in Annexure B wherein we have expressed an 
unmodified opinion; and
	
h)	
With respect to the other matters to be included

the standalone financial statements, has 
disclosed the impact of pending litigations

contracts including derivative contracts for

There has been no delay in transferring 
amounts, required to be transferred, to

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24
In terms of the information and explanations sought by us 
and given by the Company and the books of account and 
records examined by us in the normal course of audit, and 
to the best of our knowledge and belief, we report that:
(i)	
(a)	 (A)	 The Company has maintained proper 
records showing full particulars, including 
quantitative 
details 
and 
situation 
of 
property, plant and equipment, capital 
work-in-progress and relevant details of 
right-of-use assets.
	
	
(B)	 The Company has maintained proper records 
showing full particulars of intangible assets.
	
(b)	 The Company has a regular programme of 
physical verification of its property, plant and 
equipment, 
capital 
work-in-progress, 
and 
relevant details of right-of-use assets under 
which the assets are physically verified in a 
phased manner over a period of three years, 
which in our opinion, is reasonable having regard 
to the size of the Company and the nature of 
its assets. In accordance with this programme, 
certain property, plant and equipment, capital 
work-in-progress, 
and 
relevant 
details 
of 
right-of-use assets were verified during the year 
and no material discrepancies were noticed on 
such verification.

held by the Company (other than properties 
where the Company is the lessee and the lease 
agreements are duly executed in favour of the 
lessee), disclosed in Note 3 to the standalone 
financial statements, are held in the name 
of the Company.

management 
has 
conducted 
physical 
verification of inventory at reasonable intervals 
during the year, except for goods-in-transit 
and inventory lying with third parties. In our 
opinion, the coverage and procedure of such 
verification by the management is appropriate 
and no discrepancies of 10% or more in the 
aggregate for each class of inventory were 
noticed as compared to book records. In respect 
of inventory lying with third parties, these have 
substantially been confirmed by the third parties 
and in respect of goods-in-transit, these have 
been confirmed from corresponding receipt.

Independent Auditor’s Report on the internal 
financial controls with reference to the standalone 
financial statements under Clause (i) of Sub-section 
3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (‘the 
Act’)
1.	
In conjunction with our audit of the standalone 
financial statements of Safari Industries (India) 
Limited (‘the Company’) as at and for the year ended 
31 March 2024, we have audited the internal financial 
controls with reference to standalone financial 
statements of the Company as at that date.
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged 
with Governance for Internal Financial Controls
2.	
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible 
for establishing and maintaining internal financial 
controls 
based 
on 
internal 
financial 
controls 
with reference to financial statements criteria 
established 
by 
the 
Company 
considering 
the 
essential components of internal control stated in 
the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial 
Controls over Financial Reporting (the ‘Guidance 
Note’) 
issued 
by 
the 
Institute 
of 
Chartered 
Accountants of India (‘ICAI’). These responsibilities 
include the design, implementation and maintenance 
of adequate internal financial controls that were 
operating effectively for ensuring the orderly 
and efficient conduct of the Company’s business, 
including adherence to the Company’s policies, 
the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and 
detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and 
completeness of the accounting records, and the 
timely preparation of reliable financial information, 
as required under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the Internal 
Financial Controls with Reference to Standalone 
Financial Statements
3.	
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the 
Company’s internal financial controls with reference 
to standalone financial statements based on our 
audit. We conducted our audit in accordance 
with the Standards on Auditing issued by the ICAI 
prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the 
extent applicable to an audit of internal financial 
controls with reference to standalone financial 
statements, and the Guidance Note issued by the ICAI. 
Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that 
we comply with ethical requirements and plan and 
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether adequate internal financial controls 
with reference to standalone financial statements 
Annexure B to the Independent Auditor’s Report of even date to the members 
of Safari Industries (India) Limited on the standalone financial statements for 
the year ended 31 March 2024
were established and maintained and if such controls 
operated effectively in all material respects.
4.	
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain 
audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal 
financial controls with reference to standalone 
financial statements and their operating effectiveness. 
Our audit of internal financial controls with reference 
to standalone financial statements includes obtaining 
an understanding of such internal financial controls, 
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, 
and testing and evaluating the design and operating 
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed 
risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s 
judgement, including the assessment of the risks of 
material misstatement of the standalone financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error.
5.	
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our audit opinion on the Company’s internal 
financial controls with reference to standalone 
financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with 
Reference to Standalone Financial Statements
6.	
A 
company’s 
internal 
financial 
controls 
with 
reference to standalone financial statements is a 
process designed to provide reasonable assurance 
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and 
the preparation of financial statements for external 
purposes in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles. A company’s internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements 
include those policies and procedures that (1) pertain 
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable 
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions 
and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) 
provide reasonable assurance that transactions 
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of 
financial statements in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and 
expenditures of the company are being made only in 
accordance with authorisations of management and 
directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable 
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection 
of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the 
company’s assets that could have a material effect on 
the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls 
with Reference to Standalone Financial Statements
7.	
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial 
controls with reference to standalone financial 
111
ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24
STATUTORY REPORTS
STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
statements, including the possibility of collusion or 
improper management override of controls, material 
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and 
not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation 
of the internal financial controls with reference to 
standalone financial statements to future periods are 
subject to the risk that the internal financial controls 
with reference to standalone financial statements 
may become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the 
policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
8.	
In our opinion, the Company has, in all material 
respects, adequate internal financial controls with 
reference to standalone financial statements and 
such controls were operating effectively as at 
31 March 2024, based on internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements criteria 
established by the Company considering the essential 
components of internal control stated in the Guidance 
Note issued by the ICAI.

method of accounting and historical cost convention 
except for the following material items that have 
been measured at fair value as required by the 
relevant Ind AS:

All the assets and liabilities have been classified as 
current or non-current as per the Company’s normal 
operating cycle of twelve months and other criteria 
set out in Schedule III of the Act.
2.3	 Current and Non- current classification
	
All assets and liabilities have been classified as current 
or non-current as per the Company’s operating 
cycle and other criteria set out in the Schedule III 
to the Companies Act, 2013. Based on the nature 
of products and the time between the acquisition

and liabilities.
2.4	 Use of estimates and judgements
	
The 
preparation

contingent liabilities as at the date of the Standalone 
Financial Statements and the reported amounts 
119
ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24
STATUTORY REPORTS
STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 March 2024
of revenues and expenses during the reporting 
period. The recognition, measurement, classification 
or disclosure of an item or information in the 
Standalone Financial Statements is made relying on 
these estimates.
	
The estimates and judgments used in the preparation 
of 
the 
Standalone 
Financial 
Statements 
are 
continuously evaluated by the Company and are 
based on historical experience and various other 
assumptions and factors (including expectations 
of future events) that the Company believes to 
be reasonable under the existing circumstances. 
Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
Any revision to accounting estimates is recognised 
prospectively in current and future periods.
	
Rebates, discounts and sales
	
The revenue recognition policy requires estimation of 
rebates, discounts and sales returns. There are a varied 
number of rebates/ discount schemes offered which 
are primarily driven by the terms and conditions for 
each scheme including the working methodology to 
be followed and the eligibility criteria for each of the 
scheme. The estimates for rebates/ discounts need 
to be based on evaluation of eligibility criteria and 
the past trend analysis. The expected sales returns 
are estimated based on a detailed historical study 
of past trends.
	
Provision for inventory
	
The Company writes down inventories to net realisable 
value based on an estimate of the realisability of 
inventories. Write downs on inventories are recorded 
where events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that the balances may not realised. The identification 
of write-downs requires the use of estimates of 
net selling prices of the down-graded inventories. 
Where the expectation is different from the original 
estimate, such difference will impact the carrying 
value of inventories and write-downs of inventories in 
the periods in which such estimate has been changed.
	
Defined benefit obligation
	
The Company provides defined benefit employee 
retirement plans. The present value of the defined 
benefit obligations depends on a number of 
factors that are determined on an actuarial basis 
using a number of assumptions. The assumptions 
used in determining the net cost (income) for post 
employments plans include the discount rate, salary 
escalation rate, attrition rate and mortality rate. 
Any changes in these assumptions will impact the 
carrying amount of such obligations.
	
The appropriate discount rate, salary escalation rate 
are determined and attrition rate at the end of each 
year. In determining the appropriate discount rate, 
the interest rates of government bonds of maturity 
approximating the terms of the related plan liability 
are considered and attrition rate and salary escalation 
rate is determined based on the past trends adjusted 
for expected changes in rate in the future
	
Impairment of trade receivables
	
The impairment provisions for trade receivable are 
based on expected credit loss method. The judgement 
is used in making the assumptions in calculating the 
default rate required for identifying the provision 
as per the expected credit loss method at the end of 
each reporting period.
	
Useful life of property, plant and equipment and 
intangible assets
	
The useful life of the assets are determined in 
accordance with Schedule II of the Act. In cases, 
where the useful life is different from that or is not 
prescribed in Schedule II, it is based on technical 
advice, taking into account amongst other things, the 
nature of the asset, the estimated usage of the asset, 
the operating conditions of the asset, past history 
of replacement, anticipated technological changes, 
manufacturers warranties and maintenance.
	
Recognition of deferred tax assets
	
The extent to which deferred tax assets can be 
recognised is based on an assessment of the 
probability of the Company’s future taxable income 
(supported by reliable evidence) against which the 
deferred tax assets can be utilised.
	
Evaluation of indicators for impairment of assets
	
The evaluation of applicability of indicators of 
impairment of assets requires assessment of several 
external and internal factors which could result in 
deterioration of recoverable amount of the assets.
	
Contingent liabilities
	
At each balance sheet date, basis the management 
judgment, changes in facts and legal aspects, the 
Company assesses the requirement of provisions 
against 
the 
outstanding 
contingent 
liabilities. 
However, the actual future outcome may be different 
from this judgement.
	
Impairment of financial assets
	
At each balance sheet date, based on historical default 
rates observed over expected life, existing market 
conditions as well as forward looking estimates, the 
management assesses the expected credit losses on 
outstanding receivables. Further, management also 
120
ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24
Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 March 2024
considers the factors that may influence the credit 
risk of its customer base, including the default risk 
associated with industry and country in which the 
customer operates.
	
Fair value measurements
	
Management 
applies 
valuation 
techniques 
to 
determine fair value of equity shares (where active 
market quotes are not available). This involves 
developing estimates and assumptions around 
volatility, dividend yield which may affect the value 
of equity shares.
2.5	 Property, plant and equipment
	
All the items of property, plant and equipment 
are measured at historical cost less accumulated 
depreciation 
and 
impairment 
losses, 
if 
any. 
Costs include purchase price, freight, import duties, 
non-refundable purchase taxes and other expenses 
directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. 
Cost also includes borrowing costs for long-term 
construction projects if the recognition criteria is met.
	
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying 
amount or recognised as a separate asset, as 
appropriate, only when it is probable that future 
economic benefits associated with the item will 
flow to the Company and the cost of the item can 
be measured reliably. All other expenses of repairs 
and maintenance are charged to the statement of 
profit and loss during the reporting period in which 
they are incurred.
	
leasehold improvements are stated at historical 
cost less amounts amortised proportionate to 
expired lease periods.
	
Depreciation method, estimated useful lives and 
residual value:
 
Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method 
applying the useful lives as prescribed in part C of 
Schedule II of the Act or per that evaluated vide 
technical evaluations.
	
The range of estimated useful lives of property, plant 
and equipment are as under:

The management believes that the useful lives, 
as given above, best represent the period over 
which the management expects to use these assets. 
The Company reviews the useful lives and residual 
value at each reporting date.
	
Leasehold improvements are amortised over the 
period of lease or their useful life whichever is lower.
	
Depreciation on the property, plant and equipment 
added/ disposed off/ discarded during the year is 
provided on pro rata basis with reference to the 
month of addition/ disposal/ discarding. Gains and 
losses on disposals/ derecognizing the assets are 
determined by the difference between the net 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and 
recognized in the statement of profit and loss when 
the asset is derecognized.
2.6	 Intangible assets
	
Intangible assets are held on the balance sheet at 
cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment 
losses, if any. Intangible assets developed or acquired

Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 March 2024
2.7	 Impairment of non-financial assets
	
The carrying amounts of assets are reviewed at 
each Balance Sheet date. If there is any indication 
of impairment based on internal / external factors, 
an asset is tested for impairment. When the 
carrying cost of the asset exceeds its recoverable 
value, an impairment loss is charged to Statement 
of Profit and Loss in the year in which an asset is 
identified as impaired.
	
Reversal of impairment losses recognised in prior 
years is recorded when there is an indication that the 
impairment losses recognised for the assets no longer 
exist or have decreased.
2.8	 Inventories
 
Inventories include raw material, work-in-progress, 
finished goods, stock-in-trade, stores and spares, and 
packing materials. Inventories are valued at lower 
of cost and net realisable value. Cost of inventory 
comprises all costs of purchase, duties, taxes (other 
than those subsequently recoverable from tax 
authorities) and all other costs incurred in bringing 
the inventory to their present location and condition. 
Cost is determined on weighted average basis. 
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in 
the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs 
of completion and the estimated costs necessary 
to make the sale.
	
Raw material, stores and spares and packing materials 
are not written down below cost if the finished 
products, in which they will be used, are expected to 
be sold at or above cost.
 
Finished goods and work-in-progress include costs 
of direct materials, direct labour and a proportion 
of manufacturing overheads based on the normal 
operating capacity but excluding borrowing cost.
	
Obsolete, slow moving and defective inventory are 
duly provided on the basis of management estimates.
2.9	 Revenue recognition
	
Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of 
promised products to customers in an amount that 
reflects the consideration the Company expects to 
receive in exchange for those products or services. 
Revenue is measured at transaction price net 
of rebates, discounts, sales return provision and 
taxes. A receivable is recognised by the Company 
when the control is transferred as this is the case 
of point in time recognition where consideration 
is unconditional because only the passage of time 
is required. No significant element of financing is 
deemed present as the sales are made with a credit 
period of 0-90 days. The Company applies the 
revenue recognition criteria to each component of 
the revenue transaction as set out below.
	
Income from sale of goods: Revenue from products 
is recognized as and when the control of products is 
transferred to the customer. The Company considers 
its customary business practices to determine the 
transaction price. The transaction price is the amount 
of consideration to which the Company expects to 
be entitled in exchange for the products, excluding 
amounts collected on behalf of third parties (for 
example, indirect taxes)
	
Other income: Dividend income on investments 
is recognised when the right to receive dividend is 
established. Interest income is recognized on a time 
proportionate basis taking into account the amounts 
invested and the rate of interest.
	
Trade receivables: A receivable represents the 
Company’s right to an amount of consideration under 
the contract with a customer that is unconditional 
and realisable on the due date.
2.10	 Financial instruments
	
A financial instrument is any contract that gives 
rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial 
liability or equity instrument of another entity.
 
A. 
Non-derivative financial instruments:
	
1.	
Financial assets
	
(i)	
Initial recognition and measurement:
	
	
Financial assets are recognised when the 
Company becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions 
of 
the 
instruments. 
On 
initial 
recognition, a financial asset is measured at 
fair value. In case of financial assets which are 
recognised at fair value through profit or loss 
(FVTPL), their transaction costs are recognised 
in the statement of profit and loss. In other 
cases, the transaction cost are attributed to the 
acquisition value of the financial asset.
	
(ii)	 Subsequent measurement:
	
	
Financial 
assets 
are 
classified 
as 
subsequently measured at:
	
	
(a)	 Amortised cost,
	
	
(b)	 Fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”) or
122
ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24
Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 March 2024
	
	
(c)	
Fair value through other comprehensive 
income (“FVOCI”)
	
	
The 
above 
classification 
is 
being 
determined considering:
	
	
(a)	 the entity’s business model for managing 
the financial assets and
	
	
(b)	 the contractual cash flow characteristics of 
the financial asset.
	
	
Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent 
to their recognition, except if and in the period 
the Company changes its business model for 
managing the financial assets.
	
	
(a)	 Measured at amortised cost:
	
	
	
Financial assets are subsequently measured 
at amortised cost, if these financial assets 
are held within a business model whose 
objective is to hold these assets in order 
to collect contractual cash flows and the 
contractual terms of the financial asset give 
rise on specified dates to cash flows that are 
solely payments of principal and interest on 
the principal amount outstanding.
	
	
(b)	 Measured at FVOCI:
	
	
	
Financial assets are subsequently measured 
at FVOCI, if these financial assets are held 
within a business model whose objective 
is achieved by both collecting contractual 
cash flows that give rise on specified dates 
to solely payments of principal and interest 
on the principal amount outstanding and 
selling financial assets. Fair value movements 
are recognised in the other comprehensive 
income (“OCI”). Interest income measured 
using the effective interest rate (EIR) 
method and impairment losses, if any are 
recognised in the statement of profit and 
loss. On derecognition, cumulative gain 
or loss previously recognised in the OCI is 
reclassified from equity to the statement 
of profit and loss under the head ‘Other 
income’/ ‘Other expenses’.
	
	
(c)	
Measured at FVTPL:
	
	
	
Financial assets, other than investment 
in equity instruments, are subsequently 
measured 
at 
FVTPL 
unless 
they 
are 
measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI. 
Such financial assets are measured at 
fair value with all changes in fair value, 
including interest income and dividend 
income if any, recognised in the statement 
of profit and loss.
	
	
	
Investment in equity instruments:
	
	
	
On 
initial 
recognition, 
the 
Company 
can make an irrevocable election (on an 
instrument-by-instrument basis) to present 
the subsequent changes in fair value in 
OCI that would otherwise be measured at 
FVTPL pertaining to investments in equity 
instruments (other than investment in 
subsidiary). This election is not permitted 
if the equity investment is held for trading. 
These elected investments are initially 
measured at fair value plus transaction 
costs. Subsequently, they are measured at 
fair value with gains and losses arising from 
changes in fair value recognised in OCI 
and accumulated in the ‘Reserve for equity 
instruments through other comprehensive 
income’. The cumulative gain or loss is 
not reclassified to the statement of profit 
and loss on disposal of the investments. 
However, the Company may transfer the 
cumulative gain or loss within equity.
	
	
	
Dividends 
on 
these 
investments 
in 
equity instruments are recognised in the 
statement of profit and loss under the 
head ‘Other income’ when the Company’s 
right to receive the dividend is established, 
it is probable that the economic benefits 
associated with the dividend will flow to 
the entity, the dividend does not represent 
a recovery of part of cost of the investment 
and the amount of dividend can be 
measured reliably.
	
	
	
Investment in subsidiary:
	
	
	
Investment in subsidiary is carried at cost 
less accumulated impairment losses, if any. 
Where an indication of impairment exists, 
the carrying amount of the investment is 
assessed. Where the carrying amount of 
an investment is greater than its estimated 
recoverable amount, it is written down 
immediately to its recoverable amount 
and the difference is transferred to the 
statement of profit and loss. On disposal of 
investment, the difference between the net 
disposal proceeds and the carrying amount 
is charged or credited to the statement of 
profit and loss.

(iii)	 Impairment:
	
	
The Company recognises a loss allowance for 
expected credit losses (“ECL”) on financial assets 
that are measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI. 
The credit loss is the difference between all 
contractual cash flows that are due to an entity 
in accordance with the contract and all the cash 
flows that the entity expects to receive (i.e. 
all cash shortfalls), discounted at the original 
EIR. This is assessed on an individual or collective 
basis after considering all reasonable and 
supportable information including that which is 
forward-looking.
	
	
The Company’s trade receivables do not 
contain 
significant 
financing 
component 
and loss allowance on trade receivables is 
measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECL 
i.e. expected cash shortfalls, being simplified 
approach for recognition of impairment loss 
allowance. Under simplified approach, the 
Company does not track changes in credit risk. 
Rather it recognises impairment loss allowance 
based on the lifetime ECL at each reporting date 
right from its initial recognition. The Company 
uses a provision matrix to determine impairment 
loss allowance on the portfolio of trade 
receivables. The provision matrix is based on 
its historically observed default rates over 
the expected life of the trade receivable and 
is adjusted for forward-looking estimates. 
At every reporting date, the historically observed 
default rates are updated and changes in the 
forward-looking estimates are analysed.
	
	
For financial assets other than trade receivables, 
the Company recognises 12-month ECL for all 
originated or acquired financial assets if at the 
reporting date the credit risk of the financial 
asset has not increased significantly since its 
initial recognition. The ECL are measured 
as lifetime ECL if the credit risk on financial 
asset increases significantly since its initial 
recognition. If, in a subsequent period, credit 
quality of the instrument improves such that 
there is no longer significant increase in credit 
risks since initial recognition, then the Company 
reverts to recognising impairment loss allowance 
based on 12-month ECL. The impairment losses 
and reversals are recognised in the statement 
of profit and loss. For equity instruments and 
financial assets measured at FVTPL, there is no 
requirement of impairment testing.
	
(iv)	 Derecognition:
	
	
The Company derecognises a financial asset when,
	
	
(a)	 the contractual rights to the cash flows 
from the financial asset expire, or
	
	
(b)	 it transfers the contractual rights to 
receive the cash flows of the financial 
asset and has substantially transferred all 
the risks and rewards of ownership of the 
financial asset, or
	
	
(c)	
it retains the contractual rights to receive 
the cash flows of the financial asset, but 
assumes a contractual obligation to pay the 
cash flows without material delay to one 
or more recipients under a pass through 
arrangement 
(thereby 
substantially 
transferring all the risks and rewards of 
ownership of the financial asset), or
	
	
(d)	 it has neither transferred nor retained 
substantially all of the risks and rewards of 
ownership of the financial asset and does 
not retain control over the financial asset.
	
	
When the Company transfers a financial asset, it 
evaluates the extent to which it has retained the 
risks and rewards of ownership of the financial 
asset. If the Company has neither transferred nor 
retained substantially all of the risks and rewards 
of ownership of the financial asset, but retains 
control of the financial asset, the Company 
continues to recognise such financial asset to 
the extent of its continuing involvement in the 
financial asset. In that case, the Company also 
recognises an associated liability. The financial 
asset and the associated liability are measured 
on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations 
that the Company has retained.
	
2.	
Financial liabilities:
	
(i)	
Initial recognition and measurement
	
	
Financial liabilities are recognised when the 
Company becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instruments. Financial liabilities 
are initially recognised at fair value, net of 
directly attributable transaction costs for all 
financial liabilities not carried at FVTPL.
	
(ii)	 Subsequent measurement:
	
	
The 
Company 
subsequently 
measures 
all 
non-derivative financial liabilities at amortised 
cost using EIR method. A gain or loss on a 
financial liability measured at amortised cost is 
124
ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24
Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 March 2024
recognised in the statement of profit and loss 
when the financial liability is derecognised and 
through EIR amortisation process.
	
	
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into 
account any discount or premium on acquisition 
and fees or costs that are an integral part of the 
EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as finance 
costs in the statement of profit and loss.
	
(iii)	 Derecognition:
	
	
A financial liability is derecognised when the 
obligation under the liability is discharged or 
cancelled or expires. When an existing financial 
liability is replaced by another from the same 
lender on substantially different terms, or the 
terms of an existing liability are substantially 
modified, such an exchange or modification 
is treated as the derecognition of the original 
liability and the recognition of a new liability. 
The difference between the carrying amount 
of the financial liability derecognized and the 
consideration paid is recognised in the statement 
of profit and loss.
	
(iv)	 Offsetting of financial instruments:
	
	
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset 
and the net amount is reported in the balance 
sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal 
right to offset the recognised amounts and there 
is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise 
the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
	
3.	
Equity instruments:
	
	
An equity instrument is a contract that 
evidences residual interest in the assets of the 
Company after deducting all of its liabilities. 
Equity instruments issued by the Company are 
recognised at the proceeds received, net of 
direct issue costs.
	
	
Repurchase of the Company’s own equity 
instruments is recognised and deducted directly 
in equity. No gain or loss is recognised in the 
statement of profit and loss on the purchase, 
sale, issue or cancellation of the Company’s own 
equity instruments. Dividends paid on equity 
instruments are directly reduced from equity.
	
4.	
Compound financial instruments:
	
	
The component parts of compound instruments 
(convertible debentures) issued by the Company 
are classified separately as financial liabilities and 
equity in accordance with the substance of the 
contractual arrangements and the definitions of 
a financial liability and an equity instrument.
	
	
At the date of issue, the fair value of the liability 
component is estimated using the prevailing 
market interest rates. This amount is recorded as 
a liability on an amortised cost basis using the 
effective interest method until extinguished upon 
conversion or at the instrument’s maturity date.
	
	
The conversion option classified as equity is 
determined by deducting the amount of the 
liability component from the fair value of 
the compound instrument as a whole. This is 
recognised and included in equity, net of income 
tax effects, and is not subsequently remeasured. 
In addition, the conversion option classified as 
equity will remain in equity until the conversion 
option is exercised, in which case, the balance 
recognised in equity will be transferred to other 
component of equity.
	
	
Transaction costs that relate to the issue of 
the 
convertible 
instruments 
are 
allocated 
to the liability and equity components in 
proportion to the allocation of the gross 
proceeds. Transaction costs relating to the 
equity component are recognised directly in 
equity. Transaction costs relating to the liability 
component are included in the carrying amount 
of the liability component and are amortised 
over the lives of the convertible instrument 
using the effective interest method.
	
B.	
Derivative financial instruments:
	
	
The 
Company 
uses 
derivative 
financial 
instruments, such as forward foreign exchange 
contracts, to hedge its foreign currency risks. 
Such derivative financial instruments are initially 
recognised at fair value on the date on which 
a derivative contract is entered into and are 
subsequently remeasured at fair value, with 
changes in fair value recognised in the statement 
of profit and loss.
2.11	 Fair value measurement
	
The Company measures financial instruments such as, 
derivatives at fair value at each balance sheet date. 
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell 
an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly 
transaction between market participants at the 
measurement date. The fair value measurement is 
based on the presumption that the transaction to sell 
the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:

• 
in the principal market for the asset or liability, or
 
• 
in the absence of a principal market, in the most 
advantageous market for the asset or liability 
The principal or the most advantageous market 
must be accessible by the Company.
	
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured 
using the assumptions that market participants would 
use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that 
market participants act in their best economic interest.
 
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset 
takes into account a market participant’s ability to 
generate economic benefits by using the asset in its 
highest and best use or by selling it to another market 
participant that would use the asset in its highest and 
best use. The Company uses valuation techniques that 
are appropriate in the circumstances and for which 
sufficient data are available to measure fair value, 
maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and 
minimising the use of unobservable inputs. All assets 
and liabilities for which fair value is measured or 
disclosed in the Standalone Financial Statements are 
categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described 
as follows, based on the lowest level input that is 
significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:
 
Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets 
for identical assets or liabilities.
	
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included 
within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or 
liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. 
derived from prices).
	
Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based 
on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
	
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the 
Standalone Financial Statements on a recurring 
basis, the Company determines whether transfers 
have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by 
re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level 
input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
as a whole) at the end of each reporting period. 
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Company 
has determined classes of assets and liabilities on 
the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of 
the asset or liability and the level of the fair value 
hierarchy as explained above.
2.12	Foreign currency transactions
	
The Company’s Standalone Financial Statements are 
presented in INR which is also its functional currency.
	
a)	
Initial recognition:
	
	
Transactions in foreign currency are recorded 
at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of 
the transaction. Exchange differences arising on 
foreign exchange transactions settled during the 
year are recognised in the statement of profit 
and loss for the year.
	
b)	
Measurement of foreign currency items at the 
balance sheet date:
	
	
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currency remaining unsettled at the end 
of the year, are translated at the closing exchange 
rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
	
	
Exchange differences arising on settlement or 
translation of monetary items are recognised in 
the statement of profit and loss.
 
 
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that 
are denominated in foreign currencies are 
retranslated at the rates prevailing at the 
date when the fair value was determined. 
Non-monetary items that are measured in 
terms of historical cost in a foreign currency 
are not retranslated. The gain or loss arising on 
translation of non-monetary items measured at 
fair value is treated in line with the recognition 
of the gain or loss on the change in fair value 
of the item (i.e. translation differences on items 
whose fair value gain or loss is recognised in the 
OCI or the statement of profit and loss are also 
reclassified in the OCI or the statement of profit 
and loss, respectively).
2.13	Taxes on income
	
Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. 
Income tax expense is recognised in the statement of 
profit and loss except to the extent it relates to items 
directly recognised in equity or in OCI.
	
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year. 
Taxable profit is different from accounting profit due 
to temporary difference between accounting and tax 
treatments, and due to items that are never taxable or 
tax deductible. Tax provisions are included in current 
liabilities. Interest and penalties on tax liabilities 
are provided for in the tax charge. The Company 
offsets, the current tax assets and liabilities (on a 
year-on-year basis) where it has a legally enforceable 
right and where it intends to settle such assets and 
liabilities on a net basis or to realise the assets and 
liabilities on net basis.
126
ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24
Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 March 2024
	
Deferred income tax is recognised using the balance 
sheet approach. Deferred income tax assets and 
liabilities are recognised for deductible and taxable 
temporary differences arising between the tax base 
of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount in 
Standalone Financial Statements. Deferred income 
tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that taxable profit will be available against 
which the deductible temporary differences, and 
the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused 
tax losses can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are not 
recognised when it is more likely than not that the 
assets will not be realised in the future.
	
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets 
is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to 
the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient 
taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of 
the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
	
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are 
measured at the tax rates that are expected to 
apply in the period when the asset is realised or the 
liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
reporting date.
	
Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation 
to the underlying transaction either in OCI or 
directly in equity.
	
While determining the tax provisions, the Company 
assesses whether each uncertain tax position is to be 
considered separately or together with one or more 
uncertain tax positions depending upon the nature 
and circumstances of each uncertain tax position.
2.14	Employee benefits
 
The Company has following post-employment plans:
	
(a)	 Defined 
contribution 
plan 
such 
as 
Provident fund and
 
(b) Defined benefit plan- Gratuity
	
(c)	
Compensated Absences
	
a)	
Defined contribution plan
	
	
Under defined contribution plan, the Company 
pays pre-defined amounts to separate funds and 
does not have any legal or informal obligation 
to pay additional sums. Defined Contribution 
plan comprise of contributions to the employees’ 
provident fund with the government and certain 
state plans like employees’ state insurance and 
employees’ pension scheme. The Company’s 
payments to the defined contribution plans are 
recognised as expenses during the period in 
which the employees perform the services that 
the payment covers.
	
b)	
Defined benefit plan:
	
	
The liability or asset recognised in the balance 
sheet in respect of defined benefit gratuity 
plan is the present value of defined benefit 
obligations at the end of the reporting period 
less fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit 
obligations is calculated annually by actuary 
through actuarial valuation using the projected 
unit credit method.
	
	
The Company recognises the following changes 
in the net defined benefit obligation as an 
expense in the statement of profit and loss:
	
	
(i)	
Service costs comprising current service 
costs, 
past 
service 
costs, 
gains 
and 
losses on curtailment and non-routine 
settlements; and
	
	
(ii)	 Net interest expense or income
	
	
The net interest cost is calculated by applying 
the discount rate to the net balance of the 
defined benefit obligation and fair value of plan 
assets. This cost is included in ‘Employee benefits 
expense’ in the statement of profit and loss.
	
	
Remeasurements of the net defined benefit 
liability/ (asset) comprising:
	
	
(i)	
actuarial (gains)/ losses,
	
	
(ii)	 return on plan assets, excluding amounts 
included in interest income and
	
	
(iii)	 any change in the effect of the asset ceiling, 
excluding amounts included in interest 
income are recognised in the period in which 
they occur directly in OCI. Remeasurements 
are not reclassified to the statement of 
profit and loss in subsequent periods.
	
	
Ind AS 19 “Employee benefits” requires the 
exercise of judgment in relation to various 
assumptions including future pay rises, inflation, 
discount rates and employee demographics. 
The Company determines the assumptions in 
conjunction with its actuaries, and believes 
these assumptions to be in line with best 
practice, but the application of different 
assumptions could have a significant effect on 
127
ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24
STATUTORY REPORTS
STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 March 2024
the amounts reflected in the statement of profit 
and loss, OCI and balance sheet. There may 
also be interdependency between some of 
the assumptions.
	
c)	
Compensated absences
	
	
The Company had a policy on compensated 
absences which were both accumulating and 
non accumulating in nature. In the previous 
year, the Company had revised it policy 
for compensated absences to allow leave 
entitlements which would be non-accumulating 
in nature except for a certain class of employees. 
Expense on non-accumulating compensated 
absences is recognised in the period in which 
the absences occur. Necessary impact of the 
same had been considered in the Standalone 
Financial Statements.
	
	
The Company presents the entire leave as a 
current liability in the Balance Sheet, since 
it does not have any unconditional right to 
defer its settlement for twelve months after 
the reporting date
2.15	Share-based payments
 
Equity-settled share-based payments to employees 
are measured at the fair value of the equity 
instruments at the grant date using an appropriate 
valuation model.
	
The fair value determined at the grant date of the 
equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on 
a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on 
the Company’s estimate of equity instruments that 
will eventually vest, with a corresponding increase 
in equity. At the end of each reporting period, the 
Company revises its estimate of the number of equity 
instruments expected to vest. The impact of the 
revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised 
in the statement of profit and loss such that the 
cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with 
a corresponding adjustment to the equity-settled 
share-based payment reserve.
	
No expense is recognised for ESOPs that do not 
ultimately vest because non-market performance 
and/ or service conditions have not been met.
	
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected 
as additional share dilution in the computation of 
diluted earnings per share.
2.16	Leases
	
The Company’s lease asset classes primarily consist of 
leases for buildings. The Company assesses whether 
a contract is, or contains, a lease, at inception of 
a contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the 
contract conveys the right to control the use of an 
identified asset for a period of time in exchange for 
consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys 
the right to control the use of an identified asset, the 
Company assesses whether:
	
(i)	
the contract involves the use of an identified asset,
	
(ii)	 the 
Company 
has 
the 
right 
to 
obtain 
substantially all of the economic benefits from 
use of the identified asset, throughout the 
period of use, and
	
(iii)	 the Company has the right to direct the use of the 
identified asset, throughout the period of use.
	
At the date of commencement of the lease, the 
Company recognises a right-of-use asset and a 
corresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements 
in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of 
twelve months or less (short-term leases) and leases 
of low value assets. For these short-term leases and 
leases of low value assets, the Company recognises 
the lease payments as an operating expense on a 
straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
 
The right-of-use assets are initially recognised at 
cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease 
liability. They are subsequently measured at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, 
if any. Right-of-use assets are depreciated from the 
commencement date on a straight-line basis over 
the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the 
underlying asset.
	
The lease liability is initially measured at the present 
value of the future lease payments. The lease 
payments are discounted using the interest rate 
implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, 
using the incremental borrowing rates. The lease 
liability is subsequently remeasured by increasing 
the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease 
liability and reducing the carrying amount to reflect 
the lease payments made.
	
A lease liability is remeasured upon the occurrence of 
certain events such as a change in the lease term or 
a change in an index or rate used to determine lease 
payments. The remeasurement normally also adjusts 
the leased assets. Lease liabilities and right-of-use 
assets have been separately presented in the balance 
sheet and lease payments have been classified as 
financing cash flows.
128
ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24
Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 March 2024
2.17	Provisions and contingencies
	
A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, 
the Company has a present legal or constructive 
obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is 
probable that an outflow of economic benefits will 
be required to settle the obligation. Provisions for 
onerous contracts are recognised when the expected 
benefits to be derived by the Company from a 
contract are lower than the unavoidable costs of 
meeting the future obligations under the contract.
	
A disclosure for contingent liabilities is made where 
there is a possible obligation or a present obligation 
that may probably not require an outflow of resources 
or an obligation for which the future outcome cannot 
be ascertained with reasonable certainty. When there 
is a possible or a present obligation where the 
likelihood of outflow of resources is remote, no 
provision or disclosure is made.
2.18	Cash and cash equivalents
	
Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet and 
for the purpose of statement of cash flows include 
cash and cheques in hand, bank balances, demand 
deposits with banks and other short-term highly 
liquid investments that are readily convertible to 
known amounts of cash and which are subject to an 
insignificant risk of changes in value where original 
maturity is three months or less.
2.19	Earnings per equity share
	
Basic earnings per equity share are calculated 
by dividing the net profit/ (loss) for the period 
attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted 
average number of equity shares outstanding during 
the period. Earnings considered in ascertaining the 
Company’s earnings per equity share is the net profit/ 
(loss) for the period. The weighted average number 
of equity shares outstanding during the period and 
for all periods presented is adjusted for events, such 
as bonus shares, share split, etc. that have changed 
the number of equity shares outstanding, without a 
corresponding change in resources.
	
For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings 
per share, the net profit/ (loss) for the period 
attributable to equity shareholders and the weighted 
average number of shares outstanding during 
the period is adjusted for the effects of all dilutive 
potential equity shares.
2.20	Segment reporting
	
As the Company business activity primarily falls 
within a single business luggage and luggage 
accessory and geographical segment (domestic) 
and the Chief Operating Decision Maker monitors 
the operating results of its business units not 
separately for the purpose of making decisions about 
resource allocation and performance assessment. 
Segment performance is evaluated based on profit or 
loss and is measured consistently with profit or loss in 
the Standalone Financial Statements, thus there are 
no additional disclosure to be provided under Ind As 
108 – Segment Reporting.
2.21	Borrowing costs
	
General and specific borrowing costs that are 
directly attributable to the acquisition, construction 
or production of qualifying assets are capitalised as 
a part of cost of those assets during the period till 
all the activities necessary to prepare the qualifying 
assets for their intended use or sale are complete. 
Qualifying assets are assets that necessarily take 
a substantial period of time to get ready for their 
intended use or sale.
	
All other borrowing costs are recognised as an 
expense in the period in which they are incurred.
2.22	Exceptional items
	
When an item of income or expense within profit/ 
(loss) from ordinary activity is of such size, nature or 
incidence that their disclosure is relevant to explain 
the performance of the Company for the year, 
the nature and amount of such items is disclosed 
separately in the statement of profit and loss.
2.23	Recent accounting pronouncements
	
The Ministry of Corporate Affairs has notified 
Companies 
(Indian 
Accounting 
Standards) 
Amendment Rules, 2023 dated 31 March 2023 to 
amend the following ind AS which are effective for 
annual periods beginning on or after 1 April 2023. 
	
The 
Company 
applied 
for 
the 
first 
time 
these amendments.
	
(i)	
Definition of Accounting Estimates-Amendments 
to Ind AS 8
	
	
The amendments clarify the distinction between 
changes in accounting estimates and changes 
in accounting policies and the correction of 
errors. It has also been clarified how entities 
use measurement techniques and inputs to 
develop accounting estimates. The amendments 
had no impact on the Company’s standalone 
financial statements.
129
ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24
STATUTORY REPORTS
STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
	
(ii)	 Disclosure of Accounting Policies-Amendments 
to Ind AS 1
	
	
The amendments aim to help entities provide 
accounting policy disclosures that are more 
useful by replacing the requirement for entities 
to disclose their ‘significant’ accounting policies 
with a requirement to disclose their ‘Material 
accounting policy information and adding 
guidance on how entitles apply the concept of 
materiality in making decisions about accounting 
policy disclosures. The amendments have had 
an impact on the Company’s disclosures of 
accounting policies, but not on the measurement, 
recognition or presentation of any items in the 
Company’s financial statements.
	
(iii)	 Deferred 
Tax 
related 
to 
Assets 
and 
Liabilities 
arising 
from 
a 
Single 
Transaction-Amendments to Ind AS 12
	
	
The amendments narrow the scope of the initial 
recognition exception under Ind AS 12, so that 
it no longer applies to transactions that give 
rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary 
differences such has leases. The Company 
previously recognised for deferred tax on leases 
on a net basis. As a result of these amendments, 
the Company has recognised a separate deferred 
tax asset in relation to its lease liabilities and a 
deferred tax liability in relation to its right-of-
use assets. Since, these balances qualify for 
offset as per the requirements of paragraph 74 
of Ind AS 12, there is no impact in the balance 
sheet. There was also no impact on the opening 
retained earnings as at 1 April 2022. Apart from 
these, consequential amendments and editorials 
have been made to other Ind AS like Ind AS 101, 
Ind AS 102, Ind AS 103, Ind AS 107, Ind AS 109, 
Ind AS 115 and Ind AS 34

Extension and termination option
Extension and termination options are included in a number of leases across the Company. These are used to maximise 
operational flexibility in terms of managing the assets used in the Company’s operations. The majority of extension and 
termination options held are excersiable when mutually agreed between the lessor and the Company.
Variable lease payments
Some property leases contain variable payment terms that are linked to sales generated from a store. Variable payment 
terms are used for a variety of reasons, including minimising the fixed costs base for newly established stores. Variable lease 
payments that depend on sales are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which the condition that triggers those 
payments occurs.

These assumptions were developed by the management with the assistance of independent actuarial appraisers. 
Discount factors are determined close to each year end by reference to government bonds of relevant 
economic markets and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related obligation. 
Other assumptions are based on management’s historical experience. The estimate of future salary increase 
considered in actuarial valuation take account of inflation, seniority, promotion and other relevant factors such 
as supply and demand in the employment market.

vii)	 Sensitivity analysis
	
	
The financial statements are sensitive to the actuarial assumptions. The changes to the defined benefit

below. The following table summarises the effects of changes in these actuarial assumptions on the defined 
benefit obligation at year-end.

The sensitivity analysis have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective 
assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions constant.
	
	
The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the projected benefit 
obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of 
the assumptions may be correlated.
	
	
Furthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the projected benefit obligation 
has been calculated using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which is the 
same method as applied in calculating the projected benefit obligation as recognised in the balance sheet.
	
	
There was no change in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis from prior years.
	
viii)	 Risks associated with defined benefit plan:
	
	
Gratuity is a defined benefit plan and entity is exposed to the following risks:
Interest rate risk
A fall in the discount rate which is linked to the Government Securities. rate will 
increase the present value of the liability requiring higher provision. A fall in the 
discount rate generally increases the mark to market value of the assets depending 
on the duration of asset.
Salary risk
The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the 
future salaries of members. As such, an increase in the salary of the members more 
than assumed level will increase the plan’s liability.
Investment risk
The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount 
rate which is determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting 
period on government bonds. If the return on plan asset is below this rate, it will 
create a plan deficit.
Asset Liability 
Matching (‘ALM’) risk
The plan faces the ALM risk as to the matching cash flow. Since the plan is invested in 
lines of Rule 101 of Income Tax Rules, 1962, this generally reduces ALM risk.
Mortality risk
Since the benefits under the plan is not payable for life time and payable till retirement 
age only, plan does not have any longevity risk. Mortality rate during employment is 
calculated considering Indian Assured Lives Mortality 2012-14 (Urban) (Previous year: 
Indian Assured Lives Mortality 2012-14 (Urban))
Concentration risk 
Plan is having a concentration risk as all the assets are invested with the insurance 
company and a default will wipe out all the assets. Although probability of this is very 
less as insurance companies have to follow regulatory guidelines which mitigate risk.

i)	
Fair value hierarchy
	
The Company uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by 
valuation technique:
 
Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
	
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either 
directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
	
Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
	
The carrying amounts and fair values of financial instruments by category are as follows:

Valuation techniques used to determine fair value
	
The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities are included at the amount that would be received to sell an asset 
and paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. The following methods were 
used to estimate the fair values:
 
- 
Other non-current financial assets and liabilities : the carrying value is considered to be approximate to 
their fair value.
 
- 
Derivative financial assets and liabilities: The Company enters into derivative contracts with various 
counterparties, principally financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. Forward foreign currency 
contracts are determined using forward exchange rates at the reporting date.
 
- 
Current investments-The fair values of investments in mutual fund units is based on the net asset value (‘NAV’) 
as stated by the issuers of these mutual fund units in the published statements as at Balance Sheet date. 
NAV represents the price at which the issuer will issue further units of mutual fund and the price at which 
issuers will redeem such units from the investors.

Trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents, other bank balances, loans, other current financial assets, 
trade payables and other current financial liabilities: Approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the 
short-term maturities of these instruments.
 
- 
Borrowings taken by the Company are as per the Company’s credit and liquidity risk assessment and there is no 
comparable instrument having the similar terms and conditions with related security being pledged and hence 
the carrying value of the borrowings represents the best estimate of its fair value.
	
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the standalone financial statements on a recurring basis, the 
Company determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation 
(based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each 
reporting period.

Financial risk management
	
The Company’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company’s 
primary focus is to foresee the unpredictability of financial markets and seek to minimise potential adverse effects on 
its financial performance. The primary market risk to the Company is foreign exchange risk. The Board of Directors 
reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below:

Market risk
(a)	 Interest rate risk
	
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of the financial instruments will fluctuate because 
of changes in market interest rates.  The Company is mainly exposed to this risk due to borrowings having variable 
rate of interest.

Interest rate sensitivity
	
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates on that portion 
of borrowings affected. With all other variables held constant, the Company’s profit or loss before tax is affected 
through the impact on floating rate borrowings, as follows:
Particulars
Impact on profit or loss and 
total equity

Floating rate instruments:
50 basis points increase
 (0.05)
 (0.12)
50 basis points decrease
 0.05 
 0.12 
	
Hence, the Company is not significantly exposed to the interest rate risk as working capital facilities are, as per 
contractual terms, primarily of short term in nature.
(b)	 Foreign currency risk 
	
Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of 
changes in foreign exchange rates. The Company’s foreign exchange risk arises from its trade payables and trade 
receivables denominated in foreign currencies. The results of the Company’s operations can be affected as the 
Indian Rupees (‘INR’) is volatile against these currencies. The Company enters into derivative financial instruments 
164

Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements

(All amounts in ` crores, unless otherwise stated)
such as foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency 
exposures and also  inherent hedging as it is engaged in the export of manufacturing products. The Company has a 
treasury team which monitors the foreign exchange fluctuations on a continuous basis and advises the management 
of any material adverse effect on the Company.

Credit risk 
	
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails 
to meet its contractual obligations, and arises from cash and cash equivalents, bank balances other than cash and

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
cash equivalents, other financial assets as well as credit exposures to customers including outstanding receivables. 
The maximum exposure to credit risk is equal to the carrying value of the financial assets.
	
The objective of managing counterparty credit risk is to prevent losses in financial assets. The Company assesses the 
credit quality of the counterparties, taking into account their financial position, past experience and other factors. 
The Company establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its expected credit losses in respect of trade 
and other receivables. The management uses a simplified approach for the purpose of computation of allowance 
for expected credit loss for trade receivables( refer note 14).
	
The Company’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. 
The demographics of the customer, including the default risk of the industry and country, in which the customer 
operates, also has an influence on credit risk assessment. Credit risk is managed through credit approvals, establishing 
credit limits, continuously monitoring the credit worthiness of customers.
	
In respect of trade receivables, the Company is not exposed to any significant credit risk exposure to any single 
counterparty or any company of counterparties having similar characteristics. Trade receivables consist of a large 
number of customers in various geographical areas. The Company has very limited history of customer default, and 
considers the credit quality of trade receivables for evaluation of allowance for expected credit loss.
	
The credit risk on liquid funds such as balance in current and deposit accounts with banks and derivative financial 
instruments (included in other financial assets) is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings.

Liquidity risk
	
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they become due. 
The Company manages its liquidity risk by ensuring, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to 
meet its liabilities when due. 
	
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has established an 
appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Company’s short-term, medium-term 
and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements. The  Company manages liquidity risk by maintaining 
adequate  reserves, banking facilities and committed borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and 
actual cash flows, and by matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities and by monitoring rolling 
166

forecasts of its liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs while maintaining 
sufficient headroom on its undrawn committed borrowing facilities at all times so that the Company does not 
breach borrowing limits or covenants (where applicable) on any of its borrowing facilities.

information about operating segments and related disclosures about revenue, geographic areas and major 
customers.The Company’s Chairman and Managing Director has been identified as the Chief Operating Decision 
Maker (‘CODM’) as defined under Ind AS 108 “Operating Segments”. As the Company business activity primarily 
falls within a single business and geographical segment and the Chief Operating Decision Maker monitors the 
operating results of its business units not separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation 
and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on profit or loss and is measured consistently 
with profit or loss in the standalone financial statements, thus there are no additional disclosures to be provided 
under Ind AS 108 –“Segment Reporting” apart from the one mentioned in note 41(c).

To the Members of Safari Industries (India) Limited
Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements
Opinion
1.	
We have audited the accompanying consolidated 
financial statements of Safari Industries (India) 
Limited (‘the Holding Company’) and its subsidiaries 
(the Holding Company and its subsidiaries together 
referred to as ‘the Group’), as listed in Annexure 
1, which comprise the Consolidated Balance Sheet 
as at 31 March 2024, the Consolidated Statement 
of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive 
Income), the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement and 
the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity for 
the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated 
financial statements, including a material accounting 
policy information and other explanatory information.
2.	
In our opinion and to the best of our information 
and according to the explanations given to us, the 
aforesaid consolidated financial statements give 
the information required by the Companies Act, 
2013 (‘the Act’) in the manner so required and give 
a true and fair view in conformity with the Indian 
Accounting Standards (‘Ind AS’) specified under 
section 133 of the Act, read with the Companies 
(Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, and other 
accounting principles generally accepted in India of 
the consolidated state of affairs of the Group, as at 
31 March 2024, and their consolidated profit (including 
Independent Auditor’s Report
other comprehensive income), consolidated cash 
flows and the consolidated changes in equity for the 
year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
3.	
We conducted our audit in accordance with the 
Standards on Auditing specified under section 
143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those 
standards are further described in the Auditor’s 
Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements section of our report. We are 
independent of the Group, in accordance with the 
Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India (‘ICAI’) together with the 
ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit 
of the consolidated financial statements under the 
provisions of the Act and the rules thereunder, and 
we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in 
accordance with these requirements and the Code of 
Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our opinion.
Key Audit Matter
4.	
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our 
professional judgment, were of most significance in 
our audit of the consolidated financial statements of 
the current period. These matters were addressed in 
the context of our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion 
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion 
on these matters.
5.	
We have determined the matter described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.
Key audit matter
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Revenue Recognition under Ind AS 115, Revenue 
from Contracts with Customers (‘Ind AS 115’)
Refer note 2.10 – ‘Revenue recognition’ and note 
25 and 41 – ‘Revenue from operations’ to the 
consolidated financial statements for the related 
accounting policy on revenue recognition and details 
of revenue recognised during the year.
Revenue for the Holding Company consists primarily 
of sale of manufactured and traded goods. Owing to 
the multiplicity of the Holding Company’s channels 
through which sale of products is made, and diverse 
terms of contracts with customers, revenue is 
determined to be an area involving significant risk 
and hence, requiring significant auditor attention. 
Our audit included, but was not limited to, the following 
procedures performed in respect of revenue recognition:
• 
Understood the process of revenue recognition and 
evaluated the appropriateness of the accounting 
policy adopted by the management on revenue 
recognition in accordance with Ind AS 115.
• 
Evaluated the design and tested the operating 
effectiveness of manual and information technology 
internal financial controls, including controls over 
identification of the distinct performance obligations, 
determination of transaction price and satisfaction 
of performance obligations. Procedures performed 
included enquiry, observation and inspection of 
evidence in respect of operation of these controls.
176
ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24
Key audit matter
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Further, the application of Ind AS 115 involves 
significant judgements / material estimates relating 
to 
identification 
of 
performance 
obligations, 
determination of transaction price, including impact 
of variable consideration in the form of rebates and 
discounts, assessment of satisfaction of the identified 
performance obligations represented by the transfer 
of control of the products sold.
Revenue is a key performance indicator and 
there is presumed fraud risk of revenue being 
overstated during the year on account of variation 
in the timing of transfer of control due pressure 
to achieve performance targets and meeting the 
external expectations.
Owing to significance of amount, multiplicity of the 
Holding Company’s channels through which sale of 
products is made, volume of transactions, nature of 
customer with varied terms of contracts, presumed 
fraud risk, audit of revenue recognized during the 
year requires significant auditor attention and 
accordingly, revenue recognition is considered to be 
a key audit matter for the current year audit.
• 
Selected channel-wise (e-commerce, hyper, trade, 
Central Police Canteen, Canteen Stores Department 
and other small channels) samples of customers, and 
performed the following procedures:
	
1.	
Read, analysed and identified the distinct 
performance obligations in these contracts;
	
2.	
Compared 
such 
performance 
obligations 
with those identified and recorded by the 
management; and
	
3.	
Reviewed 
contract 
terms 
to 
determine 
the 
transaction 
price 
including 
variable 
consideration, 
if 
any, 
to 
determine 
the 
appropriate 
transaction 
price 
for 
measuring revenue.
• 
Tested, on a sample basis, revenue transactions 
recorded during the year, and in the period 
before and after year-end, relating to sale of 
products by inspecting supporting documents 
such as customer contracts, sales orders, proofs of 
dispatch, customer acceptance, invoices, etc., for the 
accuracy and completeness of revenue recorded for 
such transactions.
• 
Assessed the underlying assumptions used by 
the management for determination of variable 
consideration as at year end, as a result of rebates, 
discount rates, sales returns, etc., and traced inputs 
used to source data.
• 
Tested a sample of credit notes issued during the 
year and subsequent to year end to confirm revenue 
recognised during the period was appropriate.
• 
Performed analytical procedures for reasonableness 
of revenue recorded such as trend analysis by 
channel, by customer, etc.
• 
Assessed 
the 
appropriateness 
and 
adequacy 
of 
disclosures 
included 
in 
the 
consolidated 
financial statements, in accordance with the 
requirements of Ind AS 115.
Information other than the Consolidated Financial 
Statements and Auditor’s Report thereon
6.	
The Holding Company’s Board of Directors are 
responsible for the other information. The other 
information comprises the information included in 
the Management Discussion and Analysis Report, 
Report on Corporate Governance, Directors’ Report, 
etc., but does not include the consolidated financial 
statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
	
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements 
does not cover the other information and we do not 
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
	
In connection with our audit of the consolidated 
financial statements, our responsibility is to read the 
other information and, in doing so, consider whether 
the other information is materially inconsistent 
with the consolidated financial statements or our 
knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise 
appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the 
work we have performed, we conclude that there is a 
material misstatement of this other information, we 
are required to report that fact. We have nothing to 
report in this regard.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged 
with Governance for the Consolidated Financial 
Statements
7.	
The accompanying consolidated financial statements 
have been approved by the Holding Company’s 
Board of Directors. The Holding Company’s Board 
of Directors are responsible for the matters stated 
in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the 
preparation and presentation of these consolidated 
financial statements that give a true and fair view 
of the consolidated financial position, consolidated 
financial performance including other comprehensive 
income, 
consolidated 
changes 
in 
equity 
and 
consolidated cash flows of the Group in accordance 
with the Ind AS specified under section 133 of the 
Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting 
Standards) Rules, 2015, and other accounting 
principles generally accepted in India. The respective 
Board of Directors of the companies included in the 
Group are responsible for maintenance of adequate 
accounting records in accordance with the provisions 
of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the 
Group and for preventing and detecting frauds and 
other irregularities; selection and application of 
appropriate accounting policies; making judgments 
and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
and design, implementation and maintenance of 
adequate internal financial controls, that were 
operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and 
completeness of the accounting records, relevant to 
the preparation and presentation of the financial 
statements that give a true and fair view and are 
free from material misstatement, whether due 
to fraud or error, which have been used for the 
purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial 
statements by the Board of Directors of the Holding 
Company, as aforesaid.
8.	
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, 
the respective Board of Directors of the companies 
included in the Group are responsible for assessing 
the ability of the Group to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related 
to going concern and using the going concern basis 
of accounting unless the Board of Directors either 
intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, 
or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
9.	
Those respective Board of Directors are also 
responsible for overseeing the financial reporting 
process of the companies included in the Group.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements
10.	 Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the consolidated financial statements as a 
whole are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report 
that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is 
a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that 
an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on 
Auditing will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or 
error and are considered material if, individually or 
in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected 
to influence the economic decisions of users taken on 
the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
11.	 As part of an audit in accordance with Standards on 
Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Act 
we exercise professional judgment and maintain 
professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
 
• 
Identify and assess the risks of material 
misstatement of the consolidated financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error, 
design and perform audit procedures responsive 
to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a 
material misstatement resulting from fraud 
is higher than for one resulting from error, as 
fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of 
internal control;
 
• 
Obtain an understanding of internal control 
relevant to the audit in order to design 
audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the 
Act we are also responsible for expressing our 
opinion on whether the Holding Company 
has adequate internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements in place and 
the operating effectiveness of such controls.;
 
• 
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting 
policies 
used 
and 
the 
reasonableness 
of 
accounting estimates and related disclosures 
made by management;
 
• 
Conclude on the appropriateness of Board of 
Directors’ use of the going concern basis of 
accounting and, based on the audit evidence 
obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists 
related to events or conditions that may cast 
significant doubt on the ability of the Group to 
continue as a going concern. If we conclude that 
a material uncertainty exists, we are required 
to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the 
related disclosures in the financial statements 
or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify 
our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the 
audit evidence obtained up to the date of our 
auditor’s report. However, future events or 
conditions may cause the Group to cease to 
continue as a going concern;
 
• 
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and 
content of the financial statements, including the 
178
ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24
disclosures, and whether the financial statements 
represent the underlying transactions and events 
in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and
 
• 
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence 
regarding the financial information of the 
entities or business activities within the Group, to 
express an opinion on the consolidated financial 
statements. We are responsible for the direction, 
supervision and performance of the audit of 
financial statements of such entities included in 
the financial statements, of which we are the 
independent auditors.
12.	 We 
communicate 
with 
those 
charged 
with 
governance regarding, among other matters, the 
planned scope and timing of the audit and significant 
audit findings, including any significant deficiencies 
in internal control that we identify during our audit.
13.	 We also provide those charged with governance with 
a statement that we have complied with relevant 
ethical requirements regarding independence, and 
to communicate with them all relationships and 
other matters that may reasonably be thought to 
bear on our independence, and where applicable, 
related safeguards.
14.	 From the matters communicated with those charged 
with governance, we determine those matters that 
were of most significance in the audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and are therefore 
the key audit matters. We describe these matters 
in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation 
precludes public disclosure about the matter or 
when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine 
that a matter should not be communicated in our 
report because the adverse consequences of doing 
so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the 
public interest benefits of such communication.
Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements
15.	 As required by section 197(16) of the Act based on 
our audit, we report that the Holding Company, 
whose financial statements have been audited under 
the Act have paid remuneration to their respective

remuneration during the year. Accordingly, reporting 
under section 197(16) of the Act is not applicable in 
respect of such subsidiaries.

Annexure II
Independent Auditor’s Report on the internal 
financial controls with reference to financial 
statements under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of 
Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (‘the Act’)
1.	
In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated 
financial statements of Safari Industries (India) 
Limited (‘the Holding Company’) and its subsidiaries 
(the Holding Company and its subsidiaries together 
referred to as ‘the Group’), as at and for the year 
ended 31 March 2024, we have audited the internal 
financial 
controls 
with 
reference 
to 
financial 
statements of the Holding Company and its subsidiary 
companies, which are companies covered under the 
Act, as at that date.
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged 
with Governance for Internal Financial Controls
2.	
The respective Board of Directors of the Holding 
Company and its subsidiary companies, which are 
companies covered under the Act, are responsible 
for establishing and maintaining internal financial 
controls based on the internal financial control with 
reference to financial statement criteria established 
by the respective companies considering the essential 
components of internal control stated in the 
Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls 
over Financial Reporting (‘the Guidance Note’) 
issued by the institute of Chartered Accountants 
of India (‘the ICAI’). These responsibilities include 
the design, implementation and maintenance of 
adequate internal financial controls that were 
operating effectively for ensuring the orderly 
and efficient conduct of the company’s business, 
including adherence to the company’s policies, 
the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and 
detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and 
completeness of the accounting records, and the 
timely preparation of reliable financial information, 
as required under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the Internal 
Financial Controls with Reference to Financial 
Statements
3.	
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on 
the internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements of the Holding Company and 
its subsidiary companies, as aforesaid, based on our 
audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the 
Standards on Auditing issued by the ICAI prescribed 
under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent 
applicable to an audit of internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements, and the 
Guidance Note issued by the ICAI. Those Standards 
and the Guidance Note require that we comply with 
ethical requirements and plan and perform the 
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
adequate internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements were established and 
maintained and if such controls operated effectively 
in all material respects.
4.	
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain 
audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal 
financial 
controls 
with 
reference 
to 
financial 
statements 
and 
their 
operating 
effectiveness. 
Our audit of internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements includes obtaining 
an understanding of such internal financial controls, 
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, 
and testing and evaluating the design and operating 
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed 
risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s 
judgement, including the assessment of the risks of 
material misstatement of the financial statements, 
whether due to fraud or error.
5.	
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our audit opinion on the internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements of the Holding 
Company and its subsidiary companies as aforesaid.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with 
Reference to Financial Statements
6.	
A company’s internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements is a process designed 
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the 
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation 
of financial statements for external purposes in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles. A company’s internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements include 
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to 
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable 
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions 
and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) 
provide reasonable assurance that transactions 
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of 
financial statements in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and 
expenditures of the company are being made only in 
accordance with authorisations of management and 
directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable 
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection 
of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the 
company’s assets that could have a material effect on 
the consolidated financial statements.

Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls 
with Reference to Financial Statements
7.	
Because of the inherent limitations of internal 
financial 
controls 
with 
reference 
to 
financial 
statements, including the possibility of collusion or 
improper management override of controls, material 
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and 
not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation 
of the internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements to future periods are subject 
to the risk that the internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements may become 
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or 
that the degree of compliance with the policies or 
procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
8.	
In our opinion the Holding Company and its 
subsidiary companies  which are companies covered 
under the Act, have in all material respects, adequate 
internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements and such controls were operating 
effectively as at 31 March 2024, based on the internal 
financial controls with reference to the financial 
statements criteria established by the respective 
companies considering the essential components 
of internal control stated in the Guidance Note 
issued by  the ICAI.

STATEMENT OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY
1.	
Corporate information:
	
Safari Industries (India) Limited (“the Holding 
Company”) is a public limited company domiciled 
in India and incorporated under the provisions of 
the Companies Act as applicable in India. Its equity 
shares are listed on BSE Ltd. (BSE) and National Stock 
Exchange of India Ltd. (NSE). The Holding Company 
is engaged in the manufacturing and marketing of 
luggage and luggage accessories.
	
The consolidated financial statement includes the 
financial statement of the Holding Company and 
its wholly owned subsidiaries, Safari Manufacturing 
Limited and Safari Lifestyles Limited.
	
Safari 
Manufacturing 
Limited 
is 
engaged 
in 
manufacturing and distribution of luggage and 
luggage accessories and Safari Lifestyles Limited is 
engaged in the marketing and distribution of luggage 
and luggage accessories The Holding Company, along 
with the aforementioned two subsidiary companies 
is, hereinafter, collectively referred to as the ‘Group’.
2.	
Material accounting policies
2.1	 General 
information 
and 
statement 
of 
compliance:
	
The Consolidated Financial Statements comprise of 
the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at 31 March 2024, 
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss (including 
other 
comprehensive 
income), 
Consolidated 
Statement of Cash Flows and Consolidated Changes 
in Equity for year ended 31 March 2024 and notes 
including material accounting policy and other 
explanatory information (hereinafter collectively 
referred to as ‘Consolidated Financial Statement’).
	
These Consolidated Financial Statements have been 
prepared in accordance with the requirements of 
Indian Accounting Standards (‘Ind AS’), prescribed 
under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (the 
‘Act’) read with Companies (Indian Accounting 
Standards) Rules, 2015 as amended and other relevant 
provisions of the Act.
	
All amounts included in the Consolidated Financial 
Statements are reported in Indian Rupees (‘INR’) 
in crores unless otherwise stated and “0” denotes 
amounts less than fifty thousand rupees.
2.2	 Basis of preparation:
	
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been 
prepared on going concern basis in accordance with 
accounting principles generally accepted in India. 
Further, the Consolidated Financial Statements have 
been prepared on historical cost basis except for the 
following material items that have been measured at 
fair value as required by relevant Ind AS:
	
1.	
Certain financial assets and liabilities (including 
derivative 
financial 
instruments) 
measured 
at fair value (refer accounting policy on 
financial instruments) ;
	
2.	
Defined benefit plan measured using actuarial 
valuation ; and
 
3. 
Share-based payments.
2.3	 Current and non- current classification
	
All assets and liabilities have been classified as current 
or non-current as per the Group’s operating cycle 
and other criteria set out in the Schedule III to the 
Companies Act, 2013. Based on the nature of products 
and the time between the acquisition of assets for 
processing and their realisation in cash and cash 
equivalents, the Group has ascertained its operating 
cycle as 12 months for the purpose of current – 
non-current classification of assets and liabilities.
2.4	 Principles of consolidation:
	
Subsidiary is an entity over which the Group has 
control. The Group controls an entity when the Group 
is exposed to, or has right to, variable returns from 
its involvement with the entity and has the ability 
to affect those returns through its power to direct 
the relevant activities of the entity. Subsidiary is 
fully consolidated from the date on which control is 
transferred to the Group. It is deconsolidated from 
the date when control ceases.
	
The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Group 
are combined on a line- by- line basis by adding 
together book values of like items of assets, liabilities, 
income 
and 
expenses, 
after 
fully 
eliminating 
intra-group balances and intra-group transactions 
resulting in unrealised profits or loss in accordance 
with Ind AS 110.
	
The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared 
using uniform accounting policy for like transactions 
and other events in similar circumstances and necessary 
adjustments required for deviations, if any, have been 
made in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

2.5	 Use of estimates and judgements:
	
The preparation of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements requires the management to make 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 
amounts 
of 
assets 
and 
liabilities, 
disclosure 
of contingent liabilities as at the date of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported 
amounts of revenues and expenses during the 
reporting period. The recognition, measurement, 
classification or disclosure of an item or information 
in the Consolidated Financial Statements made 
relying on these estimates.
	
The estimates and judgments used in the preparation 
of the Consolidated Financial Statements are 
continuously evaluated by the Group and are based on 
historical experience and various other assumptions 
and factors (including expectations of future events) 
that the Group believes to be reasonable under the 
existing circumstances. Actual results could differ 
from those estimates. Any revision to accounting 
estimates is recognised prospectively in current and 
future periods.
	
Estimation of rebates, discounts and sales
	
The revenue recognition policy requires estimation of 
rebates, discounts and sales returns. There are a varied 
number of rebates/ discount schemes offered which 
are primarily driven by the terms and conditions for 
each scheme including the working methodology to 
be followed and the eligibility criteria for each of the 
scheme. The estimates for rebates/ discounts need 
to be based on evaluation of eligibility criteria and 
the past trend analysis. The expected sales returns 
are estimated based on a detailed historical study 
of past trends.
	
Estimation of provision for inventory
	
The group writes down inventories to net realisable 
value based on an estimate of the realisability of 
inventories. Write downs on inventories are recorded 
where events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that the balances may not realised. The identification 
of write-downs requires the use of estimates of 
net selling prices of the down-graded inventories. 
Where the expectation is different from the original 
estimate, such difference will impact the carrying 
value of inventories and write-downs of inventories in 
the periods in which such estimate has been changed.
	
Estimation of defined benefit obligation.
	
The group provides defined benefit employee 
retirement plans. The present value of the defined 
benefit obligations depends on a number of 
factors that are determined on an actuarial basis 
using a number of assumptions. The assumptions 
used in determining the net cost (income) for post 
employments plans include the discount rate, salary 
escalation rate, attrition rate and mortality rate. 
Any changes in these assumptions will impact the 
carrying amount of such obligations.
	
The appropriate discount rate, salary escalation rate 
are determined and attrition rate at the end of each 
year. In determining the appropriate discount rate, 
the interest rates of government bonds of maturity 
approximating the terms of the related plan liability 
are considered and attrition rate and salary escalation 
rate is determined based on the past trends adjusted 
for expected changes in rate in the future.
	
Impairment of trade receivables.
	
The impairment provisions for trade receivable are 
based on expected credit loss method. The judgement 
is used in making the assumptions in calculating the 
default rate required for identifying the provision 
as per the expected credit loss method at the end of 
each reporting period.
	
Useful life of property, plant and equipment and 
intangible assets.
	
The useful life of the assets are determined in 
accordance with Schedule II of the Companies Act, 
2013. In cases, where the useful life is different from 
that or is not prescribed in Schedule II, it is based on 
technical advice, taking into account amongst other 
things, the nature of the asset, the estimated usage of 
Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 March 2024
192
ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24
the asset, the operating conditions of the asset, past 
history of replacement, anticipated technological 
changes, manufacturers warranties and maintenance.
	
Recognition of deferred tax assets
	
The extent to which deferred tax assets can be 
recognised is based on an assessment of the 
probability of the Company’s future taxable income 
(supported by reliable evidence) against which the 
deferred tax assets can be utilised.
	
Evaluation of indicators for impairment of assets
	
The evaluation of applicability of indicators of 
impairment of assets requires assessment of several 
external and internal factors which could result in 
deterioration of recoverable amount of the assets.
	
Contingent liabilities
	
At each balance sheet date, basis the management 
judgment, changes in facts and legal aspects, 
the Group assesses the requirement of provisions 
against 
the 
outstanding 
contingent 
liabilities. 
However, the actual future outcome may be different 
from this judgement.
	
Impairment of financial assets
	
At each balance sheet date, based on historical default 
rates observed over expected life, existing market 
conditions as well as forward looking estimates, the 
management assesses the expected credit losses on 
outstanding receivables. Further, management also 
considers the factors that may influence the credit 
risk of its customer base, including the default risk 
associated with industry and country in which the 
customer operates.
	
Government grant
	
Grants receivables are based on estimates for 
utilisation of the grant as per the regulations as well 
as analysing actual outcomes on a regular basis and 
compliance with stipulated conditions. Changes in 
estimates or non-compliance of stipulated conditions 
could lead to significant changes in grant income 
and are accounted for prospectively over the balance 
obligation period.
	
Fair value measurements
	
Management 
applies 
valuation 
techniques 
to 
determine fair value of equity shares (where active 
market quotes are not available). This involves 
developing estimates and assumptions around 
volatility, dividend yield which may affect the value 
of equity shares.
2.6	 Property, plant and equipment:
	
All the items of property, plant and equipment 
are measured at historical cost less accumulated 
depreciation 
and 
impairment 
losses, 
if 
any. 
Costs include purchase price, freight, import duties, 
non-refundable purchase taxes and other expenses 
directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. 
Cost also includes borrowing costs for long-term 
construction projects if the recognition criteria is met.
	
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying 
amount or recognised as a separate asset, as 
appropriate, only when it is probable that future 
economic benefits associated with the item will 
flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be 
measured reliably. All other expenses of repairs 
and maintenance are charged to the consolidated 
statement of profit and loss during the reporting 
period in which they are incurred.
	
Leasehold land and leasehold improvements are 
stated at historical cost less amounts amortised 
proportionate to expired lease periods.
 
Capital work-in-progress and pre-operative expenses 
during construction period:
 
Capital 
work-in-progress 
includes 
expenditure 
incurred during construction period on projects 
under implementation treated as pre-operative 
expenses 
pending 
allocation 
to 
the 
assets. 
These expenses are apportioned to the respective 
fixed assets on their completion/ commencement of 
commercial production.
	
Depreciation method, estimated useful lives and 
residual value:
 
Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method 
applying the useful lives as prescribed in part C of 
Schedule II of the Act or or per that evaluated vide 
technical evaluations.
	
The range of estimated useful lives of property, plant 
and equipment are as under:

* Useful life of plant and equipment is determined based 
on the internal assessment supported by independent 
technical evaluation.
	
The management believes that the useful lives, as 
given above, best represent the period over which the 
management expects to use these assets. The Group 
reviews the useful lives and residual value at each 
reporting date.
	
Leasehold land and leasehold improvements are 
amortised over the period of lease or their useful life 
whichever is lower.
	
Depreciation on the property, plant and equipment 
added/ disposed off/ discarded during the year is 
provided on pro rata basis with reference to the 
month of addition/ disposal/ discarding. Gains and 
losses on disposals/ derecognising the assets are 
determined by the difference between the net 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and 
recognized in the statement of profit and loss when 
the asset is derecognised.
2.7	 Intangible assets:
	
Intangible assets are held on the consolidated 
balance sheet at cost less accumulated amortisation 
and impairment losses, if any. Intangible assets 
developed or acquired with finite useful life are 
amortised on straight-line basis over the useful life as 
specified below:
Category

Trademarks
5 years
Brands
5 years
Computer software
3 years
2.8	 Impairment of non-financial assets:
	
The carrying amounts of assets are reviewed at 
each Balance Sheet date. If there is any indication 
of impairment based on internal / external factors, 
an asset is tested for impairment. When the 
carrying cost of the asset exceeds its recoverable 
value, an impairment loss is charged to Statement 
of Profit and Loss in the year in which an asset is 
identified as impaired.
	
Reversal of impairment losses recognised in prior 
years is recorded when there is an indication that the 
impairment losses recognised for the assets no longer 
exist or have decreased
2.9	 Inventories:
 
Inventories include raw material, work-in-progress, 
finished goods, stock-in-trade, stores and spares, and 
packing materials. Inventories are valued at lower 
of cost and net realisable value. Cost of inventory 
comprises all costs of purchase, duties, taxes (other 
than those subsequently recoverable from tax 
authorities) and all other costs incurred in bringing 
the inventory to their present location and condition. 
Cost is determined on weighted average basis. 
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in 
the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs 
of completion and the estimated costs necessary 
to make the sale.
	
Raw material, stores and spares and packing materials 
are not written down below cost if the finished 
products, in which they will be used, are expected to 
be sold at or above cost.
 
Finished goods and work-in-progress include costs 
of direct materials, direct labour and an appropriate 
proportion of variable and fixed manufacturing 
overheads, the latter being allocated on the basis of 
normal operating capacity.
	
Obsolete, slow moving and defective inventory are 
duly provided on the basis of management estimates.
2.10	Revenue recognition:
	
Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of 
promised products to customers in an amount that 
reflects the consideration the Group expects to 
receive in exchange for those products or services. 
Revenue is measured at transaction price net of 
rebates, discounts, sales return provision and taxes. 
A receivable is recognised by the Group when the 
control is transferred as this is the case of point in time 
recognition where consideration is unconditional 
because only the passage of time is required. 
No significant element of financing is deemed present 
as the sales are either made with a nil credit term or 
with a credit period of 0-90 days. The Group applies 
the revenue recognition criteria to each component 
of the revenue transaction as set out below.
Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 March 2024
194
ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24
	
Income from sale of goods: Revenue from products 
is recognized as and when the control of products 
is transferred to the customer. The Group considers 
its customary business practices to determine the 
transaction price. The transaction price is the amount 
of consideration to which the Group expects to be 
entitled in exchange for the products, excluding 
amounts collected on behalf of third parties (for 
example, indirect taxes).
	
Other income: Dividend income on investments 
is recognised when the right to receive dividend is 
established. Interest income is recognised on a time 
proportionate basis taking into account the amounts 
invested and the rate of interest.
	
Trade receivables: A receivable represents the 
Group’s right to an amount of consideration under 
the contract with a customer that is unconditional 
and realisable on the due date.
2.11 Financial instruments:
	
A financial instrument is any contract that gives 
rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial 
liability or equity instrument of another entity.
A.	
Non-derivative financial instruments:
1.	
Financial assets:
	
(i)	
Initial recognition and measurement:
	
	
Financial assets are recognised when the Group 
becomes a party to the contractual provisions 
of the instruments. On initial recognition, 
financial assets, other than trade receivables, 
are measured at fair value. In case of financial 
assets which are recognised at fair value through 
profit or loss (FVTPL), their transaction costs are 
recognised in the consolidated statement of 
profit and loss. In other cases, the transaction 
costs are attributed to the acquisition value of 
the financial asset.
	
(ii)	 Subsequent measurement:
	
	
Financial 
assets 
are 
classified 
as 
subsequently measured at:
	
	
(a)	 Amortised cost,
	
	
(b)	 Fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”) or
	
	
(c)	
Fair value through other comprehensive 
income (“FVOCI”)
	
	
The above classification is being determined 
considering:
	
	
(a)	 the entity’s business model for managing 
the financial assets and
	
	
(b)	 the contractual cash flow characteristics of 
the financial asset.
	
	
Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to 
their recognition, except if and in the period the 
Group changes its business model for managing 
the financial assets.
	
	
(a)	 Measured at amortised cost:
	
	
	
Financial assets are subsequently measured 
at amortised cost, if these financial assets 
are held within a business model whose 
objective is to hold these assets in order 
to collect contractual cash flows and the 
contractual terms of the financial asset give 
rise on specified date to cash flows that are 
solely payments of principal and interest on 
the principal amount outstanding.
	
	
(b)	 Measured at FVOCI:
	
	
	
Financial assets are subsequently measured 
at FVOCI, if these financial assets are held 
within a business model whose objective 
is achieved by both collecting contractual 
cash flows that give rise on specified 
dates to solely payments of principal 
and interest on the principal amount 
outstanding and selling financial assets. 
Fair value movements are recognised in the 
consolidated other comprehensive income 
(“OCI”). Interest income measured using 
the effective interest rate (EIR) method and 
impairment losses, if any are recognised 
in the consolidated statement of profit 
and loss. On derecognition, cumulative 
gain or loss previously recognised in the 
consolidated OCI is reclassified from equity 
to the consolidated statement of profit 
and loss under the head ‘Other income’/ 
“Other expenses’.
	
	
(c)	
Measured at FVTPL:
	
	
	
Financial assets, other than investment 
in equity instruments, are subsequently 
measured at FVTPL unless they are measured 
at amortised cost or at FVOCI. Such financial 
assets are measured at fair value with all 
changes in fair value, including interest 
income and dividend income if any, 
recognised in the consolidated statement 
of profit and loss.
	
	
	
Investment in equity instruments:
	
	
	
On initial recognition, the Group can make 
an irrevocable election (on an instrument-by-

instrument basis) to present the subsequent 
changes in fair value in consolidated OCI 
that would otherwise be measured at 
FVTPL pertaining to investments in equity 
instruments. This election is not permitted 
if the equity investment is held for trading. 
These elected investments are initially 
measured at fair value plus transaction 
costs. Subsequently, they are measured 
at fair value with gains and losses arising 
from changes in fair value recognised 
in consolidated OCI and accumulated 
in the ‘Reserve for equity instruments 
through other comprehensive income’. 
The cumulative gain or loss is not reclassified 
to the consolidated statement of profit 
and loss on disposal of the investments. 
However, the Group may transfer the 
cumulative gain or loss within equity.
	
	
	
Dividend 
on 
these 
investments 
in 
equity instruments is recognised in the 
consolidated statement of profit and loss 
under the head ‘Other income’ when the 
Group’s right to receive the dividend is 
established, it is probable that the economic 
benefits associated with the dividend will 
flow to the entity, the dividend does not 
represent a recovery of part of cost of the 
investment and the amount of dividend can 
be measured reliably.
	
(iii)	 Impairment:
	
	
The Group recognises a loss allowance for 
expected credit losses (“ECL”) on financial assets 
that are measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI. 
The credit loss is the difference between all 
contractual cash flows that are due to an entity 
in accordance with the contract and all the cash 
flows that the entity expects to receive (i.e. 
all cash shortfalls), discounted at the original EIR. 
This is assessed on an individual or collective basis 
after considering all reasonable and supportable 
including that which is forward-looking.
	
	
The Group’s trade receivables do not contain 
significant 
financing 
component 
and 
loss 
allowance on trade receivables is measured 
at an amount equal to lifetime ECL i.e. 
expected 
cash 
shortfalls, 
being 
simplified 
approach for recognition of impairment loss 
allowance. Under simplified approach, the 
Group does not track changes in credit risk. 
Rather it recognises impairment loss allowance 
based on the lifetime ECL at each reporting date 
right from its initial recognition. The Group uses 
a provision matrix to determine impairment loss 
allowance on the portfolio of trade receivables. 
The provision matrix is based on its historically 
observed default rates over the expected life 
of the trade receivable and is adjusted for 
forward-looking estimates. At every reporting 
date, the historically observed default rates are 
updated and changes in the forward-looking 
estimates are analysed
	
	
For financial assets other than trade receivables, 
the Group recognises 12-month ECL for all 
originated or acquired financial assets if at the 
reporting date the credit risk of the financial 
asset has not increased significantly since its 
initial recognition. The ECL are measured as 
lifetime ECL if the credit risk on financial asset 
increases significantly since its initial recognition. 
If, in a subsequent period, credit quality of the 
instrument improves such that there is no longer 
significant increase in credit risks since initial 
recognition, then the Group reverts to recognising 
impairment loss allowance based on 12-month 
ECL. The impairment losses and reversals are 
recognised in the consolidated statement of 
profit and loss. For equity instruments and 
financial assets measured at FVTPL, there is no 
requirement of impairment testing.
	
(iv)	 Derecognition:
	
	
The Group derecognises a financial asset when,
	
	
(a)	 the contractual rights to the cash flows 
from the financial asset expire, or
	
	
(b)	 it transfers the contractual rights to 
receive the cash flows of the financial 
asset and has substantially transferred all 
the risks and rewards of ownership of the 
financial asset, or
	
	
(c)	
it retains the contractual rights to receive 
the cash flows of the financial asset, but 
assumes a contractual obligation to pay the 
cash flows without material delay to one 
or more recipients under a pass through 
arrangement 
(thereby 
substantially 
transferring all the risks and rewards of 
ownership of the financial asset), or
	
	
(d)	 it has neither transferred nor retained 
substantially all of the risks and rewards of 
ownership of the financial asset and does 
not retain control over the financial asset.

When the Group transfers a financial 
asset, it evaluates the extent to which 
it has retained the risks and rewards of 
ownership of the financial asset. If the 
Group has neither transferred nor retained 
substantially all of the risks and rewards of 
ownership of the financial asset, but retains 
control of the financial asset, the Group 
continues to recognise such financial asset 
to the extent of its continuing involvement 
in the financial asset. In that case, the 
Group also recognises an associated liability. 
The financial asset and the associated 
liability are measured on a basis that 
reflects the rights and obligations that the 
Group has retained.
2.	
Financial liabilities:
(i)	 Initial recognition and measurement:
	
Financial liabilities are recognised when the Group 
becomes a party to the contractual provisions of 
the instruments. Financial liabilities are initially 
recognised at fair value, net of directly attributable 
transaction costs for all financial liabilities not 
carried at FVTPL.
(ii)	 Subsequent measurement:
 
The Group subsequently measures all non-derivative 
financial liabilities at amortised cost using EIR 
method. A gain or loss on a financial liability 
measured at amortised cost is recognised in the 
consolidated statement of profit and loss when the 
financial liability is derecognised and through EIR 
amortisation process.
	
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account 
any discount or premium on acquisition and 
fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. 
The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in 
the consolidated statement of profit and loss.
(iii)	Derecognition:
	
A financial liability is derecognised when the 
obligation under the liability is discharged or 
cancelled or expires. When an existing financial 
liability is replaced by another from the same lender 
on substantially different terms, or the terms of 
an existing liability are substantially modified, 
such an exchange or modification is treated as 
the derecognition of the original liability and 
the recognition of a new liability. The difference 
between the carrying amount of the financial 
liability derecognized and the consideration paid is 
recognised in the statement of profit and loss.
	
Offsetting of financial instruments:
	
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset 
and the net amount is reported in the consolidated 
balance sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal 
right to offset the recognised amounts and there is 
an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the 
assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
3.	
Equity instruments:
	
An equity instrument is a contract that evidences 
residual interest in the assets of the Company after 
deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments 
issued by the Group are recognised at the proceeds 
received, net of direct issue costs.
	
Repurchase of the Group’s own equity instruments is 
recognised and deducted directly in equity. No gain 
or loss is recognised in the statement of profit and 
loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the 
Group’s own equity instruments. Dividends paid on 
equity instruments are directly reduced from equity.
4.	
Compound financial instruments:
	
The component parts of compound instruments 
(convertible debentures) issued by the Group are 
classified separately as financial liabilities and equity 
in accordance with the substance of the contractual 
arrangements and the definitions of a financial 
liability and an equity instrument.
	
At the date of issue, the fair value of the liability 
component is estimated using the prevailing market 
interest rates. This amount is recorded as a liability 
on an amortised cost basis using the effective interest 
method until extinguished upon conversion or at the 
instrument’s maturity date.
	
The conversion option classified as equity is 
determined by deducting the amount of the liability 
component from the fair value of the compound 
instrument as a whole. This is recognised and included 
in equity, net of income tax effects, and is not 
subsequently remeasured. In addition, the conversion 
option classified as equity will remain in equity until 
the conversion option is exercised, in which case, the 
balance recognised in equity will be transferred to 
other component of equity.
	
Transaction costs that relate to the issue of the 
convertible instruments are allocated to the liability 
and equity components in proportion to the 
allocation of the gross proceeds. Transaction costs 
relating to the equity component are recognised 
directly in equity. Transaction costs relating to the 
liability component are included in the carrying 
amount of the liability component and are amortised

over the lives of the convertible instrument using the 
effective interest method.
B.	
Derivative financial instruments:
	
The Group uses derivative financial instruments, such 
as forward foreign exchange contracts, to hedge 
its foreign currency risks. Such derivative financial 
instruments are initially recognised at fair value on 
the date on which a derivative contract is entered into 
and are subsequently remeasured at fair value, with 
changes in fair value recognised in the consolidated 
statement of profit and loss.
2.12	 Fair value measurement:
	
The Group measures financial instruments at fair value 
at each balance sheet date. Fair value is the price that 
would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer 
a liability in an orderly transaction between market 
participants at the measurement date. The fair value 
measurement is based on the presumption that the 
transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability 
takes place either:
	
2.12.1	
in the principal market for the asset 
or liability, or
	
2.12.2	
in the absence of a principal market, in 
the most advantageous market for the 
asset or liability.
	
The principal or the most advantageous market must 
be accessible by the Group.
	
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured 
using the assumptions that market participants would 
use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that 
market participants act in their best economic interest.
 
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset 
takes into account a market participant’s ability to 
generate economic benefits by using the asset in its 
highest and best use or by selling it to another market 
participant that would use the asset in its highest and 
best use. The Group uses valuation techniques that 
are appropriate in the circumstances and for which 
sufficient data are available to measure fair value, 
maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and 
minimising the use of unobservable inputs. All assets 
and liabilities for which fair value is measured or 
disclosed in the Consolidated Financial Statements are 
categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described 
as follows, based on the lowest level input that is 
significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:
	
Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets 
for identical assets or liabilities.
	
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included 
within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or 
liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. 
derived from prices).
	
Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based 
on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
	
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the 
financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group 
determines whether transfers have occurred between 
levels in the hierarchy by reassessing categorisation 
(based on the lowest level input that is significant to 
the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of 
each reporting period
	
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group 
has determined classes of assets and liabilities on 
the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of 
the asset or liability and the level of the fair value 
hierarchy as explained above.
2.13	Foreign currency transactions:
	
The Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements are 
presented in INR which is also its functional currency.
	
a)	
Initial recognition:
	
	
Transactions in foreign currency are recorded 
at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of 
the transaction. Exchange differences arising on 
foreign exchange transactions settled during 
the year are recognised in the consolidated 
statement of profit and loss for the year.
	
b)	
Measurement of foreign currency items at the 
balance sheet date:
	
	
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currency remaining unsettled at the end 
of the year are translated at the closing exchange 
rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
	
	
Exchange differences arising on settlement or 
translation of monetary items are recognised in 
the consolidated statement of profit and loss.
 
 
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that 
are denominated in foreign currencies are 
retranslated at the rates prevailing at the 
date when the fair value was determined. 
Non-monetary items that are measured in 
terms of historical cost in a foreign currency 
are not retranslated. The gain or loss arising on 
Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 March 2024
198
ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24
translation of non-monetary items measured at 
fair value is treated in line with the recognition 
of the gain or loss on the change in fair value 
of the item (i.e. translation differences on items 
whose fair value gain or loss is recognised in the 
consolidated OCI or the consolidated statement 
of profit and loss are also reclassified in the 
consolidated OCI or the consolidated statement 
of profit and loss, respectively)
2.14	Taxes on income:
	
Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. 
Income tax expense is recognised in the consolidated 
statement of profit and loss except to the extent it 
relates to items directly recognised in equity or in 
consolidated OCI.
	
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year. 
Taxable profit is different from accounting profit due 
to temporary difference between accounting and tax 
treatments, and due to items that are never taxable or 
tax deductible. Tax provisions are included in current 
liabilities. Interest and penalties on tax liabilities are 
provided for in the tax charge. The Group offsets, 
the current tax assets and liabilities (on a year-on-
year basis) where it has a legally enforceable right 
and where it intends to settle such assets and 
liabilities on a net basis or to realise the assets and 
liabilities on net basis.
	
Deferred income tax is recognised using the balance 
sheet approach. Deferred income tax assets and 
liabilities are recognised for deductible and taxable 
temporary differences arising between the tax base 
of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount 
in the respective components financial statements. 
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the 
extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be 
available against which the deductible temporary 
differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits 
and unused tax losses can be utilised. Deferred tax 
assets are not recognised when it is more likely than 
not that the assets will not be realised in the future.
	
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets 
is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to 
the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient 
taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of 
the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
	
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are 
measured at the tax rates that are expected to 
apply in the period when the asset is realised or the 
liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
reporting date.
	
Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation 
to the underlying transaction either in OCI or 
directly in equity.
	
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are 
offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off 
current income tax assets against current income tax 
liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same 
taxable entity and the same taxation authority
2.15	Employee benefits:
 
The Group has following post-employment plans:
	
(a)	 Defined 
contribution 
plan 
such 
as 
provident fund and
 
(b) Defined benefit plan- Gratuity
	
(c)	
Compensated Absences
a)	
Defined contribution plan:
	
Under defined contribution plans, the Group pays 
pre-defined amounts to separate funds and does 
not have any legal or informal obligation to pay 
additional sums. Defined contribution plan comprise 
of contributions to the employees’ provident fund 
with the government and certain state plans such as 
employees’ state insurance and employees’ pension 
scheme. The Group’s payments to the defined 
contribution plans are recognised as expenses during 
the period in which the employees perform the 
services that the payment covers.
b)	
Defined benefit plan:
	
The liability or asset recognised in the consolidated 
balance sheet in respect of defined benefit gratuity 
plan is the present value of defined benefit 
obligations at the end of the reporting period less fair 
value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligations 
is calculated annually by actuary through actuarial 
valuation using the projected unit credit method.
	
The Group recognises the following changes in the 
net defined benefit obligation as an expense in the 
consolidated statement of profit and loss:
	
Service costs comprising current service costs, past 
service costs, gains and losses on curtailment and 
non-routine settlements; and
	
Net interest expense or income
	
The net interest cost is calculated by applying the 
discount rate to the net balance of the defined

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets. 
This cost is included in ‘Employee benefits expense’ in 
the consolidated statement of profit and loss.
	
Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability/ 
(asset) comprising:
	
(i)	
actuarial (gains)/ losses,
	
(ii)	 return on plan assets, excluding amounts 
included in interest income and
	
(iii)	 any change in the effect of the asset ceiling, 
excluding amounts included in interest income
	
are recognised in the period in which they occur 
directly in the consolidated OCI. Remeasurements are 
not reclassified to the consolidated statement of profit 
and loss in subsequent periods.
	
Ind AS 19 “Employee benefits” requires the exercise 
of judgment in relation to various assumptions 
including future pay rises, inflation, discount rates 
and employee demographics. The Group determines 
the assumptions in conjunction with its actuaries, and 
believes these assumptions to be in line with best 
practice, but the application of different assumptions 
could have a significant effect on the amounts 
reflected in the consolidated statement of profit 
and loss, consolidated OCI and consolidated balance 
sheet. There may also be interdependency between 
some of the assumptions.
c)	
Compensated Absences:
	
The Group had a policy on compensated absences 
which were both accumulating and non accumulating 
in nature. In the previous year, the Company had 
revised it policy for compensated absences to allow 
leave entitlements which would be non-accumulating 
in nature except for a certain class of employees. 
Expense on non-accumulating compensated absences 
is recognised in the period in which the absences 
occur. Necessary impact of the same had been 
considered in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
	
The Company presents the entire leave as a current 
liability in the Balance Sheet, since it does not have 
any unconditional right to defer its settlement for 
twelve months after the reporting date.
2.16	 Share based payments:
 
Equity-settled share-based payments to employees 
are measured at the fair value of the equity 
instruments at the grant date using an appropriate 
valuation model.
	
The fair value determined at the grant date of the 
equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on 
a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based 
on the Group’s estimate of equity instruments that 
will eventually vest, with a corresponding increase 
in equity. At the end of each reporting period, the 
Group revises its estimate of the number of equity 
instruments expected to vest. The impact of the 
revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised 
in the consolidated statement of profit and loss such 
that the cumulative expense reflects the revised 
estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to the 
equity-settled share-based payment reserve.
	
No expense is recognised for ESOPs that do not 
ultimately vest because non-market performance 
and/ or service conditions have not been met.
	
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected 
as additional share dilution in the computation of 
diluted earnings per equity share.
2.17	 Leases:
	
The Group’s lease asset classes primarily consist of 
leases for buildings. The Group assesses whether 
a contract is, or contains, a lease, at inception of 
a contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the 
contract conveys the right to control the use of an 
identified asset for a period of time in exchange for 
consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys 
the right to control the use of an identified asset, the 
Group assesses whether:
	
the contract involves the use of an identified asset,
	
(i)	
the Group has the right to obtain substantially 
all of the economic benefits from use of the 
identified asset ,	
throughout the period of 
use, and
	
(ii)	 the Group has the right to direct the use of the 
identified asset, throughout the period of use.
	
At the date of commencement of the lease, the Group 
recognises a right-of-use asset and a corresponding 
lease liability for all lease arrangements in which it 
is a lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve 
months or less (short-term leases) and leases of low 
value assets. For these short-term leases and leases 
of low value assets, the Group recognises the lease 
Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 March 2024
200
ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24
payments as an operating expense on a straight-line 
basis over the term of the lease.
 
The right-of-use assets are initially recognised at 
cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease 
liability. They are subsequently measured at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if 
any. Right-of- use assets are depreciated from the 
commencement date on a straight-line basis over 
the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the 
underlying asset.
	
The lease liability is initially measured at the present 
value of the future lease payments. The lease 
payments are discounted using the interest rate 
implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, 
using the incremental borrowing rates. The lease 
liability is subsequently remeasured by increasing 
the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease 
liability and reducing the carrying amount to reflect 
the lease payments made.
	
A lease liability is remeasured upon the occurrence of 
certain events such as a change in the lease term or 
a change in an index or rate used to determine lease 
payments. The remeasurement normally also adjusts 
the leased assets. Lease liabilities and right-of-use 
assets have been separately presented in the Balance 
Sheet and lease payments have been classified as 
financing cash flows.
2.18 Provisions and contingencies:
	
A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past 
event, the Group has a present legal or constructive 
obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is 
probable that an outflow of economic benefits will 
be required to settle the obligation. Provisions for 
onerous contracts are recognised when the expected 
benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract 
are lower than the unavoidable costs of meeting the 
future obligations under the contract.
	
A disclosure for contingent liabilities is made where 
there is a possible obligation or a present obligation 
that may probably not require an outflow of resources 
or an obligation for which the future outcome cannot 
be ascertained with reasonable certainty. When there 
is a possible or a present obligation where the 
likelihood of outflow of resources is remote, no 
provision or disclosure is made.
2.19	 Cash and cash equivalents:
	
Cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance 
sheet and for the purpose of consolidated statement 
of cash flows include cash and cheque in hand, bank 
balances, demand deposits with banks and other 
short-term highly liquid investments that are readily 
convertible to known amounts of cash and which are 
subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value 
where original maturity is three months or less.
2.20	Earnings per equity share:
	
Basic earnings per equity share are calculated 
by dividing the net profit/ (loss) for the period 
attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted 
average number of equity shares outstanding during 
the period. Earnings considered in ascertaining 
the Group’s earnings per equity share is the net 
profit/ (loss) for the period. The weighted average 
number of equity shares outstanding during the 
period and for all periods presented is adjusted for 
events, such as bonus shares, share split, share-based 
payments, etc. that have changed the number of 
equity shares outstanding, without a corresponding 
change in resources.
	
For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per 
equity share, the net profit/ (loss) for the period 
attributable to equity shareholders and the weighted 
average number of equity shares outstanding during 
the period is adjusted for the effects of all dilutive 
potential equity shares.
2.21	 Borrowing costs :
	
General and specific borrowing costs that are 
directly attributable to the acquisition, construction 
or production of qualifying assets are capitalised as 
a part of cost of those assets during the period till 
all the activities necessary to prepare the qualifying 
assets for their intended use or sale are complete. 
Qualifying assets are assets that necessarily take 
a substantial period of time to get ready for their 
intended use or sale.
	
All other borrowing costs are recognised as an 
expense in the period in which they are incurred.
2.22	 Exceptional items :
	
When an item of income or expense within profit/ 
(loss) from ordinary activity is of such size, nature or 
incidence that their disclosure is relevant to explain 
the performance of the Group for the year, the nature 
and amount of such items is disclosed separately in 
the consolidated statement of profit and loss.

2.23	 Segment reporting:
	
As the Group’s business activity primarily falls 
within a single business of luggage and luggage 
accessory and geographical segment (domestic) 
and the Chief Operating Decision Maker monitors 
the operating results of its business units not 
separately for the purpose of making decisions about 
resource allocation and performance assessment. 
Segment performance is evaluated based on profit or 
loss and is measured consistently with profit or loss in 
the Consolidated Financial Statements, thus there are 
no additional disclosure to be provided under Ind As 
108 – Segment Reporting.
2.24	 Recent pronouncements:
	
The Ministry of Corporate Affairs has notified 
Companies 
(Indian 
Accounting 
Standards) 
Amendment Rules, 2023 dated 31 March 2023 to 
amend the following ind AS which are effective for 
annual periods beginning on or after 1 April 2023. 
	
The Group applied for the first time these 
amendments.
	
(i)	
Definition of Accounting Estimates-Amendments 
to Ind AS 8
	
	
The amendments clarify the distinction between 
changes in accounting estimates and changes 
in accounting policies and the correction of 
errors. It has also been clarified how entities use 
measurement techniques and inputs to develop 
accounting estimates. The amendments had no 
impact on the Group’s financial statements.
	
(ii)	 Disclosure of Accounting Policies-Amendments 
to Ind AS 1
	
	
The amendments aim to help entities provide 
accounting policy disclosures that are more 
useful by replacing the requirement for entities 
to disclose their ‘significant’ accounting policies 
with a requirement to disclose their ‘Material 
accounting policy information and adding 
guidance on how entitles apply the concept of 
materiality in making decisions about accounting 
policy disclosures. The amendments have had an 
impact on the Group’s disclosures of accounting 
policies, 
but 
not 
on 
the 
measurement, 
recognition or presentation of any items in the 
Group’s financial statements.
	
(iii)	 Deferred 
Tax 
related 
to 
Assets 
and 
Liabilities 
arising 
from 
a 
Single 
Transaction-Amendments to Ind AS 12
	
	
The amendments narrow the scope of the initial 
recognition exception under Ind AS 12, so that 
it no longer applies to transactions that give 
rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary 
differences such has leases. The Group previously 
recognised for deferred tax on leases on a net 
basis. As a result of these amendments, the 
Group has recognised a separate deferred tax 
asset in relation to its lease liabilities and a 
deferred tax liability in relation to its right-of-
use assets. Since, these balances qualify for 
offset as per the requirements of paragraph 74 
of Ind AS 12, there is no impact in the balance 
sheet. There was also no impact on the opening 
retained earnings as at 1 April 2022. Apart from 
these, consequential amendments and editorials 
have been made to other Ind AS like Ind AS 101, 
Ind AS 102, Ind AS 103, Ind AS 107, Ind AS 109, 
Ind AS 115 and Ind AS 34

Extension and termination option
Extension and termination options are included in a number of leases across the Group. These are used to maximise 
operational flexibility in terms of managing the assets used in the Group’s operations. The majority of extension and 
termination options held are excersiable when mutually agreed between the lessor and the Group.
Variable lease payments
Some property leases contain variable payment terms that are linked to sales generated from a store. Variable payment 
terms are used for a variety of reasons, including minimising the fixed costs base for newly established stores. Variable lease 
payments that depend on sales are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which the condition that triggers those 
payments occurs.

These assumptions were developed by the management of the Holding Company with the assistance of 
independent actuarial appraisers. Discount factors are determined close to each year end by reference to 
government bonds of relevant economic markets and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms 
of the related obligation. Other assumptions are based on management’s historical experience. The estimate 
of future salary increase considered in actuarial valuation take account of inflation, seniority, promotion and 
other relevant factors such as supply and demand in the employment market.

The sensitivity analysis have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective 
assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions constant.
	
	
The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the projected benefit 
obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of 
the assumptions may be correlated.	
	
	
Furthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the projected benefit obligation 
has been calculated using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which is the 
same method as applied in calculating the projected benefit obligation as recognised in the balance sheet.
	
	
There was no change in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis from prior years.
	
viii)	 Risks associated with defined benefit plan:
	
	
Gratuity is a defined benefit plan and entity is exposed to the following risks:
Interest rate risk
A fall in the discount rate which is linked to the Government Securities rate will 
increase the present value of the liability requiring higher provision. A fall in the 
discount rate generally increases the mark to market value of the assets depending 
on the duration of asset.
Salary risk
The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the 
future salaries of members. As such, an increase in the salary of the members more 
than assumed level will increase the plan's liability.
Investment risk
The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount 
rate which is determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting 
period on government bonds. If the return on plan asset is below this rate, it will 
create a plan deficit.
Asset Liability 
Matching ('ALM') risk
The plan faces the ALM risk as to the matching cash flow. Since the plan is invested in 
lines of Rule 101 of Income Tax Rules, 1962, this generally reduces ALM risk.
Mortality risk
Since the benefits under the plan is not payable for life time and payable till retirement 
age only, plan does not have any longevity risk. Mortality rate during employment 
is calculated considering Indian Assured Lives Mortality 2012-14 (Urban) (Previous 
year:Indian Assured Lives Mortality 2012-14 (Urban)
Concentration risk 
Plan is having a concentration risk as all the assets are invested with the insurance 
company and a default will wipe out all the assets. Although probability of this is very 
less as insurance companies have to follow regulatory guidelines which mitigate risk

Volatility
Volatility of the Holding Company's stock price based on the price data commensurate 
with the expected life of options upto the date of grant.
Risk free rate
The risk free rate being considered for the calculation is the interest rate applicable 
for a maturity equal to the expected life of the options based on zero coupon yield 
curve for government securities.
Expected 
life of options
The period upto vesting date plus the exercise period corresponding to each vesting.
Dividend yield
Expected dividend yield has been calculated by dividing the last declared dividend per 
share by the market price per share as on the date of grant.

Fair value hierarchy 
	
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial 
instruments by valuation technique:	
	
Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
	
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either 
directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
	
Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
	
The carrying amounts and fair values of financial instruments by category are as follows:
	
Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value - recurring fair value measurements

Valuation techniques used to determine fair value
	
The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities are included at the amount that would be received to sell an asset 
and paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. The following methods were 
used to estimate the fair values:
 
- 
Other non-current financial assets and liabilities : the carrying value is considered to be approximate to 
their fair value.
 
- 
Derivative financial assets and liabilities: The Group enters into derivative contracts with various counterparties, 
principally financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. Forward foreign currency contracts are 
determined using forward exchange rates at the reporting date.
 
- 
Current investments-The fair values of investments in mutual fund units is based on the net asset value (‘NAV’) 
as stated by the issuers of these mutual fund units in the published statements as at Balance Sheet date. 
NAV represents the price at which the issuer will issue further units of mutual fund and the price at which 
issuers will redeem such units from the investors.
 
- 
Trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents, other bank balances, loans, other current financial assets, 
trade payables and other current financial liabilities: Approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the 
short-term maturities of these instruments.
 
- 
Borrowings taken by the Group are as per the Group’s credit and liquidity risk assessment and there is no 
comparable instrument having the similar terms and conditions with related security being pledged and hence 
the carrying value of the borrowings represents the best estimate of its fair value.
	
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis, the 
Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation 
(based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each 
reporting period.
	
Fair value of assets and liabilities which are measured at amortised cost for which fair value are

II)	
Financial risk management
	
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s 
primary focus is to foresee the unpredictability of financial markets and seek to minimise potential adverse effects 
on its financial performance. The primary market risk to the Group is foreign exchange risk. The Board of Directors 
of the Holding Company reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below:

Market risk	
(a)	 Interest rate risk
	
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of the financial instruments will fluctuate because 
of changes in market interest rates.  The Group is mainly exposed to this risk due to borrowings having variable 
rate of interest.
	
Exposure to interest rate risk

 52.05 
	
Interest rate sensitivity
	
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates on that portion of 
borrowings affected. With all other variables held constant, the Group’s profit or loss before tax is affected through 
the impact on floating rate borrowings, as follows:
Particulars
Impact on profit or loss and 
total equity
As at 
31 March 2024
As at 
31 March 2023
Floating rate instruments:
50 basis points increase
 (0.16)
 (0.26)
50 basis points decrease
 0.16 
 0.26 
Hence, the Group is not significantly exposed to the interest rate risk as working capital facilities are, as per 
contractual terms, primarily of short term in nature.
(b)	 Foreign currency risk 
	
Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of 
changes in foreign exchange rates. The Group’s foreign exchange risk arises from its trade payables and trade 
receivables denominated in foreign currencies. The results of the Group’s operations can be affected as the Indian 
Rupees (‘INR’) is volatile against these currencies. The Group enters into derivative financial instruments such as

B	
Credit risk 
	
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to 
meet its contractual obligations, and arises from cash and cash equivalents, bank balances other than cash and 
cash equivalents, other financial assets as well as credit exposures to customers including outstanding receivables. 
The maximum exposure to credit risk is equal to the carrying value of the financial assets. 
	
The objective of managing counterparty credit risk is to prevent losses in financial assets. The Group assesses the 
credit quality of the counterparties, taking into account their financial position, past experience and other factors. 
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its expected credit losses in respect of trade and 
other receivables. The management uses a simplified approach for the purpose of computation of allowance for 
expected credit loss for trade receivables.
	
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. 
The demographics of the customer, including the default risk of the industry and country, in which the customer 
operates, also has an influence on credit risk assessment. Credit risk is managed through credit approvals, establishing 
credit limits, continuously monitoring the credit worthiness of customers.
	
In respect of trade receivables, the Group is not exposed to any significant credit risk exposure to any single 
counterparty or any Group of counterparties having similar characteristics. Trade receivables consist of a large 
number of customers in various geographical areas. The Group has very limited history of customer default, and 
considers the credit quality of trade receivables for evaluation of allowance for expected credit loss.
	
The credit risk on liquid funds such as balance in current and deposit accounts with banks and derivative financial 
instruments (included in other financial assets) is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings.

Liquidity risk
	
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they become due.

Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors of the respective entities, 
which has established an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Group’s 
short-term, medium-term and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements. The  Group manages 
liquidity risk by maintaining adequate  reserves, banking facilities and committed borrowing facilities, by continuously 
monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, and by matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities 
and by monitoring rolling forecasts of its liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational 
needs while maintaining sufficient headroom on its undrawn committed borrowing facilities at all times so that the 
Group does not breach borrowing limits or covenants (where applicable) on any of its borrowing facilities.

Ind AS 108 ‘Operating Segments’ (‘Ind AS 108’) establishes standards for the way that business enterprises report 
information about operating segments and related disclosures about revenue, geographic areas and major customers.

(‘CODM’) as defined under Ind AS 108 “Operating Segments”. As the Group business activity primarily falls within a

of its business units not separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance 
assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on profit or loss and is measured consistently with profit or 
loss in the consolidated financial statements, thus there are no additional disclosures to be provided under Ind AS
