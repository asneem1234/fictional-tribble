Statement by director responsible for the 
business 
responsibility report, high-
lighting ESG related challenges, targets, 
and achievements 
I am happy to present to you the latest edition of OIL's 
Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR), 
which is prepared in accordance with SEBI guidelines. 
BRSR reflects our efforts and progress towards a 
sustainable future, marked by significant milestones and a 
deep sense of responsibility to our Nation and its people.  
As an early adopter of ESG reporting in India, OIL 
consistently endeavors to enhance its disclosures aligned 
with international and national standards. As a Maharatna 
energy company, we are tasked with ensuring nation’s 
energy security, we are deeply committed to the highest 
standards of transparency, integrity & accountability, 
uphold corporate governance principles and maintain 
ethical and responsible business practices across all our 
operations. At OIL, sustainability is a core value, it is our 
guiding principle to add to the energy security of the 
country.  
As the energy sector shifts towards cleaner and more 
sustainable sources, OIL recognizes the need to adapt. 
We've recently adopted Vision & Strategy 2040, developed 
with international consultants, to guide our transformation 
into an Integrated Energy Player. 
 
Aligned with this vision and India's ambitious emission 
reduction target, OIL is committed to becoming a net-zero 
company by 2040. We are envisaging to invest ₹25,000 Cr 
by 2040 for development of Alternate energy through a 
wholly owned subsidiary company dedicated to manage 
Alternate Energy Business of OIL. The process has been 
initiated for the incorporation of wholly owned subsidiary 
company.  This investment will drive growth in renewable 
energy, biofuels, compressed bio gas, green hydrogen, bio

ethanol, CCS / CCUS and Geothermal etc.  
To strengthen our energy portfolio further, we're exploring 
diversification in downstream operations. This includes 
investments in refining facilities, petrochemicals, LNG 
infrastructure, fertilizers, and critical minerals exploration. 
 
Our focus is on delivering sustainable growth and 
generating long-term value. We will invest in our people, 
technology, and infrastructure to maintain our competitive 
edge and seize emerging opportunities in the evolving 
energy landscape.

2. a. Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)  
Yes, at OIL, we are committed to maintaining responsible and sustainable practices in all our operations, 
including our vendor selection process. Our dedication extends to considering social, ethical, and 
environmental factors in our decision-making. We have established a robust and transparent tendering 
process that complies with relevant laws and regulations. Our tender processes are conducted online and 
paperless to provide equal opportunities to eligible bidders and maintain transparency. Our tender invitations 
include clauses addressing critical issues such as the prohibition of child labor and the welfare of contractual 
labor to ensure a fair and ethical execution of the process. Additionally, we have integrated environment-
related screening parameters that require compliance with global and national standards as the establishment 
of performance criteria. We also provide weightage to ESG related elements while analysing scoring the 
technical bid submitted by the vendors. These considerations are rigorously evaluated on a tender-to-tender 
basis to promote sustainability and minimize our ecological impact. Furthermore, we actively support local 
vendors and contribute to the vision of Aatmanirbhar Bharat by implementing purchase preference 
conditions that prioritize engaging with local suppliers and small or medium-scale industries.

3. Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling, and disposing 
at the end of life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other 
waste.   
 
Product 
Process to safely reclaim the product 
 
27 
 
BRSR 2023-24 
a. Plastics (including 
packaging) 
Product recycling is not practiced in this sector. The product portfolio consists 
mainly of crude oil, natural gas and value-added products (LPG,), which cannot 
be recycled. 
b. E-Waste 
Disposed via registered recyclers 
c. Hazardous Waste 
Oily Sludge Recovered through in-house sludge processing plant for reuse as 
crude oil and Remaining sludge undergoes bioremediation for proper disposal. 
 
Spent Oil: Sold to authorized recyclers/re-processors for further processing. 
d. Other Waste 
All Non-hazardous wastes are properly stored and disposed as per regulation 
 
4. Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes / No). If 
yes, whether the waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan 
submitted to Pollution Control Boards? If not, provide steps taken to address the same.  
 
No. 
The oil and gas industry being a complex and diverse sector, with a wide range of products and services. 
This makes it difficult to develop a single EPR system that would be effective for all segments of the 
industry. It is heavily regulated, with a number of existing laws and regulations governing the management 
of waste. These regulations often include requirements for producers to collect and recycle waste, which 
can make EPR redundant. 
The oil and gas industry being a global industry, with producers operating in a variety of countries with 
different environmental regulations. This makes it difficult to implement a single EPR system that would 
be effective across all countries.

At OIL, identification of work-related hazards and assessment of risks is a critical element of our HSE 
Management system practices for ensuring a safe and healthy work environment. In this regard, several 
routine and non-routine processes have been put in place for identification of risks and hazards as detailed 
below:  
a) Hazard Identification: HAZOP (Hazard and Operability Study), Quality Risk Assessment (QRA) 
studies are carried out at installations at regular intervals to identify potential hazards and Risks. 
Based on the study, appropriate hazard/risk control measures are put in place for bring the risk to 
a ALARP (As Low As Reasonably Practicable) level.  
b) Job Safety Analysis (JSA): JSA are carried out at OIL to understand the risks associated with 
specific job tasks and implement appropriate control measures. 
c) Incident Reporting and Investigation: Reporting and investigating incidents, near misses, and 
accidents are crucial for identifying root causes and underlying hazards. This information helps in 
implementing preventive measures to mitigate future risks. 
d) Health and Safety Committees: OIL has multi-level HSE committees meetings carried out at 
regular intervals. At the Apex level the meetings are chaired by CMD, OIL. These meetings enables 
employees and management to collaborate in identifying hazards, assessing risks, and proposing 
solutions.  
e) Work Permits: For non-routine tasks or high-risk activities, work permits are issued. These permits 
include a risk assessment and ensure that appropriate safety procedures are followed before and 
during the task. 
f) 
Training and Awareness: Regular training sessions and awareness programs are imparted for equip 
employees about potential hazards and risks associated with their work. This helps in fostering a 
safety-conscious culture and empowers employees to identify and report hazards 
g) Review of HSE Data: Review of HSE data, like incident reports, and trend analyses, helps in 
identifying common hazards and potential risks that needs to be addressed. 
h) Regulatory Compliance: OIL ensures compliance with relevant HSE regulations of 
Statutory/Regulatory bodies like Oil Industry Safety Directorate (OISD), Directorate General of 
Mines Safety (DGMS), Factory Inspectorates of the respective State, Petroleum and Natural Gas 
Regulatory Board (PNGRB), Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organization (PESO), etc. which 
leads to reduction of risk in process safety. 
 
Further the Company’s conducts Mock Drill (Level 1/II/III) at regular intervals, with the objective of 
remaining preparedness for any Hazard Scenario. DMP/ERDMP/CDMP are regularly updated to cater to 
real time situations.

PRINCIPLE 4: BUSINESSES SHOULD RESPECT THE INTERESTS OF AND

ESSENTIAL INDICATORS 
 
1. Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity  
 
OIL, as a Central Public Sector Undertaking, is dedicated to being accountable to all its stakeholders and 
enabling their participation in identifying material topics and solutions. To identify its stakeholders, OIL 
employs various methods such as examining the stakeholders of its peers and competitors, utilizing internal 
sources, and analyzing the repetitive presence of stakeholders in its communication materials. 
 
When identifying, prioritizing, and engaging with its stakeholders, OIL considers several factors. These 
include the relevance of the stakeholder to OIL's operations, the impact of OIL's operations on the 
stakeholder, the power of the stakeholder to influence OIL, and the interest of the stakeholder in OIL. 
 
OIL engages with its stakeholders through both direct (for e.g., interviews, meetings, focus group 
discussions, surveys, etc.)  and indirect modes of engagement ( for e.g., monitor media, social media, and 
other public forums).Through these mediums, we also establish feedback loops to continuously improve 
engagement processes and address new or evolving stakeholder concerns. We believe that effective 
stakeholder engagement is essential to its success and the long-term sustainability of its operations. 
Given the extensive stakeholder network and interactions, achieving inclusivity can be a complex task. By 
utilizing its established processes, OIL has identified 11 key stakeholder groups, including the public at 
large. These groups are further classified into external and internal stakeholders. Internal stakeholders 
consist of all employees, while the key external stakeholders encompass the remaining 10 stakeholder group 
such as investors, community, regulatory bodies, etc.

LEADERSHIP INDICATORS 
 
1. Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, 
environmental, and social topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such 
consultations provided to the Board. 
 
Stakeholder consultations on ESG topics are usually conducted by respective spheres, department heads, 
and relevant company officers using various communication channels, including face-to-face meetings, 
surveys, and online forums. The feedback and identified areas of corporate concern are escalated to the 
Board level, either directly or through various Board Committees. The board integrates stakeholder 
feedback into the company’s strategic planning and decision-making processes and implements its action 
plans though these committees. The committees also do performance monitoring the action plans. 
 
2. Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of 
environmental, and social topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs 
received from stakeholders on these topics were incorporated into policies and activities of the entity.  
 
Yes. Stakeholder consultation is essential for identifying areas of improvement in corporate environmental 
and social efforts. OIL places high importance on understanding the needs and expectations of communities 
through a focused engagement process and communication strategy. This understanding is used to develop 
and implement outcome-based and impact-oriented projects in selected areas. 
  
Since OIL operates in remote and underdeveloped regions, engaging with external stakeholders, including 
the local communities, provides valuable insights into the needs of disadvantaged and vulnerable groups. In 
recent years, OIL has conducted baseline surveys and needs assessments in several of its operational areas 
to better understand community needs through structured interactions and feedback. 
  
Before granting environmental clearance for new exploration and production (E&P) activities, the State 
Pollution Control Board organizes a public hearing with the local community. An action plan based on 
 
42 
 
BRSR 2023-24 
public input is then submitted to the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) and 
implemented during the project. 
  
OIL also adheres to the Presidential Directives and guidelines issued by the Government of India on 
reservations in services for Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), Other Backward Classes (OBC), 
Persons with Disabilities (PWD), and Ex-servicemen to promote inclusive growth. 
 
3. Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of 
vulnerable/ marginalized stakeholder groups. 
 
OIL has undertaken various initiatives as part of its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) to support 
vulnerable and marginalized stakeholder groups. The details of these CSR activities can be found in the 
CSR section of the Annual Report. These initiatives encompass projects in Healthcare, Education, 
Sustainable Livelihoods, Skill Development, Capacity Building, Empowerment of Women and Persons 
with Disabilities, Drinking Water & Sanitation under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Promotion of Rural 
Sports, Development of Social Assets, Sustainable Environment, and Development of Aspirational 
Districts, among others. OIL has also procured goods and services from vendors belonging to the Scheduled 
Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) categories, as well as from women entrepreneurs, in line with the 
Public Procurement Policy of the Government of India. Additionally, OIL promotes employment 
opportunities for SC/ST/OBC/EWS classes, along with other vulnerable groups such as ex-servicemen and 
people with disabilities.

5. Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its 
coverage and implementation.  
 
Yes. 
OIL has implemented a robust Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) mechanism as part of our commitment to 
sustainable water management. Our ZLD initiative ensures that no liquid waste from our operations is 
discharged outside, thereby minimizing the impact on water bodies and promoting responsible waste 
management. 
 
To achieve Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD), we have installed and commissioned Produced Water Re-
Injection (PWRI) facilities through strategic capital investments. In recent years, we have proactively 
installed new high-capacity centralized Effluent Treatment Plants (ETPs), including modular units for 
remote locations. These ETPs utilize advanced technologies to effectively treat produced water, ensuring it 
meets the stringent quality standards of the Minimum National Standards (MINAS) for underground 
disposal in designated water disposal wells. This process safeguards the environment and minimizes our 
ecological footprint, contributing to responsible water management and conservation efforts. 
 
Additionally, OIL has established a desalination pilot plant at STF-Madhuban, which treats highly saline 
water (Total Dissolved Solids) to make it suitable for reuse in our operations. This initiative aligns with our 
zero liquid discharge philosophy, and we plan to scale up the unit and replicate it in other locations to 
optimize water usage and reduce our environmental footprint. Our commitment to sustainable water 
management and actions towards ZLD demonstrate our dedication to environmental stewardship and 
resource conservation. 
 
At OIL, our commitment to environmental stewardship drives us to continuously enhance our practices for 
the sustainable management of precious natural resources. The implementation of Zero Liquid Discharge is 
a crucial part of our efforts to create a greener and more sustainable future.

10. Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the 
strategy adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products 
and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes 
 
Oil India Limited (OIL) has implemented a comprehensive waste management system to ensure that all 
waste generated by its operations is disposed of in an environmentally sound manner. The following 
approach is adopted for managing hazardous and non-hazardous waste: 
 
 A. Hazardous Waste 
1. Oily Sludge: Oily sludge from storage tank bottoms at various installations in FHQ, Duliajan, is collected, 
transferred, and processed at OIL's Sludge Processing Plant. The crude oil recovered from the process is 
pumped to the nearest oil collecting station as recovered crude oil. The remaining sludge is bioremediated 
through contracts with registered and reputable organizations. Additionally, in-situ and ex-situ 
bioremediation are carried out at affected sites to handle emergencies involving oil spills on land and water 
bodies. 
2. Spent Oil: Used lubricant oil from various installations is collected and disposed of by registered 
recyclers for recycling or co-processing. 
3. Chemical sludge from wastewater treatment: In wastewater treatment facility, the chemical sludge 
produced during the treatment process is typically disposed of on-site in a pit lined with high-density 
polyethylene (HDPE) to prevent leaching into the surrounding soil. 
4. Oil soaked cotton rag : Contaminated cotton rag is incinerated or bioremediated.  
B. Non-Hazardous Waste 
1.Drill Cuttings: Drill cuttings, solid materials removed from the wellbore during drilling, are washed and 
stored in HDPE-lined pits at drill sites. Additionally, under Project Bhuvan Mitra, OIL has introduced a 
Vertical Cutting Dryer (VCD) system for the treatment of drill cuttings. This system uses centrifugal force 
to separate drill cuttings from the drill fluid, eliminating wastewater generation and allowing the recovery 
and recycling of drill fluid back into drilling operations. 
2. E-Waste: E-waste, generated from electronic and electrical equipment such as computers, televisions, 
and cell phones, is disposed of through an approved recycler agency. 
3. Battery : Battery waste is disposed of through registered recyclers. 
 
57 
 
BRSR 2023-24 
4. Bio-Medical Waste: Bio-medical waste, generated from healthcare facilities, includes items such as 
needles, swabs, and bandages. OIL disposes of bio-medical waste through a double-chamber incinerator.

to recognize potential impacts and devise mitigation strategies. OIL has formulated an Environment 
Management Plan (EMP) detailing specific actions to minimize these impacts. Furthermore, OIL complies 
with all conditions set forth in Environmental Clearance. These concerted efforts have resulted in minimal 
impact on biodiversity from OIL's operations. 
  
OIL remains dedicated to reducing its environmental impact and continually enhancing its environmental 
performance. 
 
 
4. If the entity has undertaken any specific initiatives or used innovative technology or solutions to

S. 
No 
Initiative

Details of the initiative (Web-link, if any, may be 
provided along-with summary) 
Outcome of the 
initiative 
 1 
Bhuvan Mitra 
Under the project Bhuvan Mitra, Oil India Limited 
(OIL) has taken a pioneering step towards waste 
management and reduction through the installation of 
a drilling cutting treatment unit. This innovative 
initiative aims to address the challenges associated 
with the generation and disposal of drilling waste, 
while demonstrating a proactive approach to 
environmental protection. One of the primary 
problems faced was the generation of a significant 
amount of wastewater and the wastage of drilling fluid, 
which 
posed 
handling 
and 
disposal 
issues. 
Additionally, the requirement of land for waste 
collection pits further compounded the challenges.  
This 
system 
utilizes centrifugal 
force to separate 
the drill cuttings 
from the drill fluid, 
eliminating 
the 
generation 
of 
wastewater 
and 
allowing for the 
recovery 
and 
recycling of the 
drill fluid back into 
the 
drilling 
operations. 
 2 
Recovery 
of 
hydrocarbon 
from oily waste 
Oil India Limited has introduced a set up a treatment 
plant to recover valuable hydrocarbon from oily waste 
such as tank bottom sludge and spilled crude oil. This 
initiative eliminates the need to dispose of oily waste 
in landfills or incinerators, which can be harmful to the 
environment.  
The 
overall 
recovery from the 
plant is 40% to 
45%, and in 2022, 
the plant recovered 
1400 KL of crude 
oil. This represents 
a 
significant 
reduction in the 
environmental 
impact 
of 
oily 
waste, and it also 
provides a valuable 
source of revenue 
for the plant. 
 3 
Installation 
of 
Central ETPs 
Oil India Limited has installed two Central ETPs 
(Effluent Treatment Plants) with a capacity of 7200 
This 
helps 
to 
reduce the amount

BRSR 2023-24 
KLD and 5000 KLD to treat formation water produced 
during oil and gas production activities. The formation 
water generated during oil and gas separation process 
are treated through Central ETP’s to remain within 
permissible limits of treated effluent quality as per 
Minimum National Standards (MINAS) and then 
reinjected into injection wells.  
of wastewater that 
needs 
to 
be 
disposed of, and it 
also reduces the 
amount 
of 
groundwater 
that 
needs 
to 
be 
consumed. 
 4 
Gas 
Blending 
System 
In order to reduce dependency on diesel and aim for 
lower emissions, a pilot project of Dynamic Gas 
Blending (DGB) system has been implemented in the 
powerpacks of the S#7 Drilling Rig of OIL at the MGS 
(Lakwa Gaon) site on March 5th, 2024. The system 
enables diesel engines to run on either diesel fuel alone 
or a combination of diesel and natural gas, thus 
diminishing 
the 
environmental 
footprint 
and 
operational expenses while maintaining the engine's 
performance characteristics. 
Reduction in diesel 
consumption 
resulting 
in 
emission reduction  
 
5. Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan? Give details in 100 words/

ESSENTIAL INDICATORS 
 
1. Describe the mechanisms in place to receive and respond to consumer complaints and feedback.  
Oil India Limited (OIL) has established a built-in mechanism for stakeholder grievance redressal in its Crude 
Oil Sales Agreement and Gas Supply Agreement. OIL sells crude oil to refineries and natural gas to gas utility 
companies, and supplies LPG, both in packed and bulk form, to Indian Oil Corporation Limited. Feedback is 
collected based on specific qualitative and quantitative parameters, which helps identify areas for 
improvement. 
 
For instance, OIL conducts daily quality checks of crude oil at the point of sale. The integrity of pipelines is 
regularly inspected using standard pipeline inspection methods and monitored through the existing SCADA 
and LDS systems. In the case of natural gas, supply to consumers is monitored daily to ensure the delivery of 
the committed quantity, quality, and pressure of gas as per the terms and conditions of the agreement. 
Additionally, a joint reconciliation of gas with customers is carried out every month and recorded. Any 
discrepancies, complaints, or suggestions are discussed in the monthly meetings. OIL is committed to

We have established a Cybersecurity Operations Centre (CSOC) to monitor all the End Point Detection & 
Response (EDR) for all servers/desktops/ laptops connected to OIL's network. EDR solution monitors every 
endpoint in real time round the clock for any suspicious/malicious activities and raises necessary alert 
messages accordingly. This centralized approach allows security policies to be efficiently pushed to the 
onboarded devices from a single portal, enhancing manageability and providing greater security related 
control capabilities to administrators. 
Additionally, security controls pertaining to user access & identity management, network & data center 
architecture were reviewed & improved based on recommendations of a reputed international security 
agency.

Stakeholder Engagement and Materiality Assessment   
 
Stakeholder Engagement (GRI 2-29) 
To improve our value proposition and meet the expectations of those involved, we at OIL understand the importance 
of maintaining our social license to operate. This is accomplished by regularly engaging with our stakeholders to gain 
a better understanding of their perspectives and needs and developing strategies that align with their expectations. Our 
stakeholders consist of individuals and organizations who are affected by our operations and resources and therefore 
have a significant influence on how we conduct our business. By collaborating with our stakeholders, we can enhance 
our products and processes, involve them in decision-making, and establish trust.  
We actively seek to understand the concerns of our stakeholders by directly consulting with them, taking into 
consideration potential barriers such as language, cultural differences, gender and power imbalances, and divisions 
within the community. Throughout the year, we interact with various stakeholders, including employees, government 
and regulatory bodies, suppliers, customers, industry partners, communities, non-governmental organizations 
(NGOs), and contractors. These stakeholders were identified through our sustainability and annual reports, as well as 
those of our peers and competitors, and were categorized into 12 key groups, encompassing both internal and external 
stakeholders. 
We uphold the human rights of all stakeholders and individuals that we engage with, including their rights to privacy, 
freedom of expression, peaceful assembly, and protest. We take measures to protect them from any form of retaliation 
for raising complaints or concerns.

Materiality Assessment (GRI 3-1) 
In FY 2022-23, we undertook a materiality assessment guided by the GRI Standards 2021. OIL acknowledges that 
stakeholders may have varying levels of importance for different ESG issues. As a result, OIL categorizes ESG topics 
as high, medium, or low based on their significance to both internal and external stakeholders. This matrix of 
materiality guides strategic decision-making, mitigates operational risks, and determines priority areas for intervention 
by OIL. We have considered the views of stakeholders (Mentioned in table 2) and subject matter experts from different 
business domain within our organization,  to finalize the material topics and associated impacts.  
We undertook the materiality assessment in 4 steps: 
1. Determining OIL’s organizational context: In this stage, a desk review was conducted to evaluate the business 
operations, the business relationships, and the manner in which the business interacts with its immediate 
environment. A sustainability context was established by examining the economic, ecological, human rights and 
other societal issues at local, provincial, and global levels throughout the value chain. A high-level initial overview 
of the activities and business relations, the sustainability framework in which these are occurring, and an outline of 
its stakeholders was established. This provided essential information for determining its real and potential effects. 
The activities, business relations, stakeholders and sustainability framework of all entities that the business controls 
or has an interest in, including minority interests, were also considered. 
2. Identify actual and potential impacts: In this step, we took guidance from the GRI Oil & Gas Sector Standards to 
determine our impacts on the economy, environment, and people, including impacts on their human rights, across 
our activities and business relationships. Additionally, we conducted secondary research to determine the actual and 
 
 
73 
 
BRSR 2023-24 
potential impacts of our business and operations. Actual impacts are those that have already occurred, and potential 
impacts are those that could occur but have not yet occurred. The elements of impacts considered as intended and 
unintended.  
3. Quantify impact: In this step, the insights gained from the stakeholder consultation were used to identify the 
importance of the impacts outlined in the preceding step. Numerous actual and potential impacts were identified. 
The importance of the impacts was then evaluated and prioritized. Prioritization allows for action to be taken on the 
impacts and the material topics for reporting to be identified. Prioritization of impacts for action is pertinent where 
it is relevant. 
The severity of the impacts is determined by their scope, scale and irremediable nature. The probability of the impact 
is based on the likelihood of its occurrence. The impact of the issues on human rights were also evaluated. In the 
event of potential adverse human rights impacts, their severity takes precedence over their likelihood. 
4. Prioritizing material topics:  In this step, we grouped our impacts under umbrella topics and prioritized them based 
on the quantitative analysis conducted in the previous step. Subsequently, we arrived at the list of material topics 
for reporting. The significance of an impact is assessed in relation to the other impacts that we have identified. Then, 
we arranged the impacts from most to least significant and define a cut-off point or threshold to determine which of 
the impacts it will focus its reporting on.
