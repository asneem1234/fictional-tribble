PRINCIPLE 4: Businesses should respect the interests of and be responsive to all its stakeholders
Essential indicators
1.	
Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity
	
The Company adopts a systematic approach to identify key stakeholder groups vital for its operations. Initially, the Company 
consults extensively with its management team, following these steps:
	
i)	
Compiling a comprehensive list of stakeholders.
	
ii)	
Categorising stakeholders into internal and external groups.
	
iii)	
Prioritising stakeholder groups based on their significance to the Company’s operations and objectives.
	
These primary stakeholders encompass consumers (both B2B and B2C), employees, shareholders/ investors, suppliers, 
the community, governments/ regulators.
	
Moreover, the Company extends its stakeholder identification beyond primary groups through an in-depth analysis of its 
business environment, considering factors such as industry dynamics, market trends, and regulatory requirements. Through 
this process, the Company identifies other stakeholders closely linked to its operations, such as industry analysts, equity 
analysts, and the news media, serving as proxies for customers, shareholders, and society at large.
	
Additionally, the Company has established organisation-wide processes to facilitate open and constructive dialogue with 
stakeholders regularly. Engaging in such communication channels enhances the Company’s understanding of relevant 
issues and helps recognise the unique attributes of stakeholders contributing value. The Company consistently aims to 
understand their needs, expectations, and interests to improve business outcomes.
	
Furthermore, the Company’s stakeholder engagement strategy prioritises two-way communication, enabling the integration 
of diverse perspectives into business practices effectively. This approach ensures that stakeholders feel valued and heard, 
fostering mutual benefits and sustainable relationships.
