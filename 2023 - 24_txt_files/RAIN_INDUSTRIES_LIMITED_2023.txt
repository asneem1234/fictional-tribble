Details of improvements in environmental and social impacts
Larger scale samples of the newly developed NOVARES® MP 50/LM liquid 
hydrocarbon resin product family were supplied as a part of the marketing 
plan to customers in the coatings industry as possible substitutes of the 
NOVARES® LS and LA liquid hydrocarbon resin products which have been 
under scrutiny by the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) as potential 
substances of very high concern which could lead to a ban of such 
products. The NOVARES® MP50/LM liquid hydrocarbon resin product family 
has been developed in the last couple of years to prepare such a scenario.
The NOVARES® Pure 2090 hydrogenated hydrocarbon resin could be 
developed as a color-less, odor-less, and non-toxic resin product and could 
be homologated in the cosmetic industry where it is mainly applied in 
depilatories.
The newly introduced feed cooling in the manufacturing process of 
NOVARES® TM 85 AS water-white and odor-free pure monomer resin 
not only improved the product quality and batch consistency but also the 
process yields by 5 %. In addition, with the new feed cooling less out-of-
spec product batches are produced during the start-up phase of each 
process campaign.
The recycling of xylene used as a process solvent in the production of 
NOVARES® TM pure monomer resin was developed during 2023 and will 
be introduced in the industrial production process of these water-white, 
odor-free, and non-toxic pure monomer resins from the first quarter 2024. 
The recycled xylene will be re-used in the process which will improve the 
economics of the pure monomer resin manufacturing process as well as its 
sustainability.
Savings in waste-water volumes achieved by adjustments of the manufacturing 
process of the NOVARES® LA products have increased the sustainability of this 
liquid resin product family used in the coatings industry.
The recycling of phenol, that could be introduced in the manufacture of 
NOVARES® LS products, helps to avoid phenol-containing waste during the 
production of these products and by this improving their ecological and 
economical sustainability.
Substantial yield improvement at the same raw material use and energy 
expenditure could be achieved in the manufacturing process of the 
petroleum-based NOVARES® Y-TC 10 indene-based hydrocarbon resin 
leading to an improved economics and sustainability of the product mainly 
applied as additive in the rubber industry.
NOVARES® Pure 2100 hydrogenated hydrocarbon resin can reduce, if used 
as a tackifier in the tire threads, the rolling resistance of car tires and by that 
improves the fuel consumption of internal combustion engine cars or the 
energy consumption/driving range of electric vehicles.
NOVARES® L 100 could be homologated as a plasticizer substituting the 
traditional phthalate plasticizers being banned for ecological reasons in 
liquid polyurethane adhesives.
The quality of the PETRORES® and LIONCOAT® product lines that are used 
as thermoplastic carbon precursors in the manufacturing of carbonaceous 
battery anode material for lithium-ion batteries for consumer electronics, 
electric vehicles, and battery energy storage could be further improved. A big 
progress was hereby achieved in product purity and content of metal particles 
affecting the safety of the lithium-ion battery cells. Several purification and pre-
processing steps that have been introduced in the manufacture process chain 
of these carbon precursors could not only improve quality but at the same time 
broadened the availability of usable raw material by-product streams that are up 
cycled to obtain the desired products.

Projects with sustainability impact in this business segment are mainly

a.	
Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)
	
	
Rain Carbon Inc.:
	
	
Supply chain sustainability is managed differently and individually at each legal entity. Procedures are in place that 
require full check of whether a new purchased product fulfils all environmental and safety requirements, including 
risk analysis and regulatory compliance check. In general, we aim for further harmonizing our approach to do supplier 
assessments according to national and global regulations. Specific measures include the following:
	
	
U.S.:
•	
A Supplier Code of Conduct was established in 2023 for our US business.
•	
Prior to becoming an approved supplier, each company must complete and sign a Master Service 
Agreement (MSA) and obtain an approved rating in ISNetworld
	
	
Germany
•	
Once a year the performance of selected suppliers is assessed. The assessment, amongst others, includes 
whether an environmental or energy management system is implemented.
•	
Terms and conditions define certain requirements for suppliers including payment of minimum wages.
	
b.	
If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?
	
	
A respective KPI is not monitored for RCI, RCL and RIL. However, a systematic and standardized approach is 
under review. Once implemented respective KPIs will be available.
3.	
Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of life, 
for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.
	
The Subsidiary Companies in India and US are engaged in the business of manufacture and sale of Cement (India) 
and Calcined Petroleum Coke (India and US). In the process of manufacture of Cement and Calcined Petroleum 
Coke, plants generate electricity through waste heat recovery-based power plants which converts the waste heat 
generated into electricity. In the manufacture of Cement, there is no solid or liquid waste arising from this process. For 
distillation and calcination, a major part of our products are intermediates and are converted into CO2. Thus, there are 
no end-consumer products that can be reclaimed.
	
The US facilities take part in a universal waste disposal program to eliminate waste in a facility designated for this 
product for treatment. The US facilities are also working with authorities to dispose of secondary products for 
beneficial use, as well as for agricultural use.
 4. 	 Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes / No):
	
Yes

certification. Recently, we have appointed a Group Chief Medical Officer in corporate office, in order to strengthen 
the medical and wellness campaign throughout the organization. Additionally, we recently conducted a few medical 
camps in our cement units, and we have also tied up with Apollo health clinic for annual medical check up of our 
employees at Carbon units.

What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by 
the entity?
	
Our focus includes our Life‑Saving Rules campaign, site audits, leadership walkthroughs, and near misses and 
unsafe conditions/unsafe acts program, and the need for increased safety related communication at all levels of our 
organization. We also emphasize training to raise awareness about routine and non-routine hazards during, daily working 
conditions, process changes, project construction and start-ups, and planned shutdowns for repairs and maintenance. 
We regularly conduct toolbox talks, as part of our safety procedures and before taking up of any new assignments in 
order to orient safety requirements for the job and precautions to be taken during the course of the said job.
	
We continuously strive for better safety work standards and to ensure zero incidents. Hence, we continuously work 
upon areas of improvement in order to have a safer workplace. These areas for improvement are a top priority 
throughout RAIN and they enables us to make important progress on our ‘Quest for Zero’ journey.
	
The Board of Directors evaluates the framework, focusing on discussions regarding management submissions 
on risks, identifying crucial risks and approving relevant action plans to mitigate such risks based on priority. 
The responsibility of assisting the Risk Management Committee on an independent basis lies with the internal 
audit function armed with the complete status of risk assessments and management. Other activities of the Risk 
Management Committee include obtaining frequent updates on certain identified risks depending on the nature, 
significance and possible impact on the business.

15.	 Provide details of any corrective action taken or underway to address safety-related incidents (if any) and on 
significant risks/concerns arising from assessments of health & safety practices and working conditions.
	
Prevention of safety-related incidents is one of our highest priorities. We have an extensive safety programme, 
which includes formal training for all employees, preventive measures such as pre-job safety analyses and a system 
aimed at identifying risks, taking corrective actions and preventing incidents. We regularly conduct internal audits of 
this safety system. We also conduct regular toolbox talks to create awareness of safety requirements related to our 
activities. Our management team has implemented a structured process for handling, monitoring, documenting and 
learning from near-miss accidents. We have taken stringent measures to reduce the number of recordable incidents 
Company-wide and the monetary incentives of most employees are linked to fulfilling the Company’s safety targets.
	
After auditing sites or investigating incidents, multiple corrective actions could be implemented. We use the hierarchy 
of controls system to first eliminate the hazard, if possible, and then work down to the PPE level. It is not uncommon 
for two or more hierarchy levels to be implemented for one incident or hazard identification. Each corrective action is 
recorded along with the hazard or incident and then communicated to all sites for further implementation, to correct 
similar hazards at other sites.
	
As part of quality initiatives, the KAIZEN and the Quality circle introduction would also further cover the importance of 
the safety standards for bringing better efficiency and productivity in the system.

10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by 
your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices 
adopted to manage such wastes.
	
RCI: Our production processes aim at highest resource efficiency in converting as much raw materials as possible into 
products and thus, minimising waste volumes. We implemented multiple activities across our global operations that 
are described in the non-statutory section of this report.
	
All of our facilities go through a chemical approval process to reduce/eliminate employee exposure to hazardous 
chemicals while reducing or eliminating environmental concerns. The process identifies chemicals reviewed and 
approved by the responsible BU official and his/her designees.
	
In our calcination facilities for example, a chemical approval form will be completed by the site and submitted to the 
S&H Manager, North America for approval. You must give how the chemical will be used and whether or not it will 
replace an existing chemical. An SDS must also be provided listing any hazards associated with the chemical.
	
RCL: Household waste collection, segregation and disposal/ use as compost/ incinerated in kiln is being done at RCL 
since past 2 years from every house. Not many waste products are there in cement, limestone mining generates some 
waste such as oil/ fuel.
