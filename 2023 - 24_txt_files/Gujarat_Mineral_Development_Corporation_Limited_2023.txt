Leadership Indicators
1. Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and social topics or if 
consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board. 
 
In our organisation, we recognise the importance of stakeholder engagement and consultation on economic, environmental, and 
social topics. Firstly, we actively engage with stakeholders through various channels such as surveys, focus groups, public meetings, 
and one-on-one interactions. These engagements allow us to gather diverse perspectives, concerns, and suggestions from 
stakeholders including employees, customers, suppliers, local communities, and advocacy groups. In cases where consultation is 
delegated to speciﬁc departments or individuals, a structured framework is in place to capture feedback from these consultations. 
This includes periodic reporting mechanisms that summarise the outcomes, key insights, and recommendations from stakeholder 
consultations. The summarised information is then shared with the management, ensuring that they are informed about the 
perspectives and concerns raised by stakeholders. By fostering meaningful consultation and feedback mechanisms, we aim to 
ensure that stakeholder perspectives are considered in our decision-making processes. This approach enables us to address 
economic, environmental, and social topics more eﬀectively, promoting transparency, accountability, and sustainable practices 
throughout our operations.
2. Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identiﬁcation and management of environmental, and social topics (Yes 
/ No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these topics were incorporated into 
policies and activities of the entity.

Collector of the District where the Project is located. The concerns raised by the stakeholders are noted and appropriate actions are 
taken by the company to comply with the concerns and a detailed report is submitted with the competent regulatory authority on 
regular intervals.

10. Brieﬂy describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your 
company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to 
manage such wastes.
 
Waste Management Practices - Major solid waste arising out of the mining operations is Over Burden (OB). Management of OB is done 
by proper dumping of OB material in earmarked sites and later used for backﬁlling and biological reclamations of mines; ﬂy ash 
generated from the power plants is also being utilised in backﬁlling of mined out areas.
 
Hazardous waste disposal –
(1) Waste oil/Used oil: Used oil is disposed of through registered/authorised recyclers/MSTC
(2) Bio-medical Waste: Disposed of through authorised agencies
(3) E-waste: Centrally collected for disposal to authorised vendors
(4) Battery Waste Disposal: Used batteries are disposed of through buyback mechanism

Reverse Osmosis (RO) plant has been installed with 250 
KLD permeate water capacity, very unique type of 
automatic and advance technology within a container to 
treat the mine water after initial treatment in the existing 
ETP.
RO treated water is being used in 
domestic use, plantation/greenbelt 
development, thus conserving the water 
resource by eﬃcient reuse.
Primary ETP

Primary Eﬄuent Treatment Plant (ETP) has been installed 
having total capacity 130 Kl/Hr at 3 lignite projects for 
treatment of mine pit water and afterwards eﬃcient reuse 
of the same. 
At present 413.83 ha potential biologically, reclaimed area 
has been covered by massive plantation and using seed 
ball.
Around 37,94,408 Kl water was 
neutralised during FY 2023-24 & 
neutralised water is being used for 
sprinkling to mine haul roads for dust 
suppression, by this fresh groundwater 
consumption has been reduced and 
conserved the water by eﬃcient reuse 
of treated water.
Soil stabilisation, improved soil quality,
