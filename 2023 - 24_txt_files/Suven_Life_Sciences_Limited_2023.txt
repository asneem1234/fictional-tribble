Clinical

Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: 
Engaging in clinical trials poses a 
significant financial risk for Suven, 
as it necessitates substantial 
investment important for advancing 
new treatments or medications. The 
inherent uncertainties in research along 
with the extended duration of trials 
increase the likelihood of setbacks, 
such as trial failures or unforeseen 
circumstances. These can result in 
financial losses, delays in market entry, 
damage to reputation, legal liabilities, 
and missed revenue opportunities.
Suven aims to conduct a 
thorough risk assessment 
at the beginning of each 
trial to identify hazards 
across the study, forming 
a skilled investigative 
team and employing 
various patient 
recruitment methods 
ensure timely enrolment 
and adherence to 
the protocol. Vigilant 
monitoring, combined 
with strict data

Negative
Opportunity:
Successful clinical trials are essential 
within the pharmaceutical sector, 
confirming the effectiveness and 
safety of drug, building trust among 
professionals, regulators, and patients. 
They streamline regulatory approval 
and product commercialization, which 
thereby boosts market value, drawing in 
investors, and help stock appreciation. 
Further, Positive outcomes can initiate 
successful launch of the product and 
marketing.

preserve trial integrity. 
The post-trial evaluations 
promote in learning and 
improvement, leading 
to the identification of 
best practices for future 
trials. These strategies 
collectively enhance trial

2.
Drug 
Safety 
Monitoring
Risk
The occurrence of adverse events, 
safety recalls, or controversies regarding 
medication safety poses a significant 
risk to the company. Such incidents 
can lead to erosion of public trust, 
triggering regulatory scrutiny, and 
potential litigation, thereby impacting 
the company’s financial performance 
and reputation. When medications 
are linked to adverse events or safety 
concerns, it not only puts patient well-
being at risk but also undermines the 
confidence of healthcare professionals 
and consumers in the company’s 
ability to provide safe and effective 
treatments. Consequently, this loss 
of trust may prompt regulatory 
agencies to launch investigations into 
the medication’s safety and efficacy, 
potentially resulting in actions such as 
product recalls, label modifications, or 
even market withdrawal.
As a measure to 
mitigate, every clinical 
development program 
has safety monitoring 
group involved in 
reporting any safety 
alerts or issues that are 
surfaced during the 
clinical trials and reported 
to regulatory agencies 
as per the protocol. 
During the phase 2 and 
phase 3 clinical trial 
programs Suven engage 
independent safety 
monitoring committee 
and setup independent 
Data Safety Monitoring 
Board (DSMB). DSMB role 
is to oversee the adverse 
events including serious 
adverse events, if any, 
during the conduct of 
clinical trials and periodic 
reporting of the same to 
regulatory agencies.

3.
Human 
Capital
Opportunity A skilled workforce, including 
researchers, scientists, and medical 
professionals, can drive innovation 
in drug discovery and development. 
Their expertise in fields such as 
pharmacology, biochemistry, and 
medicine empowers the company to 
address complex scientific challenges 
and create innovative solutions . As the 
drug development process encounters 
many scientific hurdles, a skilled team 
with strong problem-solving abilities 
can swiftly identify challenges, devise 
creative solutions, and navigate 
obstacles. This capability accelerates 
the R&D process and enhances the 
company’s ability to bring new drugs to 
market.
