Financial implications

1
Sustainable 
packaging
Opportunity
The Company prioritises 
environmental stewardship 
by utilising recyclable 
materials or renewable 
resources, such as recycled 
paper to reduce reliance 
on single-use plastics 
and mitigate waste 
and pollution. Through 
value engineering and 
sustainable packaging 
solutions, the Company 
minimises its ecological 
footprint.
-
Positive Implication
Sustainable packaging 
offers a dual advantage, 
its lighter weight reduces 
shipping and handling 
costs, while its ease of 
disposal involves lower 
labour and material 
costs.
2
Waste 
management
Risk
Improper waste disposal 
management practices 
can have devastating 
environmental 
consequences, including 
pollution, habitat 
destruction and the 
depletion of natural 
resources, prompting 
authorities to enact 
strict regulations. Non-
compliance can lead to 
legal ramifications, fines 
and potential damage to 
the Company’s reputation.
Adopting sustainable 
waste management 
practices, such as 
recycling, waste reduction 
and responsible disposal 
methods, is essential to 
minimise the Company’s 
ecological footprint. By 
implementing robust 
waste management 
systems and collaborating 
with certified waste 
management partners, 
the Company can 
mitigate regulatory 
risks and ensure proper 
disposal, safeguarding 
the environment and its 
reputation.
Negative Implication
Waste management has 
a profound impact on 
the Company’s standing, 
with direct consequences 
stemming from the 
principle of 3 Rs (reduce, 
reuse, and recycle), 
potentially leading to 
increased purchasing 
expenses.
3
Sustainable 
farming and 
RM sourcing
Opportunity
 Sustainable farming 
methods, including 
organic farming, agro-
forestry and regenerative 
agriculture, enhance 
soil health, biodiversity 
and water conservation. 
Incorporating these 
practices into the supply 
chain enhances the 
Company’s resilience. By 
partnering with like-
minded farmers and 
suppliers, the Company 
cultivates long-term 
relationships, securing 
a stable supply of raw 
materials.
Positive Implication 
Sustainable farming 
and raw material 
sourcing is imperative 
for the Company as it 
reduces risks, boosts 
efficiency and resilience 
as well as enhances 
reputation, ultimately 
contributing to the 
Company’s long-term 
success. By adopting 
sustainable practices, the 
Company also addresses 
environmental and social 
concerns.

4
Climate 
change
Risk
Extreme weather events 
like hurricanes, floods 
and droughts pose a 
significant threat to 
supply chain continuity, 
disrupting the production 
and distribution of raw 
materials and finished 
goods. Meanwhile, 
governments and 
regulatory bodies are 
tightening climate change 
regulations and targets.
The Company is 
committed to embracing 
sustainable practices, 
focusing on reducing 
greenhouse gas 
emissions, transitioning 
to renewable energy and  
implementing  carbon 
footprint reduction 
strategies. 
The Company 
meticulously monitors 
climatic changes and 
rigorously oversees 
environmental policy 
implementation, 
making adjustments as 
needed. Additionally, the 
Company is expanding 
its product portfolio 
by introducing new 
food products and a 
broader variety of rice-
based offerings, while 
also diversifying its 
procurement base.
Negative Implication 
It has the potential to 
disrupt the continuity of 
business operations.
5
Water 
management
Risk
Water scarcity poses 
a significant threat to 
agricultural supply chains 
as it can disrupt the 
availability and quality of 
water.
The Company is 
committed to responsible 
water management, 
employing advanced 
techniques to 
optimise usage. This 
is achieved through 
the implementation of 
innovative reuse and 
recycling protocols 
via Sewage Treatment 
Plants (STP) and Effluent 
Treatment Plants (ETP), 
as well as sustainable 
agricultural practices like 
Alternate Wetting and 
Drying (AWD) and land 
laser levelling to conserve 
water and enhance crop 
yield.
Negative Implication
Water-related risks, 
such as floods or 
water shortages, can 
lead to production 
downtime and decreased 
productivity, impacting 
revenue and profitability.
6
Health and 
safety
Risk
Poor machinery and 
material handling practices 
can endanger employees, 
leading to injuries, legal 
issues, higher workers’ 
compensation costs and 
reputational damage.
Proactively implementing 
stringent safety measures 
and prioritising health 
and safety.
Positive Implication
Any investment towards 
employee health and 
safety will yield positive 
results in the long-term.

Human rights
Opportunity
Prioritising human rights 
and ethical practices can 
enhance the Company’s 
brand reputation, build 
consumer trust and foster 
loyalty.
Negative Implication 
Any violation can lead 
to severe reputational 
and financial risk for the 
organisation.
8
Diversity and 
inclusion
Opportunity
Promoting a diverse 
and inclusive work 
environment enhances 
employee engagement 
and retention.
Positive Implication  
Making diversity and 
inclusion a priority will 
lead to improved overall 
employee and business 
performance.
9
Training and 
development
Opportunity
 Developing a highly-
skilled and adaptable 
workforce enables the 
Company to respond 
effectively to changing 
market demands, innovate 
and stay ahead of the 
competition.
Positive Implication 
Equipped with diverse 
skills, employees can be 
more productive in their 
roles and contribute to 
the Company’s success.
10
Product 
quality and 
safety
Risk
Failure to meet safety 
standards and regulations 
can have severe 
consequences related 
to consumer health. 
Contaminated products, 
inaccurate labelling, or 
undisclosed allergens can 
lead to consumer illnesses, 
product recalls, legal 
actions, and reputational 
damage.
The Company has 
established rigorous 
internal quality and safety 
parameters, which will be 
meticulously monitored 
by dedicated quality 
teams. State-of-the-
art, tech-driven quality 
laboratories have been 
implemented. To mitigate 
unforeseen risks, the 
Company’s production 
setup undergoes regular 
quality and safety 
compliance reviews.
Negative Implication 
Product quality and 
safety has a direct 
impact on the Company’s 
reputation and sales so 
it is critically monitored 
and addressed for 
avoiding non-compliance 
and financial losses. 
However, enhanced 
consumer experiences 
can accelerate the 
Company’s growth 
trajectory.
11
Responsible 
Marketing and 
Advertising
Opportunity
Responsible marketing 
and advertising enable 
the Company to effectively 
reach and engage with eco 
conscious consumers.
Positive Implication 
Responsible marketing 
and advertising can 
foster long-term 
customer loyalty.
12

words/ web link.
	
LT Foods has implemented a robust risk management 
policy, which includes a comprehensive business 
continuity and disaster management strategy 
to diminish the impact of natural disasters and 
supply shortages.
	
In the event of a natural disaster affecting one facility, 
the Company has contingency plans to swiftly assess 
the situation, activate alternative production sites 
and adjust supply chains accordingly. This enables 
LT Foods to quickly respond, minimise potential 
operational disruptions and ensure continued 
availability of products.
	
LT 
Foods’ 
multi-location 
operations 
reduce 
dependence on a single facility. This diversification 
allows the Company to tap into alternative supply 
sources, ensuring uninterrupted customer service 
despite localised disruptions.
	
Furthermore, LT Foods maintains strong supplier 
relationships, 
ensuring 
seamless 
coordination 
and communication during times of crisis. This 
collaboration ensures a proactive response to supply 
shortages and identifying alternative sourcing 
options to maintain consistent product availability.

Policy on its website.

ensuring environmental responsibility throughout 
its operations and supply chain. In alignment 
with the Company’s Code of Conduct for Vendors 
and Service Providers, all suppliers are required 
to adhere to strict environmental standards 
and comply with relevant laws and regulations. 
 
To further mitigate potential environmental impacts, 
the Company has implemented Sustainable Rice 
Production (SRP) methods and actively educates 
farmers 
on 
sustainable 
agricultural 
practices. 
These efforts help to manage and minimise any
