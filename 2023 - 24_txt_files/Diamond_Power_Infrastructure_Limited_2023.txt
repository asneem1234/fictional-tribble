Do you have a focal point (Individual/ Committee) responsible for addressing human rights impactsor
issues caused or contributed to by the business? (Yes/No)
Yes, the Company has a comprehensive process and grievance redressal mechanism for human rights
outlined in its Human Rights Policy. Grievances are reviewed by the Compliance Officer and then presented
to the Board for disciplinary action.
Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues.
DICABS has established a clear internal mechanism to address human rights grievances efficiently under our ‘Human
Rights Policy’, openly available to all stakeholders, and applicable to all employees, directors, and officers. This policy
addresses a wide range of issues including sexual harassment, misuse of authority, human trafficking, workplace
safety, dignity, child and forced labour, equality, anti-bullying, and harassment. DICABS believes in taking feedback
from its stakeholders and also has a redressal mechanism for dealing with the grievances. The feedback and
grievances reported by the employees and stakeholders are confidential and secure. Employees can report issues
confidentially in writing or via mail, along with supporting documents, and the names and addresses of the witnesses,
to any member of the Internal Committee in writing with the Aggrieved Woman’s signature, within 3 months of
occurrence of the incident of Sexual Harassment. Additionally, DICABS has set up robust policies such as the Whistle
Blower Policy and the Sexual Harassment Redressal Policy to provide secure ways for stakeholders to express
grievances at any time where complaints are handled by the Audit Committee of the Board.

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases.
Your Company has a “Prevention of Sexual Harassment at Workplace (POSH) Policy” in place. The Company
has constituted Internal Committee (IC) under Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention,
Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013. Under the POSH Policy, IC has an obligation to ensure that a person
who lodges a complaint in good faith and without malice is protected and will not allow a person raising a
concern to be victimized for doing so. Unfortunately, despite the best precautions, the complainant would be
victimized; the IC will treat this as a serious offense and take disciplinary action against the perpetrator. The
Company is committed to handle matters regarding sexual harassment with sensitivity and confidentiality
will be maintained throughout the redressal process.
Do human rights requirements form part of your business agreements and contracts?  (Yes/No)

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy
adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and
processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
Non-Hazardous Waste: Non-hazardous waste refers to solid or semi-solid materials that do not pose a risk
to human health, agriculture, or the environment when disposed of properly. This type of waste does not
have harmful physical, chemical, reactive, toxic, flammable, explosive, or corrosive characteristics.
Hazardous Waste: Hazardous waste is any waste that, due to its physical, chemical, reactive, toxic,
flammable, explosive, or corrosive properties, poses a danger to health or the environment. This danger can
arise whether the waste is handled alone or in combination with other substances.
Domestic Waste (Garbage):
Collection: Waste bins with lids will be provided in all offices and plant areas for collecting waste. These
bins will be lined with plastic bags, and the collected waste will be transported to the designated
collection area (Waste Yard).
Disposal Method: Papers and plastics collected will be sent to an authorized recycler.
Food Waste: Food waste from the canteen will be collected in plastic bins with lids, lined with black
plastic bags, and stored in a designated collection area. These bins will be cleaned thoroughly on a daily
basis by the catering agency.
Disposal Method: The catering agency will handle the disposal of food waste.
Storage and Disposal of Hazardous Waste:
Storage: All hazardous waste, including waste oil, lubricants, oil sludge, oil filters, etc., that cannot be
neutralized, reused, or recycled, will be stored in containers appropriate for their classification. These
containers will be clearly labeled with warning notices.
Disposal Method: Hazardous waste will be disposed of through a licensed carrier and sent to an approved
vendor authorized by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) for treatment or disposal in a designated
hazardous waste pit or processing facility. By adhering to these guidelines, we aim to ensure safe and
environmentally responsible waste management practices across our operations.
