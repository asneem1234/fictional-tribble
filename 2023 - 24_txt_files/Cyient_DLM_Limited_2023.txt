Energy 
Management
Risk & 
Opportunity
Risk: Inefficient energy management is a 
critical risk due to the pressing need to reduce 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to meet 
environmental standards and mitigate climate 
change impacts. It impacts the Company’s 
sustainability targets and reputation among 
environmentally conscious consumers and 
investors.
Opportunity: Energy management presents a 
substantial opportunity to achieve significant 
cost savings through the adoption of energy-
efficient practices and technologies. Moreover, 
it can enhance the company’s sustainability 
credentials and competitive advantage in an 
increasingly eco-conscious marketplace.
To efficiently handle energy usage 
and emissions, we are scaling up the 
share of renewable energy within our 
energy portfolio while simultaneously 
leveraging energy conservation 
methods to reduce our consumption.
Negative/Positive
2
Diversity, 
Equity, and 
Inclusion
Opportunity
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) offers 
an opportunity to harness a wide range of 
perspectives and skills, enhancing creativity 
and driving innovation in product development. 
Embracing DEI also strengthens company culture 
and reputation, which can attract top talent and 
expand market reach by resonating with a diverse 
consumer base.

Health & 
Safety
Risk
Prolonged exposure to hazardous materials 
can lead to serious employee harm, operational 
disruptions, and potential legal liabilities. 
Inadequate health and safety standards can also 
tarnish the company’s reputation and result 
in costly financial penalties, affecting overall 
business stability.
We are committed to implementing 
rigorous safety protocols, providing 
continuous employee training, and 
ensuring compliance with industry 
regulations to address health and 
safety risks. By adopting advanced 
safety technologies and fostering a 
culture of safety awareness, we aim 
to prevent accidents and safeguard 
both our associates’ well-being and 
our company’s operational integrity.
Negative
4
Supply Chain
Management
Risk & 
Opportunity
Risk: Supply chain disruptions can lead to 
production halts and inventory shortages, 
harming the company’s ability to meet customer 
demands and resulting in financial loss. 
Additionally, reliance on a limited number of 
suppliers can increase vulnerability to external 
shocks such as geopolitical tensions or natural 
disasters.
Opportunity: Effective supply chain 
management can streamline operations, reduce 
costs, and improve lead times, ultimately 
enhancing customer satisfaction. It also opens 
avenues for building stronger, more collaborative 
relationships with suppliers, which can lead to 
innovation and a more resilient supply network.
Diversifying the company’s supplier 
base would reduce reliance on a 
limited number of suppliers and 
establishment of robust inventory 
management system will ensure 
uninterrupted production. 
Implementation of supply chain 
risk assessments and development 
of contingency plans will help in 
proactive mitigation and adaptation 
of the risks and bolster long-term 
supply chain resilience.

Initiatives

Details of the Initiative (Weblink, if

Outcome of the Initiative
1
Adoption of 
Renewable Energy 
in operation
The Mysuru facility has successfully 
integrated Renewable Energy 
sources, harnessing solar electricity 
for 50% of its operations, reflecting 
our commitment to sustainability. 
With a strong commitment towards 
environmental stewardship, we 
aim to exceed 80% in the near 
future, further reducing our carbon 
footprint and promoting clean 
energy operations.
The integration of Renewable 
Energy into our operations has 
resulted in a marked decrease in 
carbon emissions and substantial 
cost savings. This strategic shift not 
only aligns with global sustainability 
goals but also enhances our 
corporate responsibility toward a 
cleaner, renewable future.
2
Installation of LED 
Light Fixtures
95% of the lighting fixtures across 
our facilities have been upgraded to 
energy-efficient LEDs, bolstering 
our energy conservation efforts, 
and benefiting from the extended 
lifespan of these lighting solutions.
This widespread adoption of LED 
technology significantly reduces 
our energy consumption and 
maintenance costs, reflecting our 
dedication to sustainable practices.
3
Rainwater 
Harvesting System
All of our sites are equipped with 
rainwater harvesting pits, ensuring 
that the collected rainwater is 
effectively channelled into these 
designated catchment areas.
This system not only promotes the 
conservation of water resources but 
also plays a crucial role in recharging 
the groundwater levels at our 
facilities.
4
Improving Water 
Efficiency
To enhance water efficiency, 
we have installed sensor-based 
taps in all washrooms, effectively 
minimizing excess water usage 
through their smart operation. 
Moreover, with the implementation 
of Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) 
at our office, we are able to recycle 
wastewater, utilizing it for gardening 
and furthering our commitment to 
sustainable water management.
The implementation of sensor-
based taps and Sewage Treatment 
Plants (STPs) has significantly 
reduced our dependency on 
and usage of groundwater by 
establishing effective water 
consumption controls. These 
initiatives contribute to a more 
sustainable use of water resources, 
ensuring long-term ecological 
balance and operational efficiency.
5
Adopting 
Circularity
We have formulated a strategic plan 
to decrease plastic use throughout 
our operations and have already 
achieved a substantial reduction. 
In addition, we convert garden and 
food waste into vermicompost, 
which is then utilized as fertilizer for 
gardening.
Utilizing food and garden waste as 
compost enriches the soil with vital 
nutrients. It decreases reliance on 
synthetic fertilizers and also diverts 
organic materials from landfills.
