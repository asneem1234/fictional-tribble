1
Environmental 
Impact 
Assessment
O
 Environmental Impact Assessment 
(EIA) is a crucial process that helps 
evaluate the likely environmental, 
economic, and social impacts of a 
proposed project or development. 
By conducting a thorough EIA, the 
company can identify potential 
positive and negative impacts, 
and take necessary measures to 
enhance the beneficial impacts 
and mitigate the adverse ones. 
This can lead to more sustainable 
and environmentally responsible 
business practices.
 
Positive, as a well-executed 
EIA can help the company 
avoid costly environmental 
remediation or legal 
challenges, and identify 
opportunities for cost 
savings and operational 
efficiencies.
2
Anti-corruption 
practices of the 
company
R
Corruption can lead to legal 
and reputational risks, as well as 
financial losses for the company. 
Weak anti-corruption practices 
can expose the company to 
bribery, fraud, and other unethical 
business practices, which can 
result in fines, penalties, and 
damaged stakeholder trust.
 The Company has policy 
in place for anti-corruption 
and anti-bribery policy. 
This policy mandates the 
conduct of all business 
activities with honesty 
and adherence to ethical 
principles. 
Negative, as the company 
may face significant 
costs related to legal 
proceedings, fines, and 
the loss of business 
opportunities due to 
reputational damage.
3
Health & safety 
of employees
R
 Failure to maintain a safe work 
environment can lead to accidents, 
injuries, and even fatalities, which 
can result in legal liabilities, 
operational disruptions, and 
reputational damage.
The Company has a robust 
occupational health and 
safety management system 
covers all facilities and 
work sites.
The system, based on 
ISO 45001, ensures 
legal obligations are 
met, providing a secure 
working environment for 
employees.
Negative, as the company 
may face costs related to 
worker’s compensation 
claims, legal proceedings, 
and the loss of productivity 
due to work-related injuries 
or illnesses.
4
Development 
and well-
being of local 
communities
O
 Engaging with and supporting 
local communities can help the 
company build trust, enhance 
its social license to operate, and 
contribute to the sustainable 
development of the areas in which 
it operates.
 
Positive, as the company 
can benefit from improved 
community relations, 
reduced operational risks, 
and enhanced brand 
reputation.
5
Sustainability 
disclosures
O
 Transparent and comprehensive 
sustainability disclosures can help 
the company demonstrate its 
commitment to environmental 
and social responsibility, 
enhance stakeholder trust, and 
attract investors who prioritize 
sustainability.
 
Positive, as the company 
may be able to access 
sustainable finance, attract 
environmentally and 
socially conscious investors, 
and improve its overall 
financial performance 
through enhanced

Environmental 
declaration of 
products
O
Providing environmental 
declarations for products can 
help the company demonstrate 
the sustainability of its offerings, 
meet customer and regulatory 
requirements, and differentiate 
itself in the market.
 
Positive, as the company 
may be able to command 
a price premium for its 
sustainable products, 
access new markets, 
and enhance its overall 
competitiveness.
7
GHG emissions 
and climate 
change
R
Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 
and climate change pose 
significant risks to the company’s 
operations, supply chain, and 
reputation. Failure to mitigate and 
adapt to the impacts of climate 
change can lead to physical risks, 
such as extreme weather events 
and resource scarcity, as well as 
transition risks, such as changing 
regulations, market shifts, and 
reputational damage.
 Shyam Metalics is actively 
mitigating it through 
strategic initiatives. Their 
solarization project, with 
a capacity of 1.085 MWp, 
reduces CO2 emissions by 
12.5 Lacs Kg annually—
equivalent to planting 
trees. Additionally, 
investments in emission 
control technology and 
the introduction of electric 
vehicles demonstrate 
their commitment 
to sustainability 
and environmental 
responsibility.
Negative, as the company 
may face increased costs 
associated with the 
physical impacts of climate 
change, such as damage 
to assets and disruptions 
to operations and supply 
chains.
8
Adoption of 
innovative, 
resource- 
efficient and 
low carbon 
technologies 
and solutions
O
 Adopting innovative, resource-
efficient, and low-carbon 
technologies and solutions can 
help the company improve its 
environmental performance, 
reduce costs, and capitalize on 
emerging market opportunities 
in the clean technology and 
renewable energy sectors.
 
Positive, as the company 
may be able to reduce 
operating costs through 
improved resource 
efficiency, access green 
financing and incentives, 
and generate new revenue 
streams from the sale of 
clean technologies and 
services.
9
Life cycle 
assessment of 
products and 
processes
O
 Conducting life cycle assessments 
(LCAs) of products and processes 
can help the company identify 
opportunities to improve the 
environmental performance of 
its offerings, reduce resource 
consumption, and minimize waste.
 
Positive, as the company 
may be able to reduce costs 
associated with resource 
use, waste management, 
and compliance, while 
also enhancing its market 
competitiveness through 
the development of more 
sustainable products.
10
Sustainability in 
the supply chain
O
Promoting sustainability practices 
throughout the supply chain 
can help the company mitigate 
environmental and social risks, 
enhance the resilience of its 
operations, and contribute to 
the overall sustainability of its 
business.
 
Positive, as the company 
may be able to reduce 
costs associated with 
supply chain disruptions, 
regulatory compliance, and 
reputational risks.

Water and 
effluents
R
Failure to manage water 
resources responsibly can lead to 
operational disruptions, regulatory 
non-compliance, and reputational 
damage.
 The Company measures 
and monitors water 
consumption across all 
its business locations 
and operations. The 
company’s commitment 
to water stewardship 
involves identifying areas 
where water conservation 
techniques can be 
effectively implemented. 
Additionally, SMEL actively 
promotes the use of 
recycled water to limit 
overall consumption.
Also, The Company has 
Zero Liquid Discharge 
(ZLD) in all the plant to 
ensure rigorous treatment 
of wastewater from its 
facilities, adhering strictly 
to applicable standards 
and regulations. 
Negative, as the company 
may face increased 
costs associated with 
water scarcity, such as 
higher prices and supply 
disruptions, as well as costs 
related to wastewater 
treatment and compliance 
with environmental 
regulations.
12
Air pollution
R
Failure to address air emissions 
can result in fines, legal challenges, 
and community opposition to the 
company’s activities.
 The company ensures 
the active maintenance of 
power equipment, coupled 
with the regulation of 
the air-to-fuel ratio. This 
strategic approach is 
instrumental in mitigating 
the generation of 
Nitrogen Oxides (NOx), 
thereby contributing to 
a more sustainable and 
environmentally-friendly 
operation.
Negative, as the company 
may face increased 
costs associated with 
air pollution control 
technologies, regulatory 
fines and penalties, and 
legal challenges.

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishment. Describe the strategy adopted by your Company to 
reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes. 
	
The facility actively recycles and repurposes solid waste materials. Middling and rejects from the coal washery serve as fuel for the FBC 
Boiler. Additionally, ash, accretion, and Dolchar from the DRI kilns find new life in the captive brick-making unit and contribute to boiler 
fuel. The facility redirects dedusting dust to the Pellet plant, while tar from the PGP plant is sent to authorized recyclers. Slag and dust 
generated during the steel-making process creatively contribute to reclaiming abandoned mines, and fly ash from the boiler fills old stone 
quarries. The slag from the Ferro alloy plant serves in concrete works or acts as landfill, ensuring that every by-product has a purpose. The 
facility also responsibly disposes of hazardous waste such as used oil and spent resin through authorized channels, emphasizing their 
commitment to a process free of toxic chemicals.
