Opportunity
Product stewardship presents 
a strategic opportunity for 
the organization to embed 
sustainability into its business 
strategy, thereby enhancing 
the environmental performance 
of its products. Additionally, 
as the demand for sustainable 
products increases, products 
with a lower environmental 
footprint are likely to drive 
higher sales.

Water and 
Effluents
Risk and 
Opportunity
Water is a crucial natural 
resource for our business. 
Implementing effective 
water management and 
conservation practices not 
only reduces costs but also 
ensures uninterrupted business 
operations.
To mitigate risks associated 
with wastewater, we 
have implemented robust 
wastewater management 
systems. Both of our plants 
are equipped with zero liquid 
discharge (ZLD) facilities. 
These ZLD systems are

Effluent water can contain 
contaminants and if not 
properly controlled or treated, it 
poses significant environmental 
risks. Achieving zero liquid 
discharge from plants mitigates 
these risks entirely.
designed to effectively treat 
and process wastewater, 
ensuring that no liquid 
discharge is released. The 
treated wastewater is either 
reused within the facility 
or subjected to additional 
treatment processes.

Waste 
management 
and 
Circularity
Risk
Improper disposal of lubricant 
waste can contaminate water, 
land, and/or seawater with 
harmful chemicals, adversely 
affecting ecosystems 
and human health. Non-
compliance with waste 
management regulations also 
poses significant risks to the 
organization. Therefore, proper 
waste management is essential 
to prevent environmental 
and legal repercussions. This 
highlights the importance of 
responsible disposal, recycling, 
and strict adherence to 
regulations.
We have implemented 
robust waste management 
practices based on the 3R 
principle: Reduce, Recycle, 
and Reuse. Additionally, 
we have engaged a waste 
management agency to 
collect waste on our behalf, 
ensuring compliance 
with Extended Producer 
Responsibility (EPR) 
regulations.

Climate 
Change 
Strategy
Risk and 
Opportunity
Climate change presents both 
risks and opportunities for 
Gulf Oil. Stakeholders expect 
organizations to disclose 
climate-related risks and detail 
their management strategies. 
Additionally, climate change 
offers Gulf Oil the chance to 
develop sustainable products, 
aligning with evolving market 
demands and expectations.

Human capital development 
is crucial for empowering

are prepared to take on new 
roles and responsibilities, as 
opportunities arise. Investing in

whole.

Occupational 
Health and 
safety
Risk and 
opportunity
Occupational Health and 
Safety (OHS) serves as a 
risk management strategy 
designed to mitigate and 
minimize work environment-
related risks. OHS addresses 
hazard risks, human risks, legal 
and compliance risks, and 
reputational risks.
GOLIL has implemented a 
robust Health and Safety 
management system and 
process. The company 
identifies and mitigates risks 
through Hazard Identification 
and Risk Assessment 
(HIRA) and aspect impact 
studies. Employee training 
is a key focus, with regular 
sessions to educate and 
update staff on health 
and safety measures. By 
investing in comprehensive 
training programs, Gulf 
Oil equips its workforce 
with the knowledge and 
skills to maintain a safe 
working environment. This 
proactive approach not 
only protects employees 
from potential hazards 
but also underscores our 
commitment to their well-
being.

Does the entity have processes in place to avoid/ manage conflict of interests involving members of the 
Board? (Yes/No) If Yes, provide details of the same.
	
Yes, GOLIL has established processes to manage and avoid conflicts of interest involving members of the Board and 
Key Management Personnel (KMPs). We adhere to a Code of Conduct which is conveniently available on our website. 
Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report (Contd.)
14
The Code of Conduct is specifically designed for the Board of Directors and Senior Management, as mandated by SEBI 
(Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations 2015. In line with this Code, all Board Members, Senior 
Management Personnel (SMPs), and KMPs annually affirm, and whenever changes occur, that they have no material, 
financial, or commercial transactions that could potentially be in conflict with the Company’s interests. 
	
The Company also has a separate Code of Conduct addressing conflicts of interest, applicable to Senior Management 
and Directors. We recognize that financial conflicts of interest occur when an individual stands to gain or lose financially 
from a decision they are involved in. These interests can be direct or indirect. On the other hand, we also recognize that 
non-financial conflicts of interest arise when an individual is influenced by factors other than financial gain, potentially 
leading to bias or the appearance of bias. 
	
To ensure transparency and integrity, Directors abstain from participating in Board or Committee meeting agenda items 
where they hold an interest or are perceived to have an interest. This strict adherence to protocols and avoidance of 
conflicts of interest upholds the highest standards of professionalism within the Company’s governance structure.

and recycle or dispose of an equivalent amount of plastic packaging across 
all states where the Company operates, in compliance with the Plastic Waste

security teams to truck drivers each time that any trucker enters our plants. We conducted near-miss campaign to 
make them aware about incidents and action that can lead to severe accidents, ask employees to report near-miss 
on regular basis in GO-Safe aap. To further our commitment to safety, PPE provision and alcohol testing of drivers at 
gate is being carried out. Recognizing workplace hygiene as a crucial element of safety, we ensure provision of rest 
room and safe drinking water for truck drivers and cleaners. Given our facilities see a high number of trucks every

experiences of workers through safety toolbox talks. Additionally, we follow a work permit system and conduct 
regular safety walks to ensure comprehensive hazard identification and risk assessment. Also, from time to time we 
conduct an aspect impact study for environmental risks that arise at our workplace. Finally, we also conduct EHS 
awareness training to ensure that all are aware of best and safe practices of carrying out their respective tasks.

GOLIL prioritizes the well-being of its employees by dedicating resources towards ensuring a safe and healthy workplace. 
This commitment is manifested through various initiatives, including comprehensive training programs, safety, and 
occupational health initiatives, all aimed at achieving zero workplace injuries and occupational illnesses. The Company 
emphasizes the importance of safety and comfort in the workplace.
	
To maintain health standards, GOLIL conducts annual health checkups for all its employees. Both of its manufacturing 
facilities, located in Silvassa and Chennai, adhere to international standards, specifically ISO 45001 for Occupational 
Health and Safety Management Systems and ISO 14001 for Environment Management Systems.
	
The Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) policy of the Company lays the foundation for these efforts. Regular 
awareness programs and training sessions led by the Safety Committee are essential components of the Company's 
strategy to educate employees about the use of safety equipment and ensuring personal protective equipment (PPE) 
compliance. Regular safety walks are organized to create behavioral shifts. A NearMiss Campaign was organized in 
FY 2023-2024 to educate people on how such incidences can be avoided by adhering to safety practices. Making 
use of digital technology, the GOSAFE App has been launched for GOLIL employees which brings all safety guidelines 
on fingertips of each of our employee. Moreover, the Company fosters a culture of safety consciousness among its 
employees by recognizing and rewarding adherence to health and safety practices through safety awards.
