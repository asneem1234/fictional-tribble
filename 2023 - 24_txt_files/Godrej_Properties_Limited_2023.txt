(indicate 
positive or

implications)
1.
GHG 
Management
Risk
Real estate assets contribute substantially to 
global emissions through energy consumption 
and waste production. Failure to effectively 
manage these emissions exposes the 
company to regulatory risks, as governments 
worldwide implement stricter climate-related 
regulations and carbon pricing mechanisms
1. Employ renewable energy systems, 
achieving IGBC Health and Well-being 
certifications, and prioritize sustainable 
procurement of materials.
2. Implementing internal carbon 
pricing and enhancing energy 
efficiency through LED lighting, smart 
technologies, and efficient HVAC 
systems are crucial steps, along with 
adopting water-saving measures 
like low-flow fixtures and rainwater 
harvesting.
Negative
2.
Waste 
Management
Risk
Waste management poses a significant risk 
to real estate sectors due to the significant 
waste generated by development, operation, 
and demolition of properties. As environmental 
regulations become stricter and stakeholders 
demand more sustainable practices, effective 
waste management is crucial to ensure 
compliance, reduce landfill use, and lower 
environmental impact.
1. We have implemented comprehensive 
strategies focused on waste diversion, 
recycling, and reuse. By prioritizing 
the minimization of construction and 
operational waste sent to landfills, 
we actively reduce our environmental 
impact.
2. Our initiatives include robust recycling 
programs and onsite material reuse 
practice. 3. Additionally, through our 
corporate social responsibility (CSR) 
projects, we offset additional waste 
from landfills, further enhancing our 
commitment to sustainability
Negative
3.
Occupational 
Health & 
Safety
Risk
For real estate companies, it is essential 
to inherent risks associated with property 
management, construction, and maintenance 
activities. Providing a safe work environment 
and preventing accidents are paramount 
to protecting employees, contractors, and 
tenants from potential hazards.
Compliance with safety regulations is not only 
a legal obligation but also a critical factor in 
mitigating financial risks related to workplace 
injuries, liability claims, and potential fines
1. Our OH&S Management system 
is aligned with ISO 45001: 2018, 
conducting thorough audits and risk 
assessments.
2.Comprehensive training programs 
ensure staff are versed in safety 
protocols. Robust incident reporting 
and transparent communication foster a 
safety culture, while regular monitoring 
and reviews enhance effectiveness.
Negative
4.
Sustainable 
Supply Chain
Risk
Sustainable supply chain management 
imposes inherent risks for a real estate 
business in today’s interconnected global 
economy. As the real estate industry relies 
heavily on suppliers for construction materials, 
maintenance services, and operational 
necessities, disruptions or unethical practices 
within the supply chain can significantly impact 
project timelines, costs, and reputation.
1. Our approach encompasses thorough 
supplier screening procedures, 
designed to assess potential partners 
based on sustainability criteria and 
compliance with environmental and 
social standards.
2. Our vendor screening processes 
ensure that all partners align with our 
sustainability objectives, promoting 
transparency, accountability, and 
responsible business practices 
throughout our operations.
Negative
5.
Product 
& Service 
Quality
Opportunity
At GPL, Our main priority is to create customer 
joy through best-in-class delivery with a focus 
on quality by ensuring high-quality products 
and services. By consistently delivering 
superior products and services, such as 
well-maintained properties, efficient property 
management, and responsive customer 
support, the company can cultivate positive 
relationships with tenants, investors, and other 
stakeholders.

developed to provide a structured approach for hazard identification, risk assessment, control implementation, and 
improvement of occupational health and safety (OH&S) within our organization.
	
This SOP systematically guides the process for hazard identification for all activities, following the hierarchy of controls 
framework. This framework includes the following steps:
	
•	
Elimination: Identifying opportunities to remove hazards entirely from the workplace.
	
•	
Substitution: Identifying safer alternatives to hazardous materials, equipment, or processes.
	
•	
Engineering Controls: Implementing physical changes to the work environment to isolate or minimize exposure to 
hazards.
	
•	
Administrative Controls: Implementing policies, procedures, and training programs to reduce exposure to hazards.
	
•	
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE): Providing appropriate PPE to workers as a final line of defense against identified 
hazards.

Key elements of the Safety Manual include:
	
Roles and Responsibilities: The manual explicitly outlines the roles and responsibilities of all stakeholders involved in the 
project, including management, supervisors, contractors, consultants, and workmen. Each stakeholder is provided with 
clear guidance on their specific duties regarding safety compliance and incident prevention.
	
Worker Roles: It is emphasized within the Safety Manual that workers possess full rights to refuse work if they identify any 
unsafe conditions during project execution. This right empowers workers to prioritize their safety and well-being, ensuring 
that potential hazards are promptly addressed to prevent accidents or injuries.

achieving science-based targets for 88.5% of our suppliers in the category pertaining to purchased goods and target, we are 
dedicated to identifying and addressing the major sources of GHG emissions. To effectively reduce net emissions, GPL has 
adopted a comprehensive and multi-faceted approach. Firstly, we are increasing the adoption of alternative clean energy 
options to minimize our reliance on fossil fuels. By transitioning to renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, 
we can significantly reduce our carbon footprint. Additionally, we are actively supporting energy efficiency measures such 
as installation of renewable energy generation system on site across, switching to fuel efficient and low carbon equipment 
across our operations. To offset any remaining emissions, GPL is undertaking proactive afforestation and land use focused 
projects. By investing in these initiatives, we contribute to the restoration and preservation of ecosystems, which serve as 
natural carbon sinks. Through this multi-pronged approach, which encompasses clean energy adoption, energy efficiency 
measures, and carbon offset projects, GPL is committed to achieving substantial reductions in GHG emissions. By aligning 
our actions with sustainability goals, we aim to play a significant role in mitigating climate change and creating a more

*Construction and Demolition Waste includes debris.
10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by 
your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices 
adopted to manage such wastes.
	
Response: Appropriate management of waste is of utmost importance to us and hence, we are committed to strictly adhering 
to waste management regulations. However, we go beyond mere compliance by adopting a proactive approach to minimize 
the environmental impact of the waste we generate. In line with regulations, we ensure that hazardous waste is disposed 
of through authorized third-party recyclers. For non-hazardous waste, including metal scraps and construction debris, we 
also work with authorized recyclers to ensure proper disposal and recycling. This enables us to divert these materials from 
landfills and promote a circular economy. In the case of non-hazardous organic waste, we have implemented composting 
methods. By composting organic waste, we can produce high quality manure that is then utilized for project landscaping 
and in our plant nursery. To further enhance our waste management efforts, GPL has established integrated decentralized 
solid waste management programs in Konark, Bhubaneshwar, Batala, and Agra. These programs aim to minimize waste 
sent to landfills by implementing effective waste reduction and recycling strategies. We believe that collective action is 
crucial for achieving meaningful results. Therefore, we actively partner with various organizations and engage in clean-up 
drives and campaign rallies. By collaborating with these entities, we can translate innovative waste management practices 
into tangible on-ground results. Through our comprehensive waste management initiatives and collaborative partnerships, 
we are committed to minimizing waste to landfill and making a positive environmental impact.
