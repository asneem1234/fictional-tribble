and Labour 
Management
Risk
Lack of emphasis to upholding the values 
of human rights and labour management 
can erode trust among patients, employees, 
investors, leading to difficulties in attracting and 
retaining talent, strikes, decrease productivity 
and give rise to operational inefficiencies.
Human rights and labour management 
are critical as it promotes wellbeing of 
employees and fair labour practices. 
By prioritising human rights, we ensure 
a positive work environment, improve 
employee 
morale, 
which 
helps 
in 
increased 
productivity. 
Also, 
Non-
discrimination mechanism fosters a fair 
and inclusive work environment. This 
leads to a more engaged and motivated 
workforce, as people can focus on their 
talents and contributions.

Water 
Management
Risk
Lack of effective water management can lead 
to operational disruptions and increased costs. 
Simultaneously, improper handling of water 
resources can contribute to hygiene issues, 
potentially compromising patient safety and 
increasing the risk of waterborne infections.
We have implemented multiple water 
saving 
initiatives 
at 
our 
hospitals. 
Currently, we recycle our wastewater 
through advanced Sewage Treatment 
Plants (STPs) for non-potable purposes. 
We employed Membrane Bioreactor 
(MBR) technology which helped us in 
utilising waste water through recycling.

Diversity, 
Equity and 
Inclusion
Opportunity
Diverse workforce brings a wider range of 
perspectives 
and 
experiences, 
fostering 
creativity, innovation, and better problem-
solving. When equity is ensured, everyone has 
a fair chance to succeed, leading to a more 
engaged and productive workforce. Inclusion 
creates a sense of belonging, allowing the 
workforce to contribute their best work. 
Our dedication to diversity and inclusion is 
exemplified by the impressive growth in female 
representation within our workforce over the 
years.

17
Supply Chain 
Management
Risk
Lack of supply chain management can lead 
to disruptions in the availability of critical 
resources 
and 
products 
when 
required. 
Inefficient supply chain processes can result in 
delays, increased costs, and stock shortages, 
affecting the Company's ability to ensure 
availability of critical patient requirements.
We 
place 
a 
strong 
emphasis 
on 
responsible sourcing within our supply 
chain. Our strategic approach to supply 
chain management focuses on the 
integration 
of 
advanced 
analytics, 
robust procurement strategies, and agile 
logistics to ensure the timely availability 
of medical supplies, pharmaceuticals, 
and cutting-edge medical equipment. We 
have a Supplier Code of Conduct which 
outlines the expectations for suppliers, 
manufacturers, and distributors to align 
with the Company's values.

Essential Indicators
1.	
Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity. 
	
We engage with our stakeholders including Investors, Customers, Healthcare professionals, Employees, Communities, Regulators, 
Suppliers, and Industry Associations to understand their expectations and concerns at regular intervals. Effective stakeholder 
engagement is the cornerstone of building strong, mutually beneficial relationships. By identifying and understanding the needs, 
interests, and potential concerns of our stakeholders, we can mitigate risks and identify opportunities, drive innovation, foster 
collaboration, and increase trust. 
	
Our stakeholder engagement process consists of the following steps:
 
 
Identifying key stakeholders involves recognising the groups or individuals who hold significant influence over our operations 
or are directly affected by the Company’s activities
 
 
Developing a clearly defined communication strategy requires finalising different approaches to engage with stakeholders, 
considering factors such as communication frequency and the preferred mode of communication
 
 
Engagement objectives help specify the desired goals and outcomes of the engagement process. For example, objectives 
might include enhancing customer satisfaction or improving employee retention rates
 
 
To measure the effectiveness of the engagement plan, we define specific metrics. These metrics allow us to quantitatively 
assess the success of our engagement efforts. Additionally, we diligently track our progress against these metrics to maintain 
transparency and accountability
 
 
We frequently evaluate and refine the stakeholder engagement plan to ensure its continued effectiveness and relevance as 
our operations evolve

Leadership Indicators
1.	
Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and social 
topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board. 
	
We conduct materiality assessment and stakeholder engagement process every 2-3 years to identify and reassess Economic, 
Environmental, Social topics that are significant to our business
 
 
During the process, we engage with identified stakeholders to understand and obtain their insights on sustainability topics 
 
 
Insights obtained from the stakeholders are analysed to finalise our material topics
 
 
The finalised material topics are presented to the ESG and Sustainability Committee and Board members 
 
 
We obtain feedback from the Board and ESG and Sustainability Committee and define our action plan for implementation
2.	
Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, and social 
topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these topics 
were incorporated into policies and activities of the entity.  
	
Yes, stakeholder consultation is a key component in supporting the identification and management of environmental and 
social topics. The ESG and Sustainability Committee, which is a board-level committee plays a pivotal role in this process. The 
said Committee is responsible for endorsing the sustainability vision and goals, monitoring progress, and reviewing statutory 
performance obligations on Sustainability and its governed by the charter approved by the Board. Inputs from stakeholders on 
environmental and social issues are actively sought through various engagement platforms and are then taken into consideration 
by the ESG and Sustainability Committee. For instance, feedback received on reducing the environmental footprint has led to 
the implementation of more energy-efficient practices and the adoption of greener technologies within our hospitals. Similarly, 
social concerns raised by stakeholders have been addressed by enhancing community health programmes and improving 
patient care services.
	
Materiality assessments are instrumental in guiding stakeholder consultations as they help to pinpoint the most pertinent 
environmental, social, and governance (ESG) topics that resonate with both the organisation and its stakeholders.  The committee 
is also apprised on the materiality assessment procedures and the key topics which has been highlighted during the assessment. 
By identifying these key issues, we ensures that stakeholder engagement is concentrated on areas with the highest impact and 
relevance. Stakeholders are thus able to provide targeted insights and recommendations on the ESG matters that are most critical 
to them and to the Company's operations. The insights gained from these consultations are then integrated into our policies and 
strategic initiatives, ensuring that the sustainability endeavours are closely aligned with stakeholder expectations and are geared 
towards driving long-term value and sustainable growth.
3.	
Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/ marginalized 
stakeholder groups. 
	
We are committed to making quality healthcare accessible to all, especially to those in need. As a responsible healthcare provider, 
the Company is dedicated to its social responsibility of improving patient care and community health. In this regard, we have set 
up a dedicated desk to assist patients covered by the government’s Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) programme. To cater to 
EWS patients, we have allocated 157 beds, and the daily availability of these beds is clearly communicated on the notice board at 
the Admission Counter and updated on the government’s website. 
	
In addition to its EWS-focused facilities in Delhi and Mumbai, we go above and beyond by never refusing assistance to critically 
injured patients across its entire network, irrespective of their financial ability to pay. This approach reflects the Company’s 
unwavering commitment to providing compassionate and equitable healthcare services to all segments of society.

5.	
Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues.  
	
We have a well-defined Grievance Redressal Policy to address and resolve any grievances related to harassment or human rights 
violations. The Policy establishes a structured mechanism for handling such issues, ensuring employees' concerns are effectively 
addressed. Here is an overview of the internal mechanisms in place:

We have taken proactive steps to ensure that patients/customers are well-informed about the safe and responsible usage of

Hospitals, which provides clear instructions and guidance in multiple languages. Additionally, we offers pre- and post-treatment 
counselling to patients, where healthcare professionals emphasise the importance of adhering to prescribed treatment regimens 
and the correct use of medical products. We also hosts workshops and seminars aimed at educating both patients and the broader 
community on health-related topics, including the responsible utilisation of healthcare services. Furthermore, we leverage digital 
platforms, such as website and social media channels, to share educational content and engage with patients/customers directly, 
offering them access to reliable information at their convenience. These efforts are part of our commitment to patient safety, 
ensuring that they are equipped with the knowledge needed to make informed decisions about their healthcare.

We used our professional judgement as Assurance Provider for 
selection of sample of the Company’s locations/facilities and non-
financial information for the verifications.
We conducted a review and verification of data collection, 
collation, and calculation methodologies, and a general review of 
the logic of inclusion/omission of relevant information/data in the 
Report. Our review process included:
 
 
Evaluate and assess the appropriateness of the quantification 
methods used to arrive at the non-financial/sustainability 
information of the BRSR Core Indicators and IAR;
 
 
Review of consistency of data/information within the Report 
as well as between the Report and source;
 
 
Engagement through discussions with personnel at both 
corporate and plant/facility levels who are accountable for 
the data and information presented in the Report;
 
 
Execution of an audit trail of claims and data streams, to 
determine the level of accuracy in collection, transcription, 
and aggregation;
 
 
Review of data collection and management procedures, 
and related internal controls.
Limitations & exclusions
There are inherent limitations in an assurance engagement, 
including, for example, the use of judgment and selective 
testing of data. Accordingly, there are possibilities that material 
misstatements in the sustainability information of the Report may 
remain undetected.
The assurance scope specifically excludes:
 
 
Data and information outside the defined reporting period 
(1st April 2023 to 31st March 2024);
 
 
Review of the ‘economic and/or financial performance 
indicators’ included in the Reports or on which reporting is 
based; we have been informed by the Company that these 
are derived from the Company’s audited financial records; 
 
 
The Company’s statements and claims related to 
any topics other than those listed in the ‘Scope and 
boundary of assurance’;
 
 
The Company's statements that describe qualitative/
quantitative assertions, expression of opinion, belief, 
inference, aspiration, expectation, aim or future intention.
Our observations 
The Company's sustainability disclosures, as defined within the 
assurance scope and boundary, are fairly reliable. The Company 
has effectively consolidated data from various sources at the 
central level. To enhance auditability, the Company may consider 
implementing standardized protocols for data management and 
environmental data reporting across all units.
Our above observations, however, do not affect our conclusion 
regarding the Report.
Our conclusions
Based on the scope of our review, we concluded the following:
 
 
Reasonable Assurance of BRSR Core indicators: The 
non-financial sustainability disclosures of the BRSR 
Core indicators as mentioned in ‘Scope and boundary 
of assurance’ reasonably fulfil the criteria of relevance, 
completeness, reliability, neutrality, and understandability 
as per ‘reasonable’ assurance criteria;
 
 
Limited Assurance of selected indicators for BRSR (other than 
core) and IAR: Based on the procedures performed, nothing 
has come to our attention that causes us not to believe 
that the disclosures of the Company is presented fairly, in 
accordance with the relevant reporting guidelines/standards.

Max Healthcare Institute Limited
2nd Floor, Capital Cyberscape, Sector-59,
Gurgaon, Haryana – 122 102.
Independent Assurance Statement on Business Responsibility 
and Sustainability Report (BRSR) disclosures and select 
sustainability non-financial disclosures contained in Integrated 
Annual Report’s (IAR) for the financial year 2023-24.
Introduction and objective of engagement
Max Healthcare Institute Limited (the 'Company') has developed 
its Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (‘BRSR’) 
including the BRSR Core Indicators1, based on the BRSR reporting 
guidelines prescribed by SEBI for listed entities. The reporting 
criteria have been derived from the Principles of National 
Guidelines on Responsible Business Conduct, 2018 (NGRBC), 
and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol - A Corporate Accounting 
and Reporting Standard. The Company has also developed its 
Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 (‘IAR’) based on the principles 
of the Integrated Reporting (<IR>) Framework published by the 
International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) and in reference 
to Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards. The BRSR would 
form a part of the IAR.
BDO India LLP (BDO) was engaged by the Company to provide 
independent assurance on select non-financial sustainability 
disclosures in the BRSR and IAR (the ‘Report’) for the period 1st 
April 2023 to 31st March 2024. 
The Company’s responsibilities
The content of the Report and its presentation are the sole 
responsibilities of the Management of the Company. The 
Company’s Management is also responsible for the design, 
implementation, 
and 
maintenance 
of 
internal 
controls 
relevant to the preparation of the Report, so that it is free from 
material misstatement.
BDO’s responsibility
BDO’s responsibility, as agreed with the Management of the 
Company, is to provide assurance on the BRSR Core Indicators 
and those of IAR as described in the ‘Scope & boundary of 
assurance’ section below. We do not accept or assume any 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person or 
organization. Any reliance a third party may place on the Report 
is entirely at its own risk. 
Assurance standard and criteria
We conducted our assurance engagement in accordance with 
International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 
(Revised), “Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews 
of Historical Financial Information”, and ISAE 3410, “Assurance 
Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statement”, issued by the 
International Auditing and Standards Board. 
We applied the criteria of ‘Reasonable’ Assurance for non-
financial Core Indicators of BRSR (Business Responsibility 
& Sustainability Report), and criteria of ‘Limited’ Assurance 
for select non-financial sustainability information of the IAR 
(Integrated Annual Report).
Scope & boundary of assurance
We have assured the BRSR Core Indicators1, and other select 
sustainability indicators of the Integrated Annual Report, 
pertaining to the Company’s non-financial performance for the 
period 1st April 2023 through 31st March 2024. We understand 
that the financial information in the Report is derived from the 
Company’s audited financial records.
The 
reporting 
scope 
and 
boundary 
cover 
the 
Company’s operations. 
Assurance methodology
Our assurance process entailed conducting procedures to gather 
evidence regarding the reliability of the disclosures covered in 
the assurance scope. The physical verification on sample basis 
was carried out at the following locations:
