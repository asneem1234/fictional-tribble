1
Employee 
Health & 
Safety
Risk
Health & Safety has an 
impact on employee well-
being (injury / ill health) and 
productivity (loss of man-
hours) apart from loss of 
earnings for the Company.
Predictive and preventive 
initiatives have been put in 
place to ensure employee

mishap shall put life / 
property in danger and 
also affect company’s 
earnings and reputation.
2

Management
Opportunity
Employees are contributors 
to value creation. Recruiting 
talented people and training 
them adequately to build their 
competencies and skills is

future growth by providing a 
quality differentiator.
Robust 
processes 
for 
acquiring 
and 
retaining 
the talent exist. Company 
focuses on Learning and 
Development initiatives in 
the areas of knowledge,

performance.
3
Climate 
Action
Risk and 
opportunity
Climate change can pose 
significant 
risk 
to 
the 
Company’s business. It can 
affect all key stakeholders 
as well as the Company’s 
strategy 
and 
financial 
resources. It also offers 
opportunities arising from 
innovations 
in 
reducing 
emissions, energy efficiency 
and renewable energy.
Company 
has 
taken 
initiatives in the areas 
of 
water 
conservation, 
renewable energy (solar 
power) 
and 
promoting 
water as well as energy 
conserving products.

incurred to prevent / 
mitigate the impact of 
climate change in the 
short to medium term.
Positive – Benefits will 
accrue in the medium / 
long term to the Company 
as well as customers.
4
Circular 
Economy
Risk and 
Opportunity
Proper waste collection and 
reuse / recycling processes 
are essential to minimize 
waste and tackle harmful 
effects of waste generation.
Water being a limited resource 
will affect the operations and 
Company stakeholders.
Company 
focuses 
on 
approaches for reducing 
generation, 
segregation, 
responsible disposal and 
increasing reuse / recycling 
of both hazardous, non-
hazardous waste and water 
conservation / recycling.
Positive

generated, 
recovered, 
recycled is used back in 
our processes leading 
to reduced costs and 
improved earnings.
5
Sustainable 
Innovation
Opportunity
Innovation management is 
important by focusing on 
development of new products, 
continuous R&D for improving 
product efficiencies, use of 
clean technology for business 
operations etc.
Company 
is 
focused 
on 
R&D 
initiatives, 
technology up gradation 
and 
PLM 
(Product 
Lifecycle Management).
Positive – Development 
of 
resource 
efficient 
new products and overall 
reduced lifecycle costs of 
products.
6
Responsible 
Supply Chain
Risk
Lack of sustainable sourcing 
approaches 
or 
efforts 
to build resilient supply 
chain can lead to supply / 
business disruptions due to 
unforeseen circumstances.
Company has integrated 
environmental, 
ethical 
and social performance 
factors into the process of 
selecting and periodically 
evaluating its key suppliers.
Negative – Supply chain 
disruptions will lead to 
disturbed 
production 
schedules and delayed 
deliveries to customers 
with consequent losses 
to the Company.

and actions as required. Stakeholders’ Engagement outcomes are shared through SBU’s and MD’s presentations to the Board. 
2. 	 Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental

party survey and gathered their inputs to determine and prioritize the sustainability issues that matters most to sustainability 
of its business operations.

expectations for buyback scheme gave birth to Project Renovare resulting in end of life product management promoting 
circular economy (the details of which are given in Principle 3 disclosures – essential indicator no. 3 and leadership indicator 
nos. 4,5), Suppliers’ need resulted in Supplier Quality Improvement Program with 35 key suppliers resulting in reduction in 
rejection PPM by almost 83%, Girls education was enhanced after receiving feedback through KPCL’s Society Perception 
Survey by providing life skills and English language education in addition to enhancing academic skills through its CSR 
initiative (Bharari, a new school health initiative, Releshani was launched through Company’s CSR for adolescent boys and 
girls after taking into consideration the views and needs perceived through various interactions with school teachers, parents 
and students themselves).

Initiative designed towards imparting future ready skills (like Diploma in Mechatronics & Smart Factory) and ensuring 
sustainable employability gives opportunities to the most vulnerable and deprived sections of the society (e. g. 37% of 100 
students supported currently are girls out of whom 10 are orphans and another 9 have only single mothers).
