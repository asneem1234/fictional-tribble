Data Security  
& Customer  
Privacy
Risk
Companies are assessed 
based 
on 
the 
amount 
of 
personal 
data 
they 
collect, 
their 
exposure 
to evolving or increasing 
privacy regulations, their 
vulnerability 
to 
potential 
data breaches, and their 
data protection systems.
Share India relies on its 
technology 
infrastructure. 
As 
the 
majority 
of 
transactions are processed 
digitally, 
which 
involves 
cyber/ 
information 
security risk. To protect its 
businesses, 
customers, 
infrastructure and internal 
users from security threats, 
it is critical for Share India 
to focus on data privacy 
and 
cyber 
security 
by 
implementing 
measures 
and 
strengthening 
its 
systems and processes.
The Company has framed 
policies with respect to 
information 
technology/ 
cyber 
security 
risk 
which set forth limits, 
mitigation 
strategies 
and 
internal 
controls. 
Cyber Security and Cyber 
Resilience Policy are in 
place for protecting the 
organization’s cyberspace 
against 
cyber-attacks, 
threats and vulnerabilities. 
The 
Company 
is 
continuously 
working 
upon 
enhancing 
data 
privacy and cyber security

improve 
security 
posture. Also, all the

periodic basis to ensure 
its effectiveness.

expose us to reputational 
risk, 
litigation 
risk 
and 
also regulatory risk in the 
form of disciplinary action, 
fine, penalty, etc.

Transparency  
in Product &  
Service  
Offerings
Risk
Transparency in product and 
service offerings is crucial for 
an online trading platform. 
It builds trust among clients, 
promotes fair and informed 
decision-making, 
and 
fosters a level playing field. 
Transparent disclosure of 
fees, charges and terms 
helps clients understand 
the true costs of investing. 
Clear 
information 
about 
investment 
options, 
risks, 
and 
performance 
enables clients to make 
well-informed 
choices. 
Additionally, 
transparent 
reporting 
on 
execution 
quality and order handling 
practices 
ensures 
fairness 
and 
minimizes 
conflicts 
of 
interest. 
Ultimately, 
transparency 
enhances 
the 
platform’s 
reputation, 
attracts 
and 
retains 
clients, 
and 
contributes 
to 
a 
healthy 
and 
trustworthy 
trading environment.
Policies are in place to 
ensure 
Share 
India’s 
objectives in operating as a 
transparent organization. 
The Company aims at 
inculcating 
appropriate 
procedures and actions 
are in place in case any 
deviation is observed.
Improved disclosures for 
increased transparency.
Negative
Non-transparency 
in 
product 
and 
service 
offerings may cause loss of 
reputation and customers 
of the Company thereby 
adversely 
impacting 
businesses of the Company. 
It may further lead to 
regulatory issues resulting in 
restrictions on the business 
of the Company.

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, 
targets and achievements
“Sustainability isn’t just a commitment, it’s our compass for responsible action, guiding us towards a future where 
Environmental, Social and Governance principles converge for lasting positive impact”.
As an Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Head overseeing Business Responsibility and Sustainability initiatives 
at Share India, I’m proud to share our journey in addressing ESG challenges. In a rapidly evolving landscape, we have 
encountered numerous obstacles, but also seized opportunities to make meaningful changes.
Our commitment to transparency and accountability motivates us to do regular assessment to be able to improve our 
performance. We have a team of dedicated individuals which works on ESG activities in the Company. The team meets at 
regular intervals to track the progress of our ESG activities, deviation thereof and take corrective action where necessary. 
This process helps us to identify our areas of improvement, prepare a road map to achieve our goals and also to set a new 
target for ESG related developments. However, our work is far from complete.
We recognize the need for ongoing innovation and collaboration to address complex societal and environmental challenges. 
Looking ahead, we remain steadfast in our dedication to advancing sustainability, driving positive social impact and 
upholding the highest standards of corporate governance.

Here are some key strategies for effective waste management in office settings:
	
Paper Waste: Paper waste management involves implementing activities to reduce the generation of paper waste, maximize 
paper   recycling, and responsibly dispose of paper waste that cannot be recycled. We have implemented strong measures 
for digitizing processes to reduce the need of paper. Further, minimizing the usage of paper across offices is an ongoing 
activity such as access based printing, default printing on both sides of the paper etc. Employees are encouraged to adopt 
digital/online mediums to reduce paper consumption. At Share India, we have a comprehensive paper recycling program that 
includes collecting, sorting, and recycling paper waste generated in the workplace. Furthermore, we have also implemented 
recycling of paper waste through registered vendors/partners, which recycles the paper as per proper waste disposal 
mechanism to reduce the impact on the environment of paper consumption.  
	
Plastic Waste: Managing plastic waste in offices is crucial for reducing environmental pollution and promoting Sustainability. 
We have minimized the use of plastic in our office. We also encourage our staff to avoid using plastic items, look for the 
substitutes and also initiated recycling of plastic waste through registered vendors/partners.
	
Electronic Waste (E-waste) Recycling: Our E-waste broadly includes old computers, monitors, printers, servers, scanners, 
UPSs, batteries, air conditioners, etc. Our Company’s IT team and admin officials are making efforts for optimum utilization.
