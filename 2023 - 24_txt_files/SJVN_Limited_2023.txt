Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your company to reduce usage 
of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes 
 
SJVN focuses on minimizing waste at source by implementing and adopting efficient technologies and solution, sorting out recyclable materials, organic 
waste, and hazardous waste to ensure proper waste disposal and recycle of recyclable waste materials. The company has buy-back policy for e-waste 
and battery waste with authorized vendor for safe disposal and appropriate recycle of the product, after it reaches its end of life. At SJVN, specific 
procedure and guidelines are laid down for proper handling and management of hazardous, chemical, and toxic waste, including storage, transportation, 
83
treatment, and disposal of such materials, ensuring compliance with regulatory norms and environmental standards. Bio composter & Plastic waste 
bailing machine have been procured for treatment of solid waste of project affected villages and project colony. A recycling plant is installed at CHQ 
building to convert kitchen wastes such as vegetables, fruits etc. into compost which can be used to condition the soil.
