Onward Technologies Limited’s whistleblower policy ensures that all employees 
can report any observed malpractices, whether concerning themselves or other 
employees. Any employee with a grievance must submit a written complaint to 
the Ombudsman. In cases where an employee needs to ﬁle a complaint against 
the Ombudsman, a copy of the complaint should be forwarded to the Chairman 
of the Audit Committee. If the matter is determined to be a personal dispute or 
is deemed suitable for resolution through the standard grievance settlement 
procedure, the Ombudsman may assist the complainant in resolving the matter 
amicably without further investigation. However, if the Ombudsman concludes that 
serious misconduct is involved, an investigation may be initiated, which may involve 
questioning and the involvement of third parties to gather evidence. Protected 
disclosures can be sent on whistleblower@onwardgroup.com
and to the Vigilance and Ethics ofﬁcer i.e. the Compliance Ofﬁcer of the Company

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases.
 
At Onward Technologies Limited, ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees is of utmost 
importance. Any threats, adverse consequences, or retaliation against complainants are completely against 
our company’s core values. As part of this commitment, we have implemented several mechanisms. Firstly, 
we provide mandatory Prevention of Sexual Harassment (PoSH) induction to all employees, including new 
hires, covering approximately 2000 to 3000 employees annually. Additionally, we conduct quarterly sessions 
led by external Internal Committee (IC) members to communicate our policies effectively.
 
Moreover, our ofﬁces across India prominently display posters conveying our zero-tolerance stance towards 
workplace harassment, accompanied by a dedicated email address (posh@onwardgroup.com) for lodging 
complaints. We also have a whistleblower policy accessible on both our HRMS and website, ensuring that 
employees can report violations without fear of reprisal and can expect full support from the company. 
Complaints are directly addressed to senior management via whistleblower@onwardgroup.com. Any form of 
threats or retaliation against employees who report violations or assist in investigations is strictly prohibited. 
All relevant policies are readily available on our website for easy reference.

Do human rights requirements form part of your business agreements and contracts? (Yes/No).

stakeholders in the company across all entities/geographies of Onward Tech. The policy covers aspects
