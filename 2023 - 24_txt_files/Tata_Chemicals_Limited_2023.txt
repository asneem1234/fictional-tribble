Details
Yes, the Company has an Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption (ABAC) policy. The Company has adopted formal mechanism 
for the Directors, employees and other external stakeholders to report their concerns about unethical behaviour, fraud or 
violation of the Company’s Code of Conduct. The Policy provides adequate protection to safeguard employees who avail 
of the mechanism. No personnel of the Company have been denied access to the Chairperson of the Audit Committee. 
The Vigil Mechanism includes policies viz. the Whistle-Blower Policy, the Gift and Hospitality Policy, the ABAC Policy and 
the Anti-Money Laundering (‘AML’) Policy. The ABAC and AML policies primarily covers risk assessment, third party due 
diligence, training & awareness, and audit & reporting. 
The above Policies require the Company to appoint a senior official as the Compliance Officer who shall be responsible for 
implementation of the Policies. Under the above Policies, Compliance Officers directly report about any violation of the 
Policies to the Audit Committee Chair. These are also reviewed by the Board of Directors of the Company. The Whistleblower 
Policy and Vigil Mechanism ensures that strict confidentiality is maintained in such cases and no unfair treatment is 
meted out to a Whistleblower. The Company, as a Policy, condemns any kind of discrimination, harassment, victimisation 
or any other unfair employment practice being adopted against Whistleblowers. With an aim to create awareness, during 
the year under review, the Company also undertook a series of communication and training programmes on the values, 
TCoC and other ethical practices of the company for internal stakeholders, vendors and distributors, partners etc. The 
Company also celebrated the month of July as Ethics Month with all communication and programmes centred around 
the theme “Ethics for a Sustainable Organisation”. A dedicated Ethics Helpline has been setup which is managed by an 
independent professional organisation for confidentially raising any ethical concerns or practices that violate the TCoC. 
The Ethics Helpline can be contacted to report any suspected or confirmed incident of fraud/misconduct on: E-mail: 
reportmyconcern@integritymatters.in Address: Principal Ethics Counsellor, Tata Chemicals Limited, Bombay House, 24 
Homi Mody Street, Fort, Mumbai - 400 001. The Whistleblower Policy as adopted by the Company is available on the

The Company has a process for Risk Management which is essential for preventing incidents, injuries, occupational disease, 
emergency control & prevention and business continuity. Considering the hazards associated with operations and hazardous 
chemicals used, sites have deployed structured Hazard Assessment, Risk Assessment and Management Process - both 
qualitative and quantitative which is regularly reviewed and mitigation plans are put in place for high-risk areas. The process 
also considers roles and responsibilities, monitoring control measures, competency training and awareness of individuals 
associated with such activities. Formal risk assessment training has been provided as appropriate. For all activities including 
routine or non-routine (permit / project activities) hazards are identified by a trained cross-functional team and risk assessment 
and management is done through Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA)/ Job Safety Analysis (JSA)/ Standard 
Operating Procedure (SOP) which is referred before starting any activity. The Company has procedures for process safety and 
functional safety including Layers of Protection Analysis (LOPA) and Safety Integrity Level (SIL).
	
	
Identified hazards and associated risks are addressed through operational control measures using hierarchy of control 
approach. Techniques like Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), what if-analysis, Failure Mode Effect Analysis (FMEA) are carried 
out on a case-to-case basis. On a day-to-day basis unsafe conditions and hazards are also identified by employees and 
reported in e-enabled portal - MDO. It is also extended to contractors working on sites to ensure their concerns are captured 
and added into MDO. The closure of same is tracked to ensure risk control at workplace. Storing and handling of toxic 
chemicals like ammonia, chlorine, flammable materials like fuel, etc. are identified as the major process hazards at the site

Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/ marginalized

The Company follows an integrated development approach which specifically targets the disadvantaged, vulnerable and marginalised 
stakeholders. It has been the Company’s constant endeavour to focus on inclusive and collaborative growth. The Company began its 
journey a few years ago by focussing on Affirmative Action (AA) i.e. disadvantaged communities and while the Company continues 
to progress on this roadmap, it has expanded its focus on diversity to additionally cover gender diversity, disadvantaged regions and 
persons with disability and LGBTQ, all of which are important segments that can help create a more sustainable organisation. Towards 
this objective, the Company has reconstituted its current Affirmative Action Council into a Diversity Council led by the MD & CEO and 
Senior Leaders to focus on these identified areas of AA agenda. The Company’s leadership drives the AA agenda across the organisation 
with passion and commitment. The Company’s integrated development interventions are based on the framework linked to the UN 
SDGs and has the following elements: building economic capital, ensuring environmental integrity, enablers for social, economic 
and environmental development and building social capital. All social initiatives under these elements are conducted around the 
Company’s areas of operations. This approach aims to improve the quality of life, especially in their neighbourhoods. As per the need 
assessment, the Scheduled Caste (SC) / Scheduled Tribes (ST) community in the Company’s neighbourhood regions aspires for better 
education, health care, better livelihood skills and employment. The internal job posting initiative Seamlessly Harnessing Internal 
Expertise (‘SHINE’) is further enhanced to include referrals for candidates from the economically and socially backward communities 
calling it SHINE+. Another corporate initiative was launched which has more reward for recruitment consultants for shortlisting of 
candidates that helps improve the Company’s employee diversity. The Company has a formal policy on Diversity and Inclusion (‘D&I’) 
which articulates and defines its commitment to this cause. From 2020 onwards, February is celebrated as the month of Diversity and 
Inclusion. During this month, sensitisation training is conducted for the senior leadership team along with various activities conducted 
across the Company such as focussed group discussions, panel discussions, expert speaker sessions on Business and Human Rights, 
Affirmative Action, play shops, quizzes, D&I room, communication through e-mailers, standees, placard, batches, etc. which helps 
sensitising employees on D&I, unconscious bias, inclusive behaviour, etc.

and merits further investigation an investigator, either internal or external is assigned. The investigator conducts investigation 
by gathering the data, validating, analysing and gives his observations & recommendations. The investigation report is further 
reviewed by the PEC and the recommendation is acted upon. The documentation of the action taken is filed for records. These 
are reviewed by MD & CEO and the Audit Committee.

Adoption of low emissions fuels is critical in achieving our decarbonisation goals. The Company has proactively 
embarked on multiple projects to shift to low carbon emission fuels; TCE Group is leading our efforts of 
transitioning to low emission fuel. The Company is committed to replace Natural Gas with use blue / green 
hydrogen. The Company have signed an offtake agreement with Vertex Hydrogen for the supply of over 200 
megawatts of low carbon Hydrogen. TCNA operations currently uses a mix of coal and natural gas for thermal 
energy. Over the next 3 to 5 years, the Company plans to increase the share of natural gas. Additionally, we're 
exploring shifting entirely to Small Modular Reactors. In India, we've successfully conducted trials for the 
use of biomass in our current boilers in FY 2023-24. The Company plans to scale up biomass procurement in 
FY 2024-25 to replace ~10% of coal. The Company is actively working on establishing a dependable supply 
chain to ensure consistent access to biomass for our Indian operations. The Company is also piloting energy 
crop plantations to build steady supply of biomass. The Company is increasing the use of renewable energy 
sources, such as solar, wind and hybrid power. 
Installation of solar panels of 2 MW capacity in Mithapur are nearing completion. Additionally, the Company 
plans to install 30 MW hybrid capacity through PPA in India. At TCE Group, CCU plant is capable of capturing 
and producing up to 40,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year. In addition to above, the Company has 
implemented energy efficiency measures across our operations to reduce our energy consumption and lower 
our carbon emissions. In 2023, the Company has completed a comprehensive energy audit and identified 
several areas where the Company could improve energy efficiency, including upgrading our equipment, 
optimising our manufacturing processes, and improving insulation. Additionally, the Company is constantly 
evaluating new technologies such as Mechanical vapour recompression and electric calcination to optimise 
energy utilisation further.

recycling and reuse of waste oil in the CRS dryer, fly ash utilisation, the waste generated within the plant gets consumed in our 
Cement plant as input material and hence the Company producing the value-added product out of waste. Spent acids are 
sent for recycling to authorised end user to make useful products. Aqueous/Organic waste is sent to the authorised common 
incinerator system. As per the Company's policy, the production of the highly toxic red triangle products as per the Insecticides 
Act has been discontinued. Thus, the product portfolio and waste generated remains relatively less toxic. Non-toxic wastewater 
from process, canteen, amenities, cooling towers, boiler blow-down, etc. is treated in Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP). ETP is 
equipped with primary, secondary, tertiary treatment followed by an Reverse Osmosis (RO) system. Tertiary treated effluent 
is either recycled through RO or discharged to the common effluent system. The Aqueous effluent generated from processes 
having low COD and high TDS is fed to the Multiple Effect Evaporator and condensate of the evaporator is sent for treatment in 
the Effluent treatment plant or recycled/reused. The sludge generated from the evaporator/ETP is sent to an authorised secured 
landfill site. High calorific and high TDS value hazardous waste is sent for processing to authorised co-processors and further to 
cement industry.

VSDs at new 
Boiler
Installed Variable Speed Drives (VSDs) in our new boiler leading to 
remarkable energy savings and environmental benefits.
The implementation of VSDs in our boilers has allowed us to optimise 
energy consumption by dynamically adjusting motor speeds to match 
varying load demands. Moreover, the reduction in energy consumption 
directly translates to a reduction in our carbon emissions. By embracing 
such sustainable practices, we are aligning our operations with our 
environmental goals and demonstrating our commitment to sustainable 
business practices.
This installation of VSDs

Effective use of 120# steam for 2 Nos of quadruple units at MUW and 
plugging the unwanted steam leakages.
MUW 3 Plant is being relocated as a part of upcoming Soda Ash Expansion 
site clearance. MUW 3 Plant consists of mainly 6 No’s of evaporators 
and several other process equipment to produce iodized vacuum salt. 
New set up is being installed beside existing unit and shall be operated 
by Central Control Room of MUW 4. MUW 3 has one double effect 
evaporator set up commissioned in Year 2011. While relocation we shall 
be converting to triple effect configuration by addition of one complete 
set of new evaporator. The double effect to triple effect Reconfiguration 
will help in increasing throughput and improve specific steam (energy) 
consumption.
These initiatives have not only led to tangible steam savings but also 
contributed significantly to reducing our carbon footprint. By embracing 
sustainable practices and leveraging technology-driven solutions, 
we are not only mitigating environmental impact but also enhancing 
operational resilience and cost-effectiveness.

Biodiversity 
Enrichment 
Program At 
Mithapur
Mithapur shelters a fascinating diversity of flora and fauna, some of which 
are either vulnerable, threatened or endangered. It is with an aim to 
further enrich this biodiversity and to strengthen the existing ecosystems 
that Tata Chemicals has embarked on a Biodiversity Enrichment Program.
Over half a mile long embankment along the seawater intake creek has 
been constructed using waste generated from soda ash process and 
work for development of plantation taken-up. 30 flora species native to 
Saurashtra region have been propagated here. An exclusive plantation 
of Piloo (Salvadora persica), a much-favoured tree for nesting by native 
waterbirds, has been developed with an aim to encourage these birds 
to start nesting here. Local grasses and herbs have been propagated 
as ground flora to ensure that the site blends well with the existing 
ecosystem. The combination of ground flora, shrubs and trees has been 
done such that it provides feeding, roosting and nesting site for birds. 
The endangered Guggul plant (Commiphora weighty) and other local 
plants of medicinal value have also been propagated.
The coral reef here sustains 
28 species of hard corals 
and a rich association of 
marine life. The number 
of bird species recorded 
here has been on a steady 
rise and has crossed well 
over the 150 mark. Nilgai, 
Sambar, Jackal, Stripped 
Hyena, Pangolin, Desert Cat 
are amongst the wild fauna 
species found here.

PRINCIPLE 9: Businesses should engage with and provide value to their consumers in a responsible manner
Essential Indicators
1. 	
Describe the mechanisms in place to receive and respond to consumer complaints and feedback.
	
The Company has web-enabled online customer complaint portal. After logging of each complaint unique number is generated 
- depending on the product group, nature of complaint. It goes to the resolution authority online. Based on resolution it goes 
to the approving authority. Once the approving authority approves and if there are any financial implications then it goes to 
commercial for issue of credit note. Once approved customer gets credit and customer feedback on the nature of closure. All 
complaints are resolved within definite timeframes depending upon the products and nature of complaint. If not resolved, then 
it escalates to next authority mapped in the system. After receiving satisfactory feedback from customer, the individual complaint 
is closed. For improvement and avoid recurrence, list of complaints is aggregated, Root cause analysis done by the assigned 
teams and aggregated reports on complaint received and closure time reported to Senior Management on monthly basis.

Inherent limitations in preparing the ISI
The preparation of the company’s BRSR information requires the management to establish or interpret the criteria, make determinations 
about the relevancy of information to be included, and make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported information. 
Measurement of certain amounts and BRSR Core metrics, some of which are estimates, is subject to substantial inherent measurement 
uncertainty, for example, GHG emissions, water footprint, energy footprint. Obtaining sufficient appropriate evidence to support our 
opinion/conclusion does not reduce the uncertainty in the amounts and metrics.
Our responsibilities
We are responsible for:
•	
Planning and performing the engagement to obtain reasonable assurance on the sustainability disclosures in the BRSR Core 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, in accordance with the Reporting Criteria in line with the 
section above.
•	
Forming an independent opinion, based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, and
•	
Reporting our reasonable assurance opinion to the Directors of Tata Chemicals Limited.
Exclusions
Our assurance scope excludes the following and therefore we will not express a conclusion on the same:
•	
Operations of the Company other than those mentioned in the “Scope of Assurance”.
•	
Aspects of the BRSR and the data/information (qualitative or quantitative) other than the ISI.
•	
Data and information outside the defined reporting period i.e., 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024.
•	
The statements that describe expression of opinion, belief, aspiration, expectation, aim, or future intentions provided by 
the Company.
Summary of the work we performed as the basis for our conclusion
We exercised professional judgment and maintained professional skepticism throughout the engagement. We designed and 
performed our procedures to obtain evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our reasonable assurance opinion. 
The nature, timing, and extent of the procedures selected depended on our judgment, including an assessment of the risks of material 
misstatement of the information subject to reasonable assurance, whether due to fraud or error. We identified and assessed the risks of 
material misstatement through understanding the Information subject to reasonable assurance and the engagement circumstances. 
We also obtained an understanding of the internal control relevant to the information subject to reasonable assurance in order to 
design procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness 
of internal controls. In carrying out our engagement, we: 
•	
assessed the suitability of the criteria used by the company in preparing the reasonable assurance information;
•	
evaluated the appropriateness of reporting policies, quantification methods and models used in the preparation of the 
information subject to reasonable assurance and the reasonableness of estimates made by the company; and
•	
evaluated the overall presentation of the information subject to reasonable assurance.

Reviews of Financial Statements, or Other Assurance or Related Services Engagements, issued by the IAASB. This standard requires the 
firm to design, implement and operate a system of quality management, including policies or procedures regarding compliance with 
ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion.
Other information
Management and the Board of Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included 
in the Company’s Annual Report (but does not include the select BRSR and GRI attributes and assurance report thereon).
Additionally, we have performed a reasonable assurance engagement on SEBI BRSR Core attributes and issued an independent assurance 
report on 2 June 2024.
Our report thereon is included with the other information.
Our limited assurance opinion on the ISI does not extend to other information that accompanies or contains the ‘ISI and our assurance 
report’ (hereafter referred to as “other information”). We have read the other information, but we have not performed any procedures with 
respect to the other information.
Other matter
Select BRSR and GRI attributes of the Company for the year ended 31 March 2023 were assured by the previous assurance practitioner 
who had expressed an unmodified opinion on 09 June 2023.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter
Intended use or purpose
The ISI and our limited assurance report are intended for users who have reasonable knowledge of the BRSR attributes and GRI 
attributes, the reporting criteria and ISI and who have read the information in the ISI with reasonable diligence and understand that 
the ISI is prepared and assured at appropriate levels of materiality.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.
Responsibilities for Identified Sustainability Information (ISI)
The management of the company are responsible for:
•	
designing, implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation of the Identified Sustainability Information 
that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error;
•	
selecting or developing suitable criteria for preparing the Identified Sustainability Information and appropriately referring to or 
describing the criteria; and
•	
preparing the Identified Sustainability Information in accordance with the reporting criteria.
Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the reporting process for the company’s ISI.
Exclusions:
Our assurance scope excludes the following and therefore we will not express a conclusion on the same:
•	
Operations of the Company other than those mentioned in the “Scope of Assurance”.
•	
Aspects of the BRSR and GRI attributes and the data/information (qualitative or quantitative) other than the ISI.
•	
Data and information outside the defined reporting period i.e., 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024.

Inherent limitations
The preparation of the company’s sustainability information requires the management to establish or interpret the criteria, 
make determinations about the relevancy of information to be included, and make estimates and assumptions that affect the 
reported information.
Measurement of certain amounts and BRSR and GRI attributes, some of which are estimates, is subject to substantial inherent 
measurement uncertainty, for example GHG emissions, water footprint, energy footprint. Obtaining sufficient appropriate evidence 
to support our opinion/conclusion does not reduce the uncertainty in the amounts and metrics.
Our responsibilities
We are responsible for:
•	
planning and performing the engagement to obtain a limited assurance about whether the ISI is free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error;
•	
forming an independent conclusion, based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained; and
•	
reporting our conclusion to the Directors of TCL.
Summary of the work we performed as the basis for our conclusion
We exercised professional judgement and maintained professional skepticism throughout the engagement. We designed and 
performed our procedures to obtain evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for limited assurance conclusion.
Limited assurance conclusion
Our procedures selected depended on our understanding of the information subject to limited assurance and other engagement 
circumstances, and our consideration of areas where material misstatements are likely to arise. In carrying out our engagement, we:
•	
assessed the suitability of the criteria used by the company in preparing the information subject to limited assurance;
•	
interviewed senior management and relevant staff at corporate and selected locations concerning policies for occupational 
health and safety, and the implementation of these across the business;
•	
through inquiries, obtained an understanding of TCL’s control environment, processes and information systems relevant to the 
preparation of the information subject to limited assurance, but did not evaluate the design of particular control activities, obtain 
evidence about their implementation or test their operating effectiveness;
•	
made inquiries of relevant staff at corporate and selected locations responsible for the preparation of the Information subject 
to limited assurance;
•	
undertook all site visits out of which Six were physical site visits and five were virtual site visits; we selected these sites based on 
the relative size of the workforce of these locations to the total workforce, unexpected fluctuations in the information subject 
to limited assurance since the prior period, and sites not visited in the prior period;
•	
inspected, at each site visited, a limited number of items to or from supporting records, as appropriate;
•	
applied analytical procedures, as appropriate;
•	
recalculated the information subject to limited assurance based on the criteria; and
•	
evaluated the overall presentation of the information subject to limited assurance to determine whether it is consistent with 
the criteria and in line with our overall knowledge of, and experience with, the company’s occupational health and safety.
The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a 
reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially 
lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed.
