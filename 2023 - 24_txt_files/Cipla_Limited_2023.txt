Any products that remain unsold in the market and 
approach their end of life for any reason are retrieved 
by our warehouses for secure disposal, typically 
through incineration.

products are sent for safe disposal through incineration. 
We do use recycled tertiary packaging material 
sourced from our suppliers. We also collect and 
channelise quantities of different types of plastics such 
as rigid, flexible and multi-layered which is equivalent 
to that used in packing our own products.

and 252 metric tonnes of packaging material was 
sent for recycling.

are sent for safe disposal through incineration.
However, 100% equivalent amount of pre and post-
consumer plastic waste is collected through waste 
management agency and co-processed, recycled 
and/or converted to energy.
9.40% of our formulation products were reclaimed and 
safely disposed through incineration in FY 2023-24.

A detailed framework and guidelines have been provided 
in Cipla's Business Continuity Plan guidance document 
to support Cipla’s business units and operations to 
respond, restore and check critical business processes 
when normal operations are disrupted. This document 
provides an overview of ongoing functions, describes 
an approach to supporting critical business functions 
and defines personal roles and responsibilities. It also 
outlines notification procedures and communication 
methods, protocols for activation deactivation plans, 
provisions for alternative workplaces/manufacturing/
product development and a plan for the maintenance 
and recovery of important records.
 
This document contains BCP guidelines to respond to 
outages caused by natural, technical and man-made 
events, as well as events that cause loss of access 
to parts or the entire facility or loss of service due to 
failure of equipment or systems. The effect of the above 
disruptive events can lead to the realisation of risks in 
main risk categories i.e. Environmental, health and safety 
(‘EHS’) and business/financial risks. The BCP guidelines 
provide a framework for addressing these EHS and 
business/financial risks. BCP guidelines\apply to Cipla, 
its subsidiaries and affiliates. Additionally, every Cipla 
location has an on-site emergency response plan.
 
Furthermore, due to the variability of disruptions, from 
time to time, business functions may define specific 
business continuity/ risk mitigation plans which are taken 
with due consideration toward risks involved and are 
subject to cross-functional deliberations and approvals.
