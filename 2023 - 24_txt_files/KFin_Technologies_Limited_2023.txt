Financial implications of 
the risk or opportunity 
(Indicate positive or 
negative implications)
1
Carbon  
Footprint  
and Climate  
Change
Risk and  
Opportunity
The Company could 
face risks from stricter 
regulations, reputational 
damage, higher costs, and 
operational disruptions due 
to climate change and energy 
price volatility.
As an opportunity, the 
Company can benefit from 
market differentiation, 
cost savings, innovation, 
attracting ESG investments, 
and appealing to 
environmentally conscious 
customers and employees 
by embracing sustainable 
practices and reducing its 
carbon footprint.
The Company can shift to 
renewable energy sources 
for powering data centres 
and other facilities, reducing 
carbon emissions and 
energy consumption. Also, 
implementing energy-
efficient technologies, such 
as efficient cooling systems 
and server virtualization, 
could lead to reduced 
energy usage.
Negative implications of risk 
could include potential fines, 
increased operational and 
insurance costs, revenue 
loss from reputational 
damage, and higher 
expenses due to supply 
chain disruptions.
Positive implications can 
include cost savings due 
to lower energy bills and 
operational efficiency, 
increased revenue due to 
market differentiation, and 
attracting ESG investments.
2
Electronic  
Waste
Risk
Stricter disposal and 
recycling regulations, 
reporting requirements, 
reputational damage and 
increased stakeholder 
expectations demanding 
responsible E-waste 
management practices.
The Company has endorsed 
a robust and established 
Waste Management Policy 
specifically focused on 
E-waste. Under this policy, 
we have partnered with 
approved vendors who 
specialise in the appropriate 
disposal of electronic waste.
Non-compliance with 
E-waste handling rules can 
result in financial penalties.
3
Data Privacy 
and Security
Risk 
and opportunity
As a QRTA, the Company 
handles sensitive customer 
data. Ensuring robust 
data privacy and security 
measures is crucial to 
maintaining customer 
trust and compliance with 
relevant regulations.
The Company has 
implemented strong data 
protection controls including 
encryption, access control 
mechanisms, and employee 
training programs, to mitigate 
the risk of data breaches and 
compromise of data privacy.
Increased investment 
in robust controls can 
build and maintain trust 
with customers, leading 
to increased loyalty and 
long-term relationships. The 
identified risk, if not resolved 
could lead to fines or 
penalties, loss of customers, 
reputational damage, etc. 
4
Workforce  
Diversity &  
Inclusion
Opportunity
A diverse and inclusive 
workforce can lead to 
enhanced creativity and 
innovation, better decision 
making, increased employee 
engagement and retention, 
attracting top talent, 
positive organisational 
culture and a socially 
responsible organisation.
The Company is an equal 
opportunity employer and 
does not discriminate its 
workforce on any grounds.  
Improved financial 
performance on account 
of broader market reach, 
improved reputation and 
brand loyalty.
5
Employee  
Well-being
Opportunity
A safe and healthy 
work environment, 
work-life balance, and 
employee development 
opportunities are essential 
for employee satisfaction, 
productivity, and overall 
organizational success.
Prioritise employee well- 
being through initiatives like 
flexible work arrangements, 
mental health support, 
employee benefits/ 
facilities and professional 
development opportunities.
Improving employee 
well-being and creating an 
inclusive work environment 
can enhance productivity, 
reduce employee turnover, 
attract top talent leading to 
increased revenues.

Annual Report 2023-24
KFintech. 
Consequently, 
KCPL's 
existing 
equity investment in a foreign entity viz. KFin 
Technologies (Malaysia) Sdn. Bhd., amounting 
to MYR 400,000 and USD 149,500 (totalling 
approx. MYR 1,000,000), was transferred to 
the applicant. However, since KFintech was 
a newly incorporated entity, it was unable to 
fulfil the criterion of having posted net profits 
for three financial years prior to such ODl 
(acquisition of stake in the foreign entity), 
under the extant framework governing ODl 
by Indian Parties in financial services sector. 
The lapse was taken on record by RBl, subject 
to compounding and compounding fee was 
imposed. The compounding fees were duly
