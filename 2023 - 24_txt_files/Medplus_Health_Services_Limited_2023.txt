Waste

R
It is crucial for MedPlus to

Energy use

impacts in 
Retail
R
With 
thousands 
of 
retail 
pharmacies, distribution centers, 
offices, 
and 
other 
facilities 
across the country, MedPlus run 
numerous establishments that 
consume  energy, mainly for 
lighting and refrigeration. The 
continuous operation of several 
of these retail locations further 
escalates energy demand. Most 
of this energy is being consumed 
through 
conventional 
grids 
running 
on 
non-renewable 
sources resulting in emission and 
climate change.
The 
company 
procures 
energy-efficient 
electrical 
equipment and has begun 
to replace all lighting with 
energy-efficient LED lights. 
The 
Company 
is 
always 
monitoring and looking for 
ways to reduce energy use 
across its network.

Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report (Contd.)
Governance, leadership and oversight

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related 
challenges, targets and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this 
disclosure)
	
Dear Stakeholders,
	
MedPlus is deeply committed to ensuring that its operations and practices are sustainable, inclusive, and 
responsible. We are firm believers that businesses must have a purpose other than profit, which includes 
environmental and social responsibilities. This concept serves as the cornerstone for our commitment 
to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles, which help us create long-term value for our 
stakeholders. We are aware of our industry's sustainability problems, particularly in terms of energy use, 
waste output, and emissions. However, we see these problems as opportunities to innovate, grow, and 
inspire change, not only inside our firm, but throughout the industry and society as a whole.
	
We have made several initiatives to reduce our environmental effect. A primary aim has been to improve 
energy efficiency throughout our operations. We have begun the conversion of our traditional lighting to 
LED alternatives and will continue to invest in very energy-efficient equipment. We have also enhanced 
the administration of our air conditioning systems, ensuring that they are turned off when not in use. 
These solutions have already resulted in significant energy savings. Our commitment to sustainability 
extends to how we handle and reduce waste. We have put in place mechanisms to collect, manage, and 
recycle waste appropriately, and we are working with approved entities to do so.
	
We have also made steps to limit plastic waste, switching to paper bags in our stores and reusable cloth bags 
in our warehouses. Our trash reduction activities are yielding great results. Furthermore, we redesigned our 
supply chain to make it more efficient and localized. By procuring items from permitted local producers 
and carefully placing our warehouses, we have successfully reduced the distance things must be carried, 
resulting in lower fuel usage and emissions. As we continue on our sustainable path, we've worked with 
stakeholders to identify material topics, started emission calculations, and implemented environmental, 
health, and safety standards throughout the firm. Our dedication to our employees' wellbeing remains 
unshakable, as evidenced by rigorous health and safety procedures throughout our businesses.
	
In the future, we hope to deepen our market penetration, develop our omnichannel presence, boost private 
offers, provide customers with complementary services, and automate back-end operations. All of these 
actions maintain our commitment to sustainability while providing genuine medicines at a better value 
to clients. Our recent diagnostics investment broadens our service offerings, allowing us to lay a solid 
platform for long-term growth. While we are proud of our accomplishments, we recognize that there is 
much more work to be done. Sustainability is a journey, not a destination. We remain consistent in our 
commitment to continuously improving our methods, establishing more ambitious goals, and paving the 
way for sustainable and responsible business.
	
Thank you for your ongoing support and trust in MedPlus as we embark on a journey towards a sustainable 
future.

laws to ensure the safety and sustainability of its products, and it is constantly looking for methods to 
improve the lifecycle of these products. While there are no formal methods for sustainable sourcing, 
the Company actively seeks to reduce waste in product procurement (finished goods), based on 
what pharmaceutical and FMCG industries supply. The procurement procedure mostly entails 
bulk purchasing from vendors in their original packaging, with no requirement for extra supplies. 
The company runs an optimized end-to-end supply chain that saves gasoline and resources.

MedPlus's ongoing goal is to improve energy efficiency, reduce waste, and reduce fuel usage across our 
broad network of retail locations. We remain steadfast in our goal to reducing our carbon impact through 
various approaches, including:
	
Optimizing Energy Efficiency: We have launched an initiative to replace traditional lighting with 
LED alternatives and invest in very energy efficient equipment. In addition, we actively manage our air 
conditioning systems, ensuring that they are turned off in areas that are not in use. We've carefully located 
our warehouses in major urban regions. These decentralized facilities conduct procurement autonomously 
and use public transportation to serve stores in nearby Tier 1 and Tier II cities or towns. This strategy 
encourages lower energy use by reducing the distance of transportation.

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24
	
Waste Management and Reduction: Various measures have been implemented for collection, 
management and recycling of general waste as well as pharmaceutical responsibly, and we are partnering 
with authorized agencies for the same to keep emissions at bay. Our focus extends to the minimization of 
plastic waste as we use paper bags at our stores and reusable cloth bags at our warehouse facilities. 
	
Efficient and Localized Supply Chain: Our goods are sourced from authorized local producers of FMCG 
and Pharmaceutical products. Our procurement strategy includes sourcing from seven strategic locations 
close to vendor points, which aids us in efficiently distributing products to our retail outlets. Our end-to-
end supply chain, running from our central warehouse to the retail shops, has been streamlined to ensure 
maximum efficiency. This optimized system enables us to reduce fuel usage and resource wastage 
significantly.
