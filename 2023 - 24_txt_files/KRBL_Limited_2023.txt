1.
Product Quality 
and Safety
 R
KRBL operates in the food and agriculture sector. Product 
quality and safety are critical material ESG (Environmental, 
Social, and Governance) risks that the Company addresses 
regularly because of the following reasons:
Consumer Health and Safety: Consumer health and safety 
are core ethical values for our business. The Company's 
products are consumed by individuals worldwide, and it 
remains steadfast in its dedication to delivering products 
that consistently uphold rigorous standards of quality 
and safety. KRBL is diligently advancing its operational 
standards within its Units. While Hazard Analysis and Critical 
Control Points (HACCP) practices are already integral to 
our systems, we are now augmenting our protocols with 
the implementation of Vulnerability Assessment and 
Critical Control Points (VACCP) and Threat Assessment 
and Critical Control Points (TACCP). These initiatives 
concentrate specifically on mitigating risks associated 
with food fraud and fortifying food defense measures. 
These strategies entail rigorous risk assessments that 
meticulously evaluate potential threats and vulnerabilities 
across the entirety of our supply chain.
Supply Chain Risks: KRBL  procures paddy from the APMC 
Mandis, and any issues related to the quality of the paddy/
rice procured can impact the quality of the final product. 
Thus ensuring that the Company continues to source rice 
from suppliers based on superior grain quality is important. 
KRBL  maintains a sophisticated Transport Management 
System (TMS) as part of its supply chain management 
framework. This software-driven system enables real-
time tracking of vehicles, ensuring seamless planning, 
execution, and optimization of the physical transportation 
of goods, both inbound and outbound. Through the 
TMS, KRBL ensures compliance with regulations and the 
availability of accurate documentation throughout the 
shipment process.
In order to meet product quality and safety 
requirements, the company has ensured 
compliance 
with 
various 
certifications 
standards: 
•	
FSSC 22000 Version 5.1 issued by Eurofins
•	
SQF Food Safety Code for Manufacturing 
Edition 9 issued by Eurofins
•	
BRC Global Standard for Food Safety Issue 
9 Certification issued by Eurofins
•	
Halal Certification issued by M/s. Halal 
Certification Services India Pvt Ltd.
•	
KRBL’s Unit is SEDEX registered.
•	
One of the Unit has completed BRCGS 
ETRS (Ethical Trade and Responsible 
Sourcing) assessment with a score of 5/5.

Reputation: KRBL 's reputation is critical to its success, and 
any adverse news related to the quality and safety of its 
products can affect its brand reputation, which can have 
long-term negative effects on the business. As a company 
that exports its products worldwide, KRBL  ensures that it 
meets international quality and safety standards to maintain 
its reputation as a premium Basmati rice-brand. At KRBL, 
we benefit from strategic alliances with prominent industry 
bodies such as PHD, which provide invaluable support and 
advocacy in addressing issues related to industry.
2.
Ethics and 
Governance
O
Good ethics and governance practices improve overall 
company performance and boost consumer confidence. 
This has been categorized as an opportunity because of 
the following reasons:
Reputation and Brand Value: By ensuring that its business 
practices are transparent, ethical and compliant with local 
and international laws and regulations, KRBL is able to 
enhance its reputation and brand value, which would lead 
to increased customer loyalty and trust.
Competitive Advantage: Companies that prioritize ethics 
and governance in their business practices are more 
likely to gain a competitive advantage, as they are better 
positioned to attract investors, customers and employees 
who prioritize ethical and sustainable business practices.
Risk Mitigation: By implementing robust governance 
structures and policies, KRBL  mitigates risks related 
to unethical practices, such as corruption and conflicts 
of interest, which can lead to legal, financial and 
reputational damage. KRBL  has implemented the AMS 
(Artwork Management System), this system implements a 
streamlined workflow for the approval of artwork designs. 
The system facilitates collaboration and ensure that 
all necessary approvals are obtained before artwork is 
finalized. It also serves as a centralized repository for all 
approved artwork files. This makes it easy to access and 
retrieve artwork designs when needed for compliance 
audits or regulatory inquiries.

Improved Stakeholder Engagement: By prioritizing ethics 
and governance, KRBL  improves stakeholder engagement 
and builds stronger relationships with investors, customers, 
and other stakeholders, which would lead to increased 
collaboration, innovation and growth. KRBL  has also 
implemented the DataKart system for the management 
and generation of barcodes and QR codes. The software 
acts as a medium to directly share product information 
with consumers through mobile application. Furthermore, 
it serves as a comprehensive repository for all barcodes 
and master data.
Long-term Sustainability: By focusing on ethics and 
governance, KRBL  ensures long-term sustainability of 
its business by reducing risks, enhancing reputation and 
building a culture of trust and transparency.
3.
Responsible 
Marketing and 
Communication
O
KRBL  ships products across the world and brand 
communication influences consumer decisions Hence, 
has been categorized as an opportunity because of the 
following reasons
Consumer Trust: By adopting responsible marketing 
and communication practices, KRBL  is able to build trust 
with consumers, leading to increased loyalty and repeat 
purchases. Consumers are increasingly conscious of the 
impact of their purchasing decisions on the environment 
and society, and companies that prioritize responsible 
marketing and communication can attract and retain these 
consumers.
Reputation 
and 
Brand 
Value: 
By 
communicating 
transparently and responsibly about its products and 
business practices, KRBL  enhances its reputation and 
brand value, leading to increased customer loyalty, 
investor confidence, and stakeholder trust.
Social and Environmental Impact: Responsible marketing 
and communication help KRBL  showcase its positive 
impact on society and the environment, such as its efforts to 
promote sustainable agriculture practices and support local 
farmers. This can enhance its social license to operate and 
attract socially responsible investors.
Legal 
and 
Regulatory 
Compliance: 
By 
adopting 
responsible marketing and communication practices, KRBL 
ensures compliance with local and international laws and 
regulations related to advertising, labelling and product 
claims, reducing the risk of legal and financial liabilities.

4.
Health, Safety 
and Well-Being
R
KRBL  ensures highest level of health and safety through 
its production process by identifying Health, Safety and 
Well-Being as a key material risk for the following reasons:
Employee Well-being: KRBL 's employees are its most 
valuable asset, and their well-being is crucial to the 
company's success. A safe and healthy work environment 
will lead to decreased employee turnover, increased 
productivity and enhanced brand reputation.
Occupational Health and Safety: KRBL's operations 
involve various risks such as machinery hazards, chemical 
exposure and physical strain.
We 
have 
undertaken 
the 
following 
risk 
mitigation measures:
•	
KRBL has in place a Standard Operating 
Procedure for Operational Rescue Measure 
to ensure business continuity and the safety 
of employees. KRBL  has also conducted 
risk assessments in manufacturing units 
pertaining to building risks, changes in 
building, transmittable diseases and risks 
related to pregnant women.
•	
First aid room available with trained first 
aiders.
Negative
Supply Chain Risks: KRBL  sources its raw materials from 
various suppliers, and proper health and safety practices 
across their operations would lead to decreased risks 
of supply chain disruptions, product recalls and legal 
liabilities.
Community Health and Safety: KRBL's production 
processes can also have an impact on the health and 
safety of the surrounding communities. 
Regulatory Compliance: Non-compliance with health and 
safety regulations can result in legal and financial liabilities 
for KRBL, leading to reputational damage and financial 
losses.
In conclusion, health, safety, and well-being can be seen 
as a material ESG risk for KRBL, leading to potential risks 
such as occupational hazards, community health risks, 
supply chain risks, and legal and financial liabilities. By 
prioritizing health, safety and well-being in its operations 
and supply chain, KRBL mitigates these risks and ensures 
the sustainability of its business.
•	
Proper PPE kits have been provided to 
workers
•	
Relevant safety equipment such as gloves, 
safety shoes, ear plugs, helmets etc. have 
been provided to workers
•	
Trainings and mock drills on emergency 
preparedness and use of fire extinguisher

•	
For safe disposal of waste (used oils)

through an external waste management 
agency.
•	
For lifts, Annual Maintenance Contract with 
Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM)

5.
Climate Change
R
Climate Change have been categorized as a risk since 
KRBL's operations involve various emissions such as 
greenhouse gases, particulate matter, and volatile organic 
compounds, which can have adverse effects on the 
environment and public health. The company also relies 
on fossil fuels for energy generation, which can contribute 
to climate change. Failure to address emissions can lead 
to adverse living conditions for society and accelerated 
climate-change. Addressing emission concerns timely 
helps us stay ahead of increased regulatory scrutiny, 
reputational damage and financial losses.
Water has also been categorised as a risk since KRBL’s 
operations are highly dependent on water which can 
adverse the fresh water consumption. As a prominent 
rice manufacturer, KRBL's cultivation of paddy requires 
considerable water usage, contributing to environmental 
water scarcity concerns. The company's dependence 
on water resources highlights the urgent need to adopt 
sustainable water management strategies.
•	
At KRBL Dhuri and GB Nagar, our 
manufacturing processes are powered 
primarily by rice husk, serving as a 
sustainable alternative to traditional fossil 
fuels thus, reducing the overall dependency 
on grid electricity. This strategic utilization 
significantly mitigates our reliance on 
non-renewable 
energy 
sources, 
while 
concurrently reducing our carbon footprint, 
owing to the superior energy-to-emission 
ratio of rice husk compared to conventional 
options.
•	
We are also currently undertaking the 
commissioning of an additional turbine 
at one of our units at Ghaziabad with the 
objective of eliminating reliance on grid 
electricity. 
•	
The power factor (PF) serves as a crucial 
metric for assessing energy efficiency. KRBL 
consistently achieves a commendable 
power factor ranging from 0.98 to 0.99 in 
both the manufacturing units to enhance

of waste, such as agricultural waste, packaging waste 
and wastewater, which can have adverse environmental 
impacts. By adopting sustainable waste management 
practices, KRBL  reduces its environmental footprint, 
conserves resources, and minimizes waste disposal 
costs. Sustainable waste management can also enhance 
KRBL 's reputation as a responsible and environmentally 
conscious company, leading to increased stakeholder 
trust and support. By prioritizing waste management, KRBL 
is able to align its business operations with sustainable 
development goals, drive long-term growth and contribute 
to a more sustainable future.

24. This achievement has been facilitated 
through collaborative efforts with waste 
pickers, collection centers and recycling/
co-processing 
facilities, 
all 
operating 
synergistically. Given the primary focus of 
the Company on food grains, plastic serves

initiatives such as supporting local farmers, investing 
in community development programs and engaging 
with stakeholders to address community concerns. By 
prioritizing sustainable community operations, KRBL  aligns 
its business operations with sustainable development 
goals, fosters positive relationships with its stakeholders, 
and contributes to the social and economic development

GOVERNANCE, LEADERSHIP AND OVERSIGHT
7.	
Statement by Director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets 
and achievements
	
At KRBL Limited, sustainability forms the core of our business operations. We recognize our obligation to lead the way in sustainable 
progress, viewing it as more than just a social responsibility. Consistently aligning our business strategies with sustainability 
and circularity, we ensure that these principles permeate every facet of our operations. Our resolute mission is to minimise 
our ecological footprint and make a positive impact on the environment. Beyond environmental care, we invest in community 
wellbeing and social inclusion, empowering them to thrive. We are shaping a better, sustainable tomorrow, integrating social and 
environmental factors into our operations and decisions. We are committed to upholding the ESG Principles and are pleased with 
the progress we have achieved towards a sustainable and socially responsible future.
	
Our primary challenge is reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and grid electricity. Socially, we focus on ethical trade, responsible 
sourcing, ensuring employee safety and training, and maintaining high standards of customer satisfaction and governance standards.
	
We live today in a world of uncertainty. Unprecedented change is upon us given the mega threats of geopolitical dynamics, existential 
climate crisis and digital acceleration. The consequences are starkly visible be it in supply chain disruptions, structural inflation, the 
danger of food and livelihood security and indeed widening inequality. KRBL firmly beliefs that businesses exist to serve society. 
Enterprises with their immense and multi-dimensional resources can play a significant role in alleviating societal challenges.
	
KRBL’s initiatives and action plan includes pursuing a low carbon growth strategy through extensive decarbonisation programmes 
across its operations and value chain, increasing the share of renewable energy, energy efficiency initiatives and use of technology 
for greening logistics. Accelerating adaptation efforts, KRBL is building climate resilience by promoting regenerative agriculture 
practices in agriculture. This will further strengthen efforts to combat climate change, enable the transition to a net zero economy, 
work towards ensuring water security for all, restore biodiversity through adoption of nature-based solutions, create an effective 
circular economy for post-consumer packaging waste and scale up programmes that support large-scale sustainable livelihoods.
	
We continue to strengthen our management approach, guided by a comprehensive set of sustainability policies. We are also building 
further on the mechanisms of engagement with key stakeholders, identifying material sustainability issues and progressively 
monitoring and mitigating the impact along our value chains. Focussed interventions have been strengthened in key areas of 
impact such as talent management, diversity & inclusion, employee relations and employee well-being. We will continue to update 
our systems and processes in line with evolving disclosure standards and Environmental, Social and Governance requirements.
	
The journey towards decarbonisation in KRBL includes increasing our footprint of renewable energy, green infrastructure and 
carbon sequestration amongst others. This includes reusing by-products like rice husk across operations and recycling waste, 
making the concept of circularity central to conducting business at KRBL Limited.  During the year, around 90% of our total energy 
requirements for plant operations were met from renewable sources. Our energy portfolio includes 112.25 MW in wind power, 
17 MW in solar projects, and 17.59 MW in biomass segments. We aim to further reduce energy consumption, water withdrawal 
and replenish 137,210 KL of water annually through recharge wells.

Recognising that it is critical to prevent waste from reaching landfills, KRBL has put in place comprehensive interventions for solid, 
plastic waste management. Through Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR), we collected, recycled, and safely disposed of over 
2,600 tonnes of plastic waste in FY 2023-24 and reduced plastic usage by 10 metric tons in FY 2024. By FY 2025-26 we aim to 
use 30% of recycled plastics in Category 1 (PET jars) and 10% in Category 2 (Flexible packaging).
	
KRBL’s biodiversity programme focusses on reviving ecosystem services provided to agriculture such as natural regulation of 
pests, pollination, nutrient cycling, soil health retention and genetic diversity, which have witnessed considerable erosion over the 
past few decades. We have designated 3000 sq. m for Miyawaki plantation to lower urban temperatures and reduce pollution. 
Eucalyptus Plantation: We have planted 20,000 Eucalyptus trees across 30 acres to mitigate groundwater seepage and promote 
natural discharge.
	
We firmly believe that there is no conflict between creation of shareholder value and generation of societal capital as we continue 
to make strides towards the sustainability.

on Business and Human Rights. One of the Manufacturing Unit of KRBL is certified by SEDEX (Supplier Ethical Data Exchange) 
and conducts BRCGS ETRS (British Retail Consortium Global Standards) Ethical Trade Responsible assessment which makes 
KRBL, the first organization in rice industry to be ETRS assessed with a 5/5 score. We support fair labour practices, safe 
working conditions and respect for human rights throughout our supply chain. We also monitor our raw material and packaging 
material suppliers on social compliance parameters. Further, we follow Ethical Trading Initiative Code in our manufacturing 
plants. The Company has a Sustainable Sourcing Policy in place and it endeavours to procure raw materials and packaging 
materials from the suppliers who are doing their respective businesses sustainably.

possible. Given our business operations, it is difficult to estimate the percentage of inputs sourced sustainably. However, the 
suppliers have made efforts to abide by all provisions relating to the impact on quality and food safety, sustainability, waste, 
and work environment which includes aspects of ethical labour practices and human rights.

Extended Producer 
Responsibility 
As part of our Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR), we collect plastic waste 
through our waste management agency and recycle or safely dispose it as 
appropriate. We comply with EPR regulations set by the Central Pollution Control 
Board (CPCB). Since 2019, we have been a plastic-neutral* organization and have 
successfully met EPR guidelines yearly.
E-Waste
Extended Producer 
Responsibility
At KRBL, we have managed generation of electronic waste (e-waste), ensuring that 
all such waste is conscientiously recycled and safely disposed of through accredited 
e-waste processing facilities.

Toxic and hazardous wastes are managed in strict accordance with guidelines of 
Pollution Control Board (PCB). This ensures safe and environmentally friendly 
disposal, mitigating potential risks to ecosystems and public health.

Yes, KRBL is in compliance with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) under the applicable Plastic Waste Management rules. 
Through EPR, the Company has made an attempt to collect, recycle or safely dispose more than 2600 tonnes of plastic waste. This 
has been made possible by efficient collaboration with collection centres and recycling/co-processing plants. The primary product 
of the Company is food grains, hence plastic is the predominant packaging material. Ensuring compliance with the Plastic Waste 
Management (PWM) Rules, 2016, the Company follows the 'Replace with EPR' approach to manage its downstream operations, 
plastic packaging waste. Further, the Company has plans to increase the use of recycled plastic in a host of product packaging. 
Our EPR plan is implemented through our Waste Management Agency ("WMA"). WMA has collected the targeted plastic waste 
across India. In alignment with EPR compliance requirements, the Company has managed Category 1 Rigid Plastic (51 MT), 
Category 2 Flexible Plastic (2227 MT), and Category 3 MLP Plastic (347 MT) during the FY 2023-24. To facilitate credit transfers 
and ensure compliance across all three plastic categories, the Company has diligently fulfilled its annual return obligations via the 
EPR portal.

Note: KRBL prioritizes environmental responsibility. We’ve revised our non-hazardous waste reporting to include rice husk ash, a by-product of our renewable 
biomass power generation. This change may show an increase compared to previous reports, but it provides a more accurate picture. Additionally, we want to 
clarify an assumption: while loading rice husk ash onto trucks for landfill, water is sprayed to keep the ash settled during transportation. This practice can result in 
inaccurate data records due to the added weight of the absorbed water. Therefore, we now calculate rice husk ash based on the residual ash approx (18%) of the 
total rice husk generated in our operations and utilized in generation of electricity
