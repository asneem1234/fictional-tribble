In case of risk, approach

Financial 
implications of the

(Indicate positive 
or negative 
implications)
1
 Wood availability
Risk / Opportunity
Risk: Since wood pulp 
constitutes the major 
portion in the pulp furnish 
for the paper manufacturing 
in the Company. Wood 
supply risk due to mismatch 
in demand & supply.
To mitigate supply 
risk associated with 
wood sourcing for 
pulp and paper, the 
Company has taken 
major initiatives 
towards Social, Farm 
and Agroforestry 
programme with local 
farm communities for a 
consistent and regular 
supply of quality wood. 
The company 
has its own well 
defined Plantation 
Development 
Strategy to increase 
massive plantation 
coverage with the 
help of marginal and 
progressive growers in 
the nearby districts. 
No negative 
financial implication 
since major 
initiatives taken 
by the Company 
will enables to be 
a Wood Positive 
company in coming 
years.
2
Coal availability & 
energy cost
Risk / Opportunity
Risk: Consistent supply of 
coal is a challenge & higher 
usage of coal increase 
energy cost.
Opportunity: Since this 
opens up avenues to move 
towards non-fossil fuel 
based energy sources.
Company has a well-
defined strategy to 
reduce its dependency 
on Coal through 
renewable energy 
sources and Biomass 
fuels like Agro-wood 
dust, bark rice husk etc. 
Neutral since 
the company is 
continuously taking 
steps to reduce 
dependency on 
Coal.
3
Unforeseen 
climatic conditions 
affecting the 
farming thereby 
restricting the 
Supply of wheat 
straw
Risk
Risk: Since wheat straw is 
a key input material for the 
company.
The Company has 
developed potential 
suppliers for a sustain 
& regular supply 
irrespective of seasons 
as they have sufficient 
storage capacity.
Low Adverse impact 
as the Company has 
substitute material 
like baggase, 
sarkanda in case 
of any shortage in 
supply of wheat 
straw.

Specific commitments, goals and targets set by 
the entity with defined timelines, if any.
The Company has a vision to reduce its Water Consumption by 35% in the next 
2 years and to increase the footprint of its Social, Farm, and Forestry program 
to 1 Crore clonal saplings in 5 years timeline. 
1. Water Conservation
At Kuantum, we recognize the importance of conserving water to protect the 
environment and ensure the sustainability of our operations. Technologies 
used at our plant to reduce freshwater consumption include the installation 
of disc filters, conical save-alls, Micro Plate Settlers (MPS) technology, white 
water clarifiers and Dissolved Air Floatation (DAF) technology. We also recycle 
hot water from heat exchangers, use Volute Press equipment technology for 
handling secondary sludge, and have installed a Triple Wire Belt Press at 
its effluent treatment plant (ETP). These initiatives have helped us to reduce 
freshwater consumption by 2500 m³/day. Conscious efforts are being made 
through various projects to further reduce freshwater consumption by 5 m³/
tonne of paper.
2. Clonal Production & Plantation- Ensuring Sustainability in the Future 
Under its visionary approach to ensure raw material sustainability, Company 
has set up a Hi-Tech clonal  nursery in its campus by newly installed Hi-Tech 
Mist Chambers , Hardening Chambers and advanced Mini Hedge Gardens with 
a current production capacity of 2 millions clonal saplings to increase the 
footprint of its Social, Farm and Agroforestry programmes to tune of 1 crore 
clonal saplings in coming 3 years’ timeline which will be covering around 12500 
acres of plantation per annum ensuring its wood positivity. 
3. Energy Conservation  
As a paper company, we understand the importance of energy conservation 
in reducing our carbon footprint and contributing to a sustainable future. The 
Company is currently operating at 28 MW co-generation power plants for 
captive use while eliminating dependency on Grid Power. To meet the demands 
of process steam, and to generate sustainable power, one high-pressure CFBC 
boiler, supplied by ISGEC, with an operating pressure of 110 Kg/cm2 and 130 
Ton/Hr steam flow has also been commissioned recently. This has helped 
Kuantum be self-sufficient for its power and steam requirements.

4. Organic Waste Recycling (Bio-Degradable)
In-house, we are doing segregation of the organic waste by taking all necessary 
health and safety precautions. We are using the compost-making machine and 
generating organic compost. Composting is a biological process during which 
naturally occurring microorganisms, bacteria, and insects break down organic 
materials such as leaves, grass clippings, and certain kitchen scraps into a soil-
like product called compost. It is a form of recycling, a natural way of returning 
needed nutrients to the soil. Compost is used to improve soil structure through the 
addition of carbon and provide plant nutrients. In addition to being a source of plant 
nutrients such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K), it improves the 
physio-chemical and biological properties of the soil.
