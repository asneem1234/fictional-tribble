1.
Environmental 
Impacts of Project 
Development
R
Environmental impact is a significant 
concern due to the nature of our projects 
involving extensive construction and 
treatment processes. Activities such 
as 
excavation, 
waste 
management, 
and chemical usage can affect local 
ecosystems, water sources, and air 
quality. Regulatory bodies enforce strict 
environmental guidelines, making it 
imperative for us to proactively manage 
these impacts. Failure to comply with 
environmental 
regulations 
during 
construction may result in costly fines 
and remediation costs, and it can 
damage an entity’s reputation.
To mitigate the environmental impacts of our 
projects, 
we 
strictly 
adhere 
to 
all 
relevant 
environmental regulations and standards, ensuring 
comprehensive compliance with local and national, 
requirements. This involves obtaining all necessary 
permits and approvals before project initiation 
to guarantee that our activities align with legal 
and 
environmental 
obligations. 
Furthermore, 
our commitment to environmental stewardship 
is reinforced by our ISO 14001 certification, 
which signifies our implementation of a robust 
Environmental Management System (EMS). This 
certification ensures that we systematically identify, 
manage, 
and 
reduce 
environmental 
impacts 
throughout the project lifecycle, continuously 
improving our practices to minimize adverse 
effects on the environment. By integrating these 
measures, we strive to achieve sustainable project 
outcomes while maintaining regulatory compliance 
and environmental responsibility.
Negative
(There were no 
negative financial 
implications for the 
FY 23-24)
2.
Structural 
Integrity & Safety
R
Errors or below par quality during the 
project design phase and construction 
of buildings or infrastructure can lead to 
substantial personal injury, diminished 
property value, and financial losses. 
Poor management of structural integrity 
and safety can result in additional 
expenses from redesigns or repairs, legal 
liabilities, and damage to the company’s 
reputation, which could impede growth 
opportunities. To mitigate these risks, 
entities should aim to meet or surpass 
evolving industry quality standards and 
establish internal controls to detect and 
address potential design flaws.
To address the risk of structural integrity and 
safety, we adhere to stringent quality management 
practices 
supported 
by 
our 
ISO 
9001:2015 
certification. This certification underscores our 
commitment 
to 
maintaining 
high 
standards 
throughout all phases of project development. 
Our Quality Management System (QMS) ensures 
that we use only the highest-quality materials and 
construction techniques, meeting or exceeding 
industry benchmarks. Rigorous quality control 
measures are implemented at every stage—from 
design and procurement to construction and 
final inspection—to verify that all materials and 
workmanship are up to the required standards. 
By adhering to these practices and leveraging 
the structured framework provided by our ISO 
9001:2015 certification, we effectively minimize the 
risk of structural failures, reduce the likelihood of 
costly redesigns or repairs, and uphold the safety 
and durability of our projects.

3.
Workforce Health 
& Safety
R
The health and safety of our workforce 
are crucial due to the hazardous 
nature of construction and treatment 
activities. Stringent labour compliance 
requirements in India require us to 
ensure 
effective 
health 
and 
safety 
measures which are necessary to prevent 
accidents.
To effectively mitigate workforce safety risks, we 
adhere to both ISO 18001:2007 and ISO 45001 
certifications, which validate our commitment to 
maintaining high standards in Occupational Health 
and Safety Management Systems (OHSMS). Safety 
is a core value at EMS Limited and plays a crucial 
role in our business operations. 
At 
all 
our 
Engineering, 
Procurement, 
and 
Construction (EPC) and Operations & Maintenance 
(O&M) sites, we implement a range of systems and 
procedures to ensure a safe working environment. 
We conduct comprehensive safety training for all 
individuals entering site premises. We ensure 
to implement a robust work permit system that 
ensures that supervisors are fully informed about 
ongoing work activities and that all necessary 
safety measures are evaluated and implemented 
before any job begins. 
In addition to these protocols, we prioritize the 
overall health and well-being of our workforce 
by providing clean and hygienic water, suitable 
accommodation, and rest shelters. 
Negative
(There were no 
negative financial 
implications for the 
FY 23-24)
4.
Business Ethics
R
Adhering to high ethical standards is 
critical to maintaining our business 
reputation and ensuring compliance 
with legal and regulatory requirements. 
Ethical lapses can lead to significant 
financial 
and 
reputational 
damage. 
Since we closely work with government 
authorities on construction mandates, 
ensuring business ethics and integrity is 
paramount to us. 
To mitigate risks related to business ethics, EMS 
is dedicated to upholding the highest standards of 
integrity and transparency in all its operations. We 
have implemented a comprehensive set of policies 
to ensure ethical conduct and compliance with 
legal and regulatory requirements. Our approach 
includes strict enforcement of insider trading 
prevention measures, a robust whistle-blower 
policy that provides a safe and confidential reporting 
channel for unethical behaviour. Additionally, 
we have established a Code of Conduct for senior 
management and the board of directors and a Risk 
Management Policy to proactively address potential 
ethical and operational risks. Our commitment 
is further reinforced by anti-corruption and anti-
bribery policies designed to prevent unethical 
financial practices and ensure compliance with 
relevant laws. Together, these measures create 
a culture of accountability and transparency, 
mitigating 
ethical 
risks 
and 
enhancing 
our 
reputation and operational effectiveness.
