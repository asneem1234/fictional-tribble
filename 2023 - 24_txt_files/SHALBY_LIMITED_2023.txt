medical, 
hazardous, 
and 
general waste. We are dedicated 
to 
ensuring 
that 
our 
waste 
management practices adhere 
to the highest standards of

using water/energy efficient 
equipment. 
To 
address 
water scarcity and promote 
conservation, 
the 
hospital 
introduced 
watersaving 
technologies such as low-
flow faucets and fixtures. We 
have 
energy 
optimization 
practices 
implemented 
in 
transformer operation such as 
introduction of motion sensor

10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy 
adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes 
and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
	
Ans: Hospitals generate biomedical waste, as a by-product of healthcare services that can potentially pose serious health and 
environmental impacts if not handled correctly. At Shalby, we take this topic very seriously by putting in place an effective 
management system of healthcare waste which addresses the basic elements of waste minimization, segregation and identification 
by sorting into categories including medical, general, recycled and food waste. The company has achieved the reduction in 
generation of waste, raw material and other resources through various initiatives like environment awareness campaigns, training 
and monthly monitoring of hazardous & non- hazardous waste. We are not producing carbon but and at the same time, we have 
policy in place to dispose of bio medical waste in accordance with the guideline of the government and to ensure minimum 
generation of radiation within the hospital.
