3) Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of life,

To substitute usage of plastic packaging, the Company has introduced sustainable packaging where bio-degradable 
plastic is used as packaging material. The Company also promotes the usage of gunny bags instead of plastics. 
Consumption of virgin packaging materials like cartons and wooden pallets have been greatly reduced by reusing them 
wherever possible across all the sites.  
 
Through partnerships with authorized agencies, the Company constantly strives to develop mechanisms of recycling 
and reusing hazardous waste generated across its operations. Since majority of the Company’s products are composed 
of steel, therefore the MS scrap is re-used as an input material by feeding the scrap into steel melting furnaces. Other 
waste are disposed through authorised agencies for reusing / recycling.

Yes. EPR is applicable to the Company’s activities, since plastics are used in packaging materials in its products. One 
of the Company’s manufacturing facilities has partnered with registered plastic waste processors to recycle plastic 
waste in conformance to its plan submitted to the Pollution Control Board for fulﬁ llment of its EPR obligation.
