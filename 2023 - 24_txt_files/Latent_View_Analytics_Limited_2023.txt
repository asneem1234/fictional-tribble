Governance, Leadership and Oversight
7. Statement by the director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG-
related challenges, targets and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of 
this disclosure) 
At Latent View, sustainability is at the heart of our business strategy. We understand that our actions today profoundly 
impact the future, and we are committed to driving positive change through our environmental, social, and 
governance (ESG) initiatives. Our approach to sustainability is holistic, encompassing all aspects of our operations 
to ensure we contribute meaningfully to the communities we serve and the planet we share.
We believe sustainable business practices are the fundamental components for long-term success. By integrating 
ESG principles into our core operations, we strive to create value for our stakeholders, foster innovation, and build 
a resilient business model that can adapt to the evolving global landscape.
This year, we have made significant achievements and undertaken impactful initiatives in our sustainability journey. 
One of our key achievements has been improving our Climate Disclosure Project (CDP) score from a “C” to a “B”. 
Our Score “B” falls under the Management band. This is higher than the Asia regional average of C and higher than 
the Specialized professional services sector average of C. This improvement reflects our ongoing efforts to manage 
and reduce our environmental impact. Additionally, we have been awarded a bronze rating in our first year of 
reporting to EcoVadis assessment.
In our quest for energy efficiency, we have replaced all CFL bulbs with energy-efficient LED lighting across our 
operations. This initiative reduces our energy consumption and lowers our carbon footprint. Moreover, we have 
transitioned from high-GWP refrigerants to low-GWP alternatives, minimizing our greenhouse gas emissions. 
We have also developed a sustainable procurement policy and begun implementing sustainable aspects in our 
procurement practices, ensuring that our supply chain aligns with our commitment to sustainability.
As we move forward, We are committed to developing a robust ESG framework and roadmap. This will involve 
setting clear goals and targets for all important areas and initiatives to achieve those goals. We also remain 
dedicated to incorporating ESG principles into every aspect of our operations, striving to improve the quality of life 
in our communities and contribute positively to the environment.

Creating and nurturing a collaborative work environment: We 
make LatentView a safe place to brainstorm and support team 
unity and encourage good manager/employee relationships. 
This supportive culture not only leads to increased productivity 
and innovation but also higher levels of engagement and 
retention. “Knowledge roundtable,” the Service Delivery 
Excellence team in partnership with the Learning and 
development team, joined hands to create a forum where 
teams can showcase their work experience from their projects 
and clients. This has been a great opportunity to explore and 
understand the diverse work that is being done across the 
organization. LatentView has also successfully completed 13 
knowledge roundtable sessions.

Leadership Indicators 
1. Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and social topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to 
the Board?
During our Annual General Meeting, the Board engages with shareholders directly to provide them with an overview of our strategies and to address any queries or concerns that they may have. This communication helps to promote 
transparency and build trust among shareholders.
2. Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, and social topics (Yes/No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from 
stakeholders on these topics were incorporated into policies and activities of the entity:
To help define the most important ESG issues, we have conducted a materiality assessment to remain successful in the long term. All the identified stakeholders were allowed to provide inputs regarding the materiality of certain topics 
which are relevant to the business. It allowed us to capture our non-financial impacts, helped us prioritise issues to focus on, and improved our strategic thinking.
3. Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/marginalized stakeholder groups:
LatentView’s CSR initiatives are strategically aligned to address critical societal challenges and cater to the needs of vulnerable populations, with a particular focus on Students, youth, and marginalized communities. LatentView maintains 
a comprehensive approach throughout its operations, ensuring ethical, economic, social, and environmental sustainability while prioritizing the interests of its key stakeholders. The development of LatentView’s CSR projects is guided by 
ongoing feedback and concerns expressed by stakeholders, including implementation partners and beneficiary communities. This feedback loop is integral to the success of LatentView’s CSR endeavours. LatentView actively gathers and
