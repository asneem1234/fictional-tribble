1.	
Climate 
Change
Risk
The operations and business of 
an organization can be directly 
affected by climate change risk. 
Climate change can be seen leading 
to physical environment risks such 
as water scarcity (direct physical 
risk), 
supply 
chain 
disruption, 
and sourcing challenges (indirect 
physical risk). Additionally, there are 
regulatory, reputational and market 
risks associated with the transition 
to a low-carbon economy. These 
risks encompass changing consumer 
preferences, increased product costs, 
and future government policies and 
regulations.
The following are various Green House 
Gas (GHG) emission reduction initiatives 
undertaken to adapt to and mitigate the 
climate change risk and transition to a low-
carbon products:
1.	 Variable Pressure Foaming (VPF) is 
the only closed loop slab Polyurethane 
foaming process available today. While 
it helps in manufacture of products that 
are differentiated as well as uses less 
chemicals and zero physical blowing 
agent in manufacturing leading to low-
carbon economy. The role of the physical 
blowing agent is done by Vacuum. While 
predominantly the process emission is 
only carbon-dioxide any trace volatile 
organics are also extracted by the 
activated charcoal that is part of the 
closed loop equipment. It is the most 
sustainable 
next 
generation 
foam 
processing technique. The Company is 
invested deeply with second equipment 
expected to be fully operational in 
India. Overseas operations in Spain and 
Australia are also capitalizing on this 
technology. 
2.	 SFL's main consumption consists of 
Polyol, Polymer polyol, and Isocyanate in 
large quantities. We aim at bulk shipment 
and 
storage, 
aiming 
to 
minimize 
transportation impact and minimize 
excessive packaging.
3.	 Introducing 
block 
compression 
for 
interunit transfers and utilizing Bed in 
a Box (BIAB) when feasible will optimize 
space 
utilization, 
enhance 
delivery 
efficiency, and decrease the carbon 
footprint.
4.	 Product 
innovation: 
Introduction 
of 
Neemfresche foams from sustainable 
coconut plantations which has no adverse 
impact on environment.
5.	 Climate change trainings provided as a 
part of the overall ESG training module 
where the coverage extended to both 
employee population and value chain 
partners.
Initiatives and endeavors aimed 
at mitigating climate change risks 
may result in additional costs in the 
short to medium term. However, 
these costs can be partially offset by 
long-term efficiency improvements. 
Moreover, these initiatives enhance 
business resilience and safeguard 
long-term value.

Energy 
Management
Opportunity
Energy 
management 
presents 
a 
strategic opportunity for a company 
like ours to reduce costs, enhance 
competitiveness, 
comply 
with 
regulations, improve reputation, drive 
innovation, and foster collaborations 
in the pursuit of sustainable and 
efficient operations.
1.	 Through Successful implementation of 
energy management programs thereby 
fostering a culture of energy performance 
improvement. We track the energy 
performance through various KPIs such 
as energy consumption, energy intensity, 
evaluation of progress towards energy 
targets etc. The company's objective is to 
decrease reliance on power supplied by 
the Electricity Board by transitioning to 
green energy - solar energy. Several units 
have already been successfully converted 
to solar energy.
2.	 Investments made to achieve energy 
efficiency 
through 
the 
following 
initiatives:
a.	 SFL has installed energy efficient fixtures 
at all manufacturing plants as well as 
corporate office.
b.	 We have replaced diesel gen-sets with 
PNG (Piped Natural Gas) in the NCR 
region, using retrofitted devices. The 
remaining units will undergo assessment 
to determine the feasibility of accessing 
PNG supply from the government.
c.	 Newer 
plants 
like 
Surajpur 
and 
Maneri (Jabalpur) are equipped with 
solar 
streetlights 
saving 
electricity 
consumption. 
3.	 Energy efficiency trainings provided as a 
part of the overall ESG training module 
where the coverage extended to both 
employee population and value chain 
partners.
Implementing 
effective 
energy 
management practices can help 
reduce 
energy 
consumption 
and lower operational costs and 
optimizes equipment performance. 
Further, this also helps us be better 
prepared for future environmental 
regulations.
3.
Human Rights
Risk
Adverse financial and reputational 
consequences 
may 
arise 
from 
instances of human rights violation or 
failure to comply with statutory norms.
1.	 SFL has a dedicated human rights 
policy in line in with the UN Guiding 
Principles, which has been implemented 
on shopfloor and corporate office (both 
permanent and contractual employees 
and workers) and also applies to our 
value chain partners. 
2.	 The company is committed to cultivate 
a culture of zero tolerance towards 
human rights violations. The long existing 
policies and procedures including Non-
Discriminations Policy, Code of Business 
Conduct, Whistle Blower Policy, Policy of 
SFL towards Society and POSH policy have 
been reinforced with the comprehensive 
Human Rights Policy and Diversity Equity 
and Inclusion Policy.  
3.	 Detailed training programs are in place 
to prevent human rights violations. 
Measures are in place to prevent 
workforce discrimination and sexual 
harassment, and to ensure a free and fair 
working environment for employees.
4.	 Human rights assessment for identifying 
potential human rights issues and a due 
diligence process verifying the occurrence 
and impact of these issues is underway.
5.	 Robust grievance redressal mechanisms 
are in place to prevent workforce 
discrimination, 
sexual 
harassment, 
and ensure a free and fair working 
environment for employees
Human 
rights 
violations 
and 
regulatory 
non-compliance 
can 
cause 
reputation 
and 
financial 
implications

4.
Waste 
Management
Opportunity
By embracing waste management as 
an opportunity, we can reduce costs, 
enhance sustainability, comply with 
regulations, drive innovation, and 
contribute to a more circular economy. 
This not only benefits the company's 
bottom line but also strengthens its 
reputation and position in the market.
We have implemented the following waste 
management programs:
1.	 Innovation: The company has adapted 
sustainable packaging material, such 
as 
BOPP-PE 
to 
PE 
(Polyethylene), 
which increases the recyclability of 
the product, making it less hazardous 
to the environment. Additionally, the 
company has successfully implemented 
a comprehensive recycling program for 
polyethylene and plastic materials used 
in product packaging, aiming to achieve 
100% recycling rates.
2.	 The company is committed to a paperless 
mission to conserve paper, trees, and 
water resources. Significant progress 
has already been made by digitizing 
invoices, 
packing 
lists, 
planning 
documents, and gate records. The next 
phase involves establishing a paperless 
shop floor and eventually transitioning 
the entire organization into a paperless 
environment.
3.	 Quantifiable targets: We aim to reduce 
waste generated by 3-5% every year
While there is increased cost of 
developing sustainable packaging 
alternatives but in the long run, the 
recycling and sustainable ways of 
packaging will be beneficial to the 
organization.
5.
Human Capital 
Development
Opportunity
The 
success 
of 
the 
Company's 
operations relies on the ongoing 
dedication, skills, and expertise of its 
corporate and divisional executive 
teams, as well as other highly qualified 
employees who possess extensive 
knowledge in business, technology, 
and operations. The market for skilled 
professionals is highly competitive, 
and there is no guarantee that the 
Company will be able to retain these 
employees or recruit and train suitable 
replacements 
without 
incurring 
significant 
costs 
or 
experiencing 
delays.
1.	 Investing in training and development 
programs
2.	 Offering 
equal 
opportunities 
for 
growth and development demonstrates 
our commitment to our employee's 
professional growth without any biases 
towards employee groups.
3.	 Building a robust talent pipeline across 
responsibility levels through requisite 
quality in key roles.
4.	 Maintaining 
the 
wages 
more 
than 
minimum wage as per applicable code.
5.	 The company tries to maintain an 
employee friendly work environment.
Human Capital Development can 
improve the skills and knowledge 
of employees. This can lead to 
increased productivity, improved 
product quality, and operational 
efficiency within the company.
6.
Occupational 
Health & 
Safety
Risk
Poor occupational health and safety 
(OHS) performance has a direct 
negative impact on labor costs through 
lower productivity. Moreover, it can 
also affect SFL's reputation, impact 
staff morale or increase operating 
costs 
through 
fines 
and 
other 
contingent liabilities. 
1.	 The company has promulgated a clear 
Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) 
Policy communicated through regular 
safety training sessions for its employees. 
2.	 Comprehensive 
training 
on 
safety 
procedures, 
compliance 
regulations, 
and ethical practices fosters a secure 
work environment, reduces accidents, 
and ensures adherence to regulatory 
requirements.                                                        
3.	 All employees at the manufacturing 
plants are equipped with necessary 
safety gear.               
4.	 Stringent safety audits are regularly 
conducted and reinforced through an 
extensive CCTV camera network across all 
units to ensure adherence to the health 
and safety precautions.
5.	 The Company has established an On-site 
Emergency Control Plan, incorporating 
government authorities and neighboring 
industries, which is rehearsed through bi-
annual mock drills.
Non-adherence to the health and 
safety protocols can impact on 
health and well-being of employees 
at the Company and result in 
financial loss.

Product 
Quality & 
Safety
Risk
Product Quality and Safety risk 
can lead to product recalls, legal 
repercussions, and affect Company's 
reputation. It is crucial for us to not 
only maintain our own adherence to 
high standards but also ensure that 
our suppliers and partners uphold 
similar quality and safety practices.
1.	 SFL 
guarantees 
compliance 
with 
Restriction of Hazardous Substances 
(RoHS) and REACH regulations, ensuring 
that all produced foams meet the 
required standards without the utilization 
of restricted or harmful chemicals. 
2.	 The 
company 
has 
incorporated 
NeemFresche technology, sourced from 
sustainable coconut plantations. This 
innovative solution physically eliminates 
pathogens and maintains long-lasting 
effectiveness. Unlike other protectants, 
NeemFresche forms durable bonds with 
cellular structures, ensuring continued 
protection even with prolonged use and 
frequent washes.

line and also used for domestic 
purposes.
1.	 We 
have 
installed 
STP's 
(Sewage 
Treatment Plants) at all manufacturing 
plants and corporate office through which 
domestic wastewater is treated and used 
backed in activities like Gardening and

2.	 We have installed water saving fixtures 
like waterless urinals and flow fixtures at 
our corporate offices and is planned to be 
extended to manufacturing units. 
3.	 Construction of Rainwater harvesting 
pits for recharging ground water table is 
in plan to be extended to manufacturing 
plants. 
Use of recycled water and low flow 
water fixtures results into lesser 
freshwater 
withdrawal 
through 
ground and third-party tankers, 
hence benefiting financially to the 
company.
9.
Corporate 
Governance & 
Ethics
Risk
Adverse Financial and Reputational 
risks may arise due to unethical

to cater to all the regulatory requirements 
from local and national government. 
2.	 We have a dedicated business code of 
conduct policy which is applicable to all 
employees for ethical business conduct.

business 
practices 
and 
compliance 
to 
regulatory 
requirements will prevent non-
compliances and potential regulatory 
fines from the government.
10.

technology, 
Vetiver 
inputs 
from 
production, development of specialized 
foam for medical usage etc.
Innovation and R&D will lead to 
financial benefits to the company 
by 
optimizing 
the 
existing 
manufacturing process and exploring 
new products lines in foam market to 
increase the overall revenue of the 
company.

Emotional Wellness Programme:
	
Sleepwell foundation is championing the advocacy of 
substituting the term mental with emotional and bringing 
proactiveness in emotional wellness.
	
Our Initiative supports the IEC activities of the Government of 
India's National Mental Health Program (NMHP) for the purpose 
of increasing awareness of mental health. Through our initiatives 
we create literacy and build awareness of proactive emotional 
wellness. 11,255 beneficiaries have been impacted by emotional 
wellness workshops. Additionally, the Awareness Videos and 
Reels on social media has impacted 1,20,45,533 beneficiaries. 
	
Our initiatives include educational workshops for children 
and youth, teacher training, and community-level counsellor 
programs. We cover topics like Gender Sensitization, Stress 
Management, Menstrual Health, Bullying Prevention, and 
Communication. These efforts aim to create an emotionally safe 
environment for growth. Through social media, our emotional 
wellness films reach millions, influencing societal behavior. 
Our BBCS (Barefoot Basic Counselling Skills) Workshops train 
grassroots mental health counsellors, addressing the shortage 
of counsellors in India.
	
Skill Development Programme: 
	
Set up Sleepwell Foundation Skill Development Centre at Village 
Mirpur on the outskirts of Khurja, (UP). The Centre is training 
people and is helping to meet the objectives of the National 
Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) in filling the skill gap 
and achieving the vision of a 'Skilled India'. 2,630 beneficiaries 
have been impacted by the activities carried out by the Skill 
Development Programme. 
	
Sleepwell Foundation is a firm believer in the power of 
Proactiveness and creating opportunities before even when 
the need arises. Preventive or proactive approach helps in 
alleviating many challenges much before they become acute 
issues and is many times able to nip the problem in the bud.
	
Recognizing the need to prepare rural youth, Sleepwell 
Foundation established Col Gautam Academy to train recruits 
for the Indian army and paramilitary forces. The academy trains 
both girls and boys, offering physical and classroom instruction, 
along with essential guidance on recruitment procedures for the 
Army, Navy, Air Force, Police, and other services. Understanding 
the social constraints on young women in rural areas, Sleepwell 
Foundation offers practical and sustainable skills courses that 
empower youth within their communities, enabling them to 
secure employment and contribute to the local economy.
	
Paramedical Courses:  
	
The Covid-19 pandemic exposed the shortage of healthcare 
professionals in rural India and highlighted rural-urban health 
disparities. To address this, we introduced Paramedical Courses 
at SDC Khurja, in partnership with DPMI, a leader in healthcare 
training in India. These courses, which saw high participation 
from both men and women, led to internships at local hospitals 
and healthcare facilities in and around Khurja. Aligned with SDG 
3, our aim is to ensure universal health coverage and equitable 
access to healthcare in rural areas.
	
Selling Skill Course:
	
Sales is the backbone of any business, employing millions. 
Recognizing the potential, especially with the upcoming 
Noida International Airport at Jewar, we introduced a Selling 
Skill Course at SDC Khurja. This course teaches basic selling 
skills and modern marketing principles, equipping trainees to 
become effective salespeople. Taught by industry experts, it 
aims to create numerous job opportunities and provide decent 
work for graduates.
	
MasterG's fashion design course for women is a step in 
this direction. Traditionally, patternmaking in garment 
manufacturing has been a male-dominated role, passed down
