BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT
ABOUT BRSR
The Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report is an initiative by the Securities and Exchange Board of India designed 
to foster responsible and sustainable business conduct among India’s listed entities. Launched in 2021, the BRSR enhances 
and broadens the scope of the predecessor Business Responsibility Reporting by emphasizing the importance of transparent 
ESG disclosures.
Top 1,000 listed entities in India, as per market capitalization, are mandated to furnish detailed reports on ESG aspects under 
the BRSR guidelines. This encompasses a spectrum of areas, such as the company’s environmental footprint, social welfare 
efforts, governance, interactions with stakeholders, and adherence to ethical standards. The aim is to offer stakeholders a 
comprehensive overview of the company’s commitments to societal and environmental responsibility.
Companies are instructed to integrate ESG disclosures into their mainstream annual reports or to present them separately as 
sustainability reports. The BRSR seeks to incentivize the adoption of ESG principles within core business strategies, fostering 
alignment with global sustainability standards and principles. The report is divided into three sections:
 
z
Section A: General Disclosures
 
z
Section B: Management and Process Disclosures
 
z
Section C: Principle Wise Performance Disclosures
LEADERSHIP HIGHLIGHT
Our Managing Director, Mr. Shripad Ashtekar won the Most Promising Business Leaders of Asia at Times Now Asian Business 
Leaders Conclave 2024. He is a true visionary transforming the DOOH media landscape and setting new benchmarks with his

that present a risk or an opportunity to your business, rationale for identifying the same, approach to adapt or mitigate 
the risk along-with its financial implications

Financial

of the risk or

(Indicate

Extremely 
large sized 
billboards
O
A majority of our media assets are 
transit media such as buses, metro 
stations and bus queue shelters. 
Large billboards always have a risk 
of falling, which is not the case for 
our company as we have very few 
billboards that too of medium or 
small sizes.
NA

Prints
O
The use of eco-friendly inks for 
our prints is a practice towards 
sustainability. Each print ensures that 
every visual display leaves a positive 
mark on both viewers and the Earth.
NA

Electronic 
waste
R
A majority and crucial part of our 
media assets is Digital media which 
generates a significant amount of 
E-waste. Improper disposal can 
lead to environmental harm due to 
hazardous materials in e-waste, legal 
repercussions from non-compliance 
with regulations, and damage to our 
brand’s reputation if we’re seen as 
irresponsible. Additionally, there are 
data security concerns if sensitive 
information is not properly wiped, and 
managing e-waste incurs costs and 
operational disruptions. Addressing 
these risks requires a strategic 
approach to ensure compliance, 
protect our reputation, and mitigate 
environmental and security impacts.
The Company is committed to making 
the recycling or disposal of old and 
obsolete electronic components as 
convenient as possible, as part of 
our ongoing efforts.

Data 
Privacy
R
As a company leveraging data 
analytics and digital capabilities to 
understand consumer behaviour 
and market trends, data privacy is 
a critical concern. The collection, 
storage, and analysis of vast amounts 
of consumer data can expose the 
company to significant risks if 
personal information is mishandled 
or breached. Non-compliance with 
data protection regulations can 
lead to legal penalties, reputational 
damage, and loss of consumer trust.
To mitigate the risks associated with 
data privacy in our company, we 
have implemented comprehensive 
measures to safeguard consumer 
information. Our robust privacy 
policy ensures that all data collection, 
storage, and analysis practices adhere 
strictly to data protection regulations. 
We are committed to maintaining 
full compliance with all relevant 
laws and have established rigorous 
protocols to prevent data breaches. 
By continuously monitoring and 
updating our security systems, we 
strive to protect personal information, 
thereby preserving consumer trust 
and avoiding legal and reputational 
repercussions.

Advertising

R
Maintaining advertising integrity is 
crucial in building and sustaining trust 
with consumers and stakeholders. 
Misleading or unethical advertising 
practices can lead to customer 
dissatisfaction, regulatory fines, 
and long-term damage to the 
company's brand reputation. As 
consumer awareness and regulatory 
requirements regarding advertising 
transparency increase, ensuring 
ethical practices becomes increasingly 
important.
To mitigate risks and maintain 
advertising integrity, we strive for 
strict adherence to ethical standards 
and transparency in all our marketing 
practices. We continuously review 
and update our advertising strategies 
to ensure compliance with evolving 
regulations and to uphold consumer 
trust. By prioritizing honesty and 
clarity in our communications, we aim 
to prevent customer dissatisfaction 
and protect our brand reputation.

Diversity & 
Inclusion
O
Embracing and promoting workforce 
diversity presents a significant 
opportunity for the company. A diverse 
workforce can enhance creativity, 
improve problem-solving, and better 
reflect the varied perspectives of 
the consumer base, leading to more 
innovative solutions and a stronger 
market position. By fostering an 
inclusive work environment, the 
company can attract top talent, 
enhance employee satisfaction, and 
better understand and meet the needs 
of a diverse customer base.
