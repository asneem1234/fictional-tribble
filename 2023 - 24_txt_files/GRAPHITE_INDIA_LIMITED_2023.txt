residue) and our main energy 
usage is from CBM which is 
from capture of methane from 
coal mines that would have been 
a waste if not used. We have 
carried our LCA for our main 
product (Graphite Electrodes) 
and trying to reduce the negative 
environmental impact through 
resource efﬁciency.

We have several 
identiﬁ ed projects for GHG emission reduction. Some of these are implemented, some under implementation and 
some to be initiated. We focus on energy efﬁ ciency as a continual endeavour and take support of reputed agencies 
like Veolia to help us identify energy saving opportunities. Several energy saving projects have been implemented 
and some are being implemented. We have started getting beneﬁ ts of these initiatives and the results mentioned 
above justify our efforts. We have also ﬁ nalized renewable energy (wind – solar hybrid) arrangements for our Satpur 
plant and from the year 2024-25 a signiﬁ cant portion of the grid electricity will be replaced with renewable energy. 
We are exploring this possibility for our other plants also. We, anyway, use CBM and PNG as our principal fuel and 
as such our GHG intensity is reasonable low. We have carried out LCA for our main product Graphite Electrode and 
the results are very encouraging. Our scope 3 emissions are also quite reasonable. Further, since our main product 
Graphite Electrode supports use of scrap in EAF to produce steel, our scope 4 emissions (avoided emissions) is also 
signiﬁ cant because our product replaces steel production using virgin natural resources in blast furnace route.

During the year we have made our waste data robust. We have started using SAP gate module in the weighbridges so that 
data on material entry and waste exit from our factories are directly entered into our ERP system from the weighbridges 
thus reducing possibility of error.
