Energy 
Management 
(Climate 
Change, GHG 
Emissions and 
Air Pollution)
Risk
The 
evolving 
landscape 
of 
regulations 
that 
affect 
emissions and climate change 
presents a significant risk due 
to the potentially dangerous 
nature of the operations we 
conduct.
To address the risk, the Company has 
taken several proactive steps, including:
i.	
Setting 
up 
renewable 
energy 
installations, like solar and wind, 
both within and around the plant 
to decrease reliance on externally 
sourced electricity.
ii.	
Green Power Purchase agreement
iii.	
Conducting 
tree 
plantation 
initiatives in and around the plant 
area.
iv.	
Installing solar heaters within the 
plant to harness direct thermal 
energy for various processes.
Negative- No negative 
impact in the reporting year.
1  Material issues identified are referred from the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) 2023-24 version. SASB Standards are maintained and enhanced by 
the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB); this follows the SASB’s merger with the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) into the Value Reporting 
Foundation (VRF) and subsequent consolidation into the IFRS® Foundation in 2022

For GHFL, the disposal of

factor, given that plastic is the 
most critical component of our 
products. 
The Company collaborates with external 
entities to retrieve post-consumer waste 
under Extended Producer Responsibility.
Negative- No negative 
impact in the reporting year.

5. 
Occupational 
Health and 
Safety
Risk
Incidents 
related 
to 
Occupational 
Health 
and 
Safety 
have 
the 
potential 
to 
tarnish 
a 
Company’s 
image 
among 
employees, 
clients, 
investors 
and 
the 
wider 
community. 
Reports 
of 
workplace 
mishaps 
or 
occupational 
diseases 
can 
lower 
the 
morale 
of 
the 
workforce 
and 
adversely 
influence the perception of the 
organization’s commitment to 
safety and wellbeing.
The Company has enacted various 
strategies to manage risk, including:
• 
A comprehensive safety policy 
rooted in the cycle of Planning, 
Doing, Checking and Acting.
• 
Regular assessments of the plant 
and its facilities to identify and 
correct any unsafe or substandard 
conditions that may lead to injury 
or harm.
• 
Implementation 
of 
procedures 
such 
as 
Hazard 
Identification 
and Risk Assessment, as well as 
systems for reporting hazards, 
incidents and near misses, to 
recognize workplace hazards and 
assess risks.
Negative- No negative 
impact in the reporting year.
6.
Supply chain
Risk
Inability to acquire equipment, 
reagents, or chemicals in a 
timely manner, or altogether, 
from third parties on agreeable 
commercial terms could hinder 
our capacity to deliver our 
orders. Moreover, some of 
our medical and laboratory 
apparatus 
are 
obtained 
through leasing arrangements.
The Company adheres to its established 
Standard Operating Procedures for 
sustainable purchasing and conducts 
daily oversight of Released Purchase 
Requisitions (Sanctions), open Purchase 
Orders (Materials in transit), as well 
as inventories of Major Raw Materials, 
Consumables, Critical Spare Parts and 
Project-related items.
Negative- No negative 
impact in the reporting year.
7.
Labour 
Relations
Risk
GHFL could encounter risks 
to its reputation and increased 
lawsuits if it fails to comply 
with 
legal 
and 
regulatory 
requirements concerning its 
labour force it utilizes.
The Company has established an audit 
committee tasked with overseeing the 
Company’s adherence to regulatory 
compliance, ensuring that the Company 
refrains from employing child labour 
or forced labour. Additionally, GHFL 
ensures that all its labour compliances 
are timely complied with.
Negative- No negative

GARWARE HI-TECH FILMS LIMITED
ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24
Garware Hi-Tech Films Ltd's remarkable transition to a carbon negative company in its high-tech polyester film production 
facilities in Waluj and Chikalthana, Aurangabad aligns impeccably with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 
for Climate Action. This significant environmental milestone underscores the company's dedication to combating climate 
change through decisive action, actively reducing greenhouse gas emissions beyond neutrality.
The initiative undertaken by our company to employ Rain Water Harvesting and utilize treated water from Reverse Osmosis 
Plants embodies a direct contribution to the Sustainable Development Goal for clean water and sanitation. By recharging 
groundwater levels and executing land remediation, we significantly diminish our reliance on conventional water sources 
for gardening and plantation activities. The pioneering approach offunnelling 100% of the RO-treated water back into our 
systems further showcases our commitment to a circular water economy. With our innovative runoff plant, we’re able to 
reintroduce as much as150 million litres of water to the ground annually. These efforts lead not only to the replenishment 
of the groundwater table but also promote overall water sustainability, reflecting our dedication to ecological conservation 
and resource management for future generations.
Garware’s initiative to organize a free health check-up camp is in direct resonance with the Sustainable Development Goal 
for good health and well-being. By providing essential medical assistance to those in need, Garware is actively contributing 
to ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all, which is at the core of this particular SDG.
Our initiative to sustainably reduce energy consumption by upgrading to LED lamps and highly efficient motors, alongside 
the use of biomass briquettes in place of fossil fuels for steam boilers, exemplifies our commitment to the Sustainable 
Development Goal for affordable and clean energy. By transitioning away from mineral fuels and replacing furnace oil 
with LPG, we not only minimize energy costs but also cut down on toxic emissions. This approach is pivotal for fostering 
cleaner energy usage and reducing our carbon footprint, thereby contributing to the creation of a sustainable energy future.
Garware Hi-Tech Films Ltd’s adoption of cutting-edge screw press technology in our Effluent Treatment Plant directly 
supports the Sustainable Development Goal for industry, innovation, and infrastructure. This innovative approach 
eliminates the need for sludge drying beds, thereby preventing groundwater contamination and minimizing air pollution 
from vapor emissions. Furthermore, our implementation of processes like blowdowns to efficiently convert liquid waste into 
solids demonstrates our ongoing pursuit of industrial innovation that champions safety and sustainability.
The commitment to achieving zero liquid discharge through innovations and advanced treatments aligns with the 
Sustainable Development Goal for life below water. By utilizing effluent treatment plants and state-of-the-art Reverse 
Osmosis facilities, we ensure that processed water is recycled effectively. The use of Sewage Treatment Plants to treat 
and repurpose 100% of domestic effluent for gardening further reduces the potential harm to aquatic ecosystems. These 
measures are integral to preserving the integrity of marine life by preventing water pollution and promoting the sustainable 
use of our planet’s water resources.

GARWARE HI-TECH FILMS LIMITED
ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24
Our dedication as a responsible manufacturer to enrich the planet reflects our alignment with the Sustainable Development 
Goal for life on land. Through our tree-planting initiatives at and around our manufacturing sites, and maintaining over 
35% of open land as green spaces, we actively contribute to the resurgence and health of terrestrial ecosystems. Our 
in-house green nursery, which offers a plentiful supply of plants, further emphasizes our commitment to reforestation and 
biodiversity.
By introducing certified post-consumer recycled PET products and actively engaging in the recycling and reuse of plastic 
waste in line with Extended Producer Responsibility, we are exemplifying our commitment to the Sustainable Development 
Goal for responsible consumption and production. These initiatives are vital in reducing our environmental footprint by 
minimizing waste and promoting a closed-loop economy. They underscore the importance of sustainable manufacturing 
processes and the efficient use of resources.
