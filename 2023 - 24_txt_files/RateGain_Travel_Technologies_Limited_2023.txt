significant 
reputation damage.
The

Governance, leadership and oversight
7.	Statement 
by 
director 
responsible 
for 
the 
business 
responsibility 
report, highlighting ESG 
related challenges, targets 
and achievements
RateGain had expanded its sustainability agenda with a broader baseline 
of E, S and G parameters, establishing a strong foundation and aligning 
it with the regulatory BRSR framework during FY 2022-23. This period 
also involved gauging customer sentiments within the Travel and Tourism 
industry. Moving into FY 2023-24, RateGain expanded its focus to engage 
with its key stakeholders across its ecosystem to strengthen the Company’s 
ESG positioning. While recognizing that the direct footprint as a Technology 
Company might be limited, a broader perspective of ecosystem impact is 
deemed essential to lay the groundwork for a meaningful journey.
For RateGain, FY 2023-24 saw deeper engagement with both internal 
stakeholders and external stakeholders. We took up employee-centric 
initiatives with our focused Employee Resource Groups (ERGs), 2nd 
Innings program, Passion Clubs and more. We also introduced an 
employee-friendly HR Management system (HRMS) released the Employee 
Handbook. Alongside this, our focus on community well-being also scaled 
up significantly. We took up projects considering their impact on both the 
social and environmental parameters. As an example, the Green Yatra project 
provided RateGain an opportunity to enhance Green Cover through Miyawaki 
afforestation within the urban periphery.
Within our operations, we progressed on our transformation into an efficient 
enterprise by optimizing our IT infrastructure, processes and products. 
Our commitment to employee welfare, across the RateGain enterprise, 
continues to remain strong. We enhanced this with the introduction of an 
employee-friendly digital channel for all employee touchpoints with the 
HR department. 
Looking forward, RateGain will use the experiences and insights from this 
year’s initiatives and accomplishments to scale further on its ESG agenda, 
maintaining a balance between the E, S and G pillars. The Sustainability 
Committee constituted recently will oversee the implementation of plans 
that drive RateGain towards its declared ESG purpose. 
RateGain looks forward to the coming years with confidence based on its 
foundational efforts to embrace sustainability.

RateGain remains perpetually committed to maintain a healthy, fair, and inclusive

and effectively. 
In accordance with this, the Company has recently replaced its HR Management

By offering multiple avenues for grievance redressal, RateGain reinforces its 
commitment to ensuring a fair and transparent workplace for all employees.
RateGain’s Whistleblower Policy outlines the procedure and channels for 
addressing grievances, ensuring transparency and accountability.
In case employees face any form of harassment including sexual harassment, they 
can raise a complaint on icc.@rategain.com and the same would be promptly 
forwarded to the POSH committee for review and investigation. Based on the 
outcome of the investigation, the action is taken as per the recommendations 
of the committee. The employee who has raised the complaint, is protected 
from backlash by either providing paid leave to the employee or by moving the 
employee another team in case a team member or supervisor of the employee 
who is accused of the harassment.

Please provide details of air emissions (other than GHG emissions) by the entity, in the following format: 
	
RateGain is a service sector Company, and it operates from leased premises. The building is LEED Certified 
building.  We occupy 1 out of total 6 floors whereas different companies operate from other floors.  For 
electricity needs, we obtain electricity from the builder/lessor. They in turn obtain the same from the State 
Electricity Board. Only in case of electricity power cut, DGs are used by builder/lessor to supply power to 
the offices. Builder/lessor bills the lessees as per number of units consumed. Builder/lessor get the stack 
emission & ambient air emission testing done through independent agencies twice a year. Considering that 
RateGain’s occupancy is limited to one of the floors in this multi-tenant leased building, the Company is 
not able to arrive at the air emissions attributable to its operations. However, all air quality parameters were 
within the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) parameters. RateGain actively obtains such test reports 
from the Builder/Lessor to keep a tab on emissions done by them.

Note: During FY2023-24, RateGain worked closely with its waste recyclers to understand what happens with the e-waste 
after they collect it. Based on this, we have been able to collect data for waster recovered and waste disposed during the 
year. The solid waste (wet and dry waste) also reaches the landfills through the Municipal authorities.
	
Note: Indicate if any independent assessment/ evaluation/assurance has been carried out by an 
external agency? (Y/N) If yes, name of the external agency.

10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the 
strategy adopted by your Company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products 
and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes. 
	
RateGain is an IT Services Company with no manufacturing business. Therefore, the Company does not 
generate any type of hazardous waste from its operations. RateGain generates solid waste (municipal 
waste), e-waste (assets used by companies for operating) and battery waste (laptop batteries), as a result of 
its operations.
	
The Company takes waste management seriously and implements appropriate measures to manage waste 
effectively. Waste generated in the Company is collected and segregated using proper dustbins. Wet and 
dry waste is handed over to the city municipal corporation for management. E-waste is sent to certified 
third-party recyclers for safe disposal and recycling. Furthermore, old and worn-out batteries are exchanged 
during the purchase of new batteries, ensuring responsible disposal and environmental protection. 
These initiatives reflect the Company’s commitment to sustainable waste management practices.

The Company has also revisited the numbers for emissions at the Data Center. This is in alignment with the GHG Protocol 
definition of scope 3 emissions, i.e  Scope 3 emissions for purchased goods and services are Scope 1 and 2 emissions of 
the supplier. So, we have removed the indirect emissions of the data center operations and only considered their Scope 1 
and Scope 2 emissions. This has been reflected in the numbers for both FY2023-24 and FY 2022-23.

RateGain’s Business Continuity Plan aims to facilitate the restoration of critical Company services in the 
event of facility disruptions caused by natural or artificial disasters. Distinct from the IT Disaster Recovery 
Plan, which focuses on technology facilities’ restoration, this plan concentrates on localized disasters. 
It relies on the existence of a viable IT Disaster Recovery Plan, available relocation space, and ongoing 
plan maintenance. Moreover, its sections delineate the business continuity strategy for facility disruptions, 
identify Recovery Team functions with specific responsibilities, and outline the sequence of activities and 
sub-team responsibilities for recovery.

Disclose any significant adverse impact to the environment, arising from the value chain of the entity. 
What mitigation or adaptation measures have been taken by the entity in this regard.
	
With RateGain being a IT services Company, its value chain’s environmental impact is relatively low. 
However, the Company has been conscious about progressing towards making the right choices. In its 
leased office premises, RateGain has worked closely with the building owner to highlight our requirements 
to lessen the environmental burden – water management, energy management, air pollution etc.
