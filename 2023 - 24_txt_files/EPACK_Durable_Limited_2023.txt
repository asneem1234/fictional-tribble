Product 
Stewardship
Opportunity
EPACK Durable can leverage 
product stewardship as a 
strategic opportunity to 
demonstrate its commitment 
to sustainability and customer 
satisfaction. By designing 
and manufacturing durable 
products with recyclability and 
reusability, EPACK Durable can 
promote circular economy. 
This approach can foster 
customer loyalty, enhance

opportunity for EPACK 
Durable to demonstrate its 
commitment to transparency, 
accountability, and ethical 
business practices. Good 
governance practices will 
enable EPACK Durable to 
foster trust with stakeholders 
and enhance reputation.
-
Positive
Supply Chain 
Management
Risk
EPACK Durable’s reliance on 
its supply chain to deliver 
high-quality products makes 
effective management crucial. 
Disruptions or failures can 
significantly impact operations, 
reputation, and decreased 
market share.
The Company actively 
engages with its supply 
chain partners at regular 
intervals to train them on 
various Company policies 
and ensures compliance 
from them. Expectations 
from the suppliers are also 
communicated periodically 
through the procurement 
teams and in vendor meets.
Negative
Waste 
Management
Risk
Improper management 
of generated waste could 
contaminate soil and 
water causing harm to 
the ecosystem. This could 
eventually lead to legal 
ramifications and could 
potentially damage the 
Company’s reputation.
The Company has measures 
to track, monitor, and record 
the quantity of waste which 
is generated and disposed. 
Additionally, EPACK Durable 
actively works to increase the 
recyclability of input materials 
used.
Negative
Water 
Management
Risk
Inadequate water 
management could result in 
increased operational cost 
and could incur fines for 
non-compliance with water 
standards. Furthermore, 
improper effluent 
management poses a risk of 
contamination and could result 
in regulatory liabilities.
EPACK Durable has 
implemented measures to 
efficiently treat wastewater 
before discharge.

Climate 
Change 
Strategy
Risk
Extreme climate events such 
as flooding, drought, and heat 
waves are likely to impact 
productivity and operations of 
our employees, workers, and 
value chain partners, posing a 
business continuity risk.
We have robust business 
continuity practices which 
allow us to anticipate climate 
related risks and ensure timely 
mitigation.

& Energy 
Management
Opportunity
Upon recognizing how 
greenhouse gases contribute 
to escalating climate change 
risks, EPACK Durable has 
earnestly taken measures to 
track, monitor, and report 
on its energy consumption. 
Currently, 67% of our plants 
have access to renewable 
energy. EPACK Durable is 
committed to developing 
sustainable air conditioners 
(ACs) with refrigerants that 
have lower global warming 
potential. This initiative is
