Environmental 
Impact 
(Climate, 
Energy, Waste)
Risk
Globally, climate change risks 
are leading to regulations 
tightening, posing compliance 
headwinds. Additionally, 
customers, investors, and other 
stakeholders are also concerned 
with GHG emissions and climate 
impacts. 
Poor waste management 
practices lead to compliance/
regulatory risks as well as 
pollution, health risks, etc. to 
the Company’s communities.
The Company has constituted an Energy 
Conservation team across all locations to drive 
improvements in energy conservation and 
GHG reduction. These include improving the 
Company’s renewable mix, cleaner fuels, and 
investments in energy-efficient equipment. 
For more details, please refer to Principle 6, 
Essential Indicators 1 and 7 for quantification 
and 8 for projects. 
Additional commentary is available in the 
section on “Championing environmental 
stewardship” in the Annual Report on Pages 
44-45.
Negative
Opportunity
Resource efficiency 
improvements for energy and 
waste reduce costs, boosting 
competitiveness while GHG 
emission reductions lower 
the Company’s environmental 
impacts, boosts the Company’s 
competitiveness and brand 
among significant stakeholders.
The Company’s manufacturing operations 
in line with circularity principles emphasize 
the use of secondary/recycled Aluminium 
for the bulk of the raw material consumption 
which inherently uses significantly less energy 
compared to primary Aluminium. Additionally, 
the Company recovers and recycles most of 
the scrap Aluminium generated during its 
operations. The Company has aligned its 
waste management practices with a focus on 
circularity and various initiatives have been 
put in place to incorporate the principles 
of Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle throughout 
its operations, aiming to enhance resource 
efficiency. Further, the Company ensures 
compliance with the Pollution Control Board 
and Environment Protection rules, including 
Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR).
For more details, please refer to Principle 6, 
Essential Indicator 10.
Positive
2
Environmental 
Impact (Air, 
Water)
 Risk
Manufacturing operations 
could cause excessive air and 
water pollution which if not 
managed, pose regulatory, 
health, and ecological risks. 
Not mitigating these impacts 
could result in non-compliance-
related stoppages and fines, the 
Company’s ‘license to operate’ 
from communities besides its 
reputation.
The Company’s manufacturing units are 
compliant with the applicable environmental 
laws, regulations, and guidelines for 
air pollutants and water management. 
Wastewater treatment (STP, ETP) is installed 
at all of the Company plants to meet the 
regulatory requirements of each plant location. 
A variety of water conservation initiatives are 
in place at the Company’s plants and it also 
supports initiatives to address water resilience 
in its communities through the CSR programs.

Customer 
Focus & 
Innovation
Risk
A responsive and collaborative 
relationship helps address 
rapidly shifting customer 
needs and market trends. 
Lack of innovation impacts 
competitiveness and business 
sustainability.
Customer Centricity is a core pillar of the 
Endurance value system which is supported 
by a strong organisational culture and 
sensitization of the workforce. The Company 
partners and collaborates closely with 
the customers, focusing on customer 
responsiveness, quality, and service levels as 
per the QCDDM framework. The Company 
also engages actively with its customers 
to meet their ESG ambitions including 
taking leadership roles in their supplier ESG 
engagement committees.
Positive
Opportunity
Besides agility in responding 
to dynamic customer needs, 
innovation promotes product 
differentiation, enhanced 
product offerings, and unique 
solutions leading to revenue 
diversification and market 
expansion.
The Company monitors evolving customer 
needs that help define its R&D and innovation 
strategy currently focused on new product 
development and new technologies that have 
environmental and social impacts including 
lightweighting, improving energy recovery, 
and better vehicle safety among others. The 
Company has a well-established track record 
of innovative IP-based proprietary products 
that have a positive impact on customer 
satisfaction, revenue, and profit growth. This 
is supported by a focus on appropriate IP 
protection through patents, trademarks, etc. 
For more details, please refer to Annual Report 
section on “Accelerating our R&D efforts”, 
Pages 28-32 and the Technology Absorption 
section of Annexure I to the Board’s Report on 
Pages 82-84.
Note: The scope of the BRSR is on a 
standalone basis, however, the Company’s 
investment in its subsidiary, Maxwell 
underscores the Company’s commitment to 
support the EV transition. The Company plans 
to continue to invest in R&D to drive the EV 
ecosystem. 
4
Sustainable 
Supply Chain
Opportunity
Implementing sustainable 
practices throughout the value 
chain enhances environmental 
stewardship and reduces the 
Company’s footprint. This aligns 
with customer and investor 
needs and the Company’s ESG 
strategy. Proactive engagement 
with suppliers on ESG practices 
fosters long-term partnerships 
and resilience in the supply 
chain. This collaborative 
approach reduces operational 
risks, builds a cost advantage, 
and enhances overall business 
model resilience.
The Company has a very active engagement 
with its suppliers on a variety of transactional 
and strategic matters. The Company has an 
active Endurance Vendor Association (EVA) 
with whom it engages regularly as a forum 
for sharing strategies and best practices for 
vendors while ensuring alignment with the 
Company’s ESG value chain aspirations. This 
allows the Company to obtain feedback 
and define action areas to address the 
needs and challenges of its suppliers. The 
Company has a Supplier Code of Conduct 
which includes the principles and aspects of 
Sustainable Sourcing that it expects from and 
monitors for its value chain partners. Relevant 
awareness and capacity-building programmes 
on core sustainability issues are conducted 
for the Company’s value chain partners 
supplemented by ESG audits. The Company 
also continuously optimizes its supplier base 
and supply chain based on risk assessment 
and other optimization techniques.

1, Leadership Indicator 1 & Principle 2, 
Leadership Indicator 2.

Health & 
Safety
Risk
Occupational health and safety 
incidents can impact satisfaction 
with working conditions and 
decrease employee morale. 
At a minimum, there is a need 
to meet compliance-related 
requirements. Incidents also 
result in an impact on operating 
costs including medical 
expenses, compensation 
claims, and insurance premiums 
besides opportunity costs 
related to productivity and 
lost time. Health and Safety 
performance is an important 
consideration for significant 
stakeholders, including 
employees, customers, and 
investors.
The Company places paramount importance 
on fostering a secure and healthy work 
environment for all staff members, including 
employees, workers, and contracted 
personnel. 
Senior management drives the organizational 
culture across all levels to emphasize zero 
tolerance for unsafe acts and conditions. 
There is a monthly review across functions 
and plants which is led by the Managing 
Director. A robust occupational health and 
safety management system is in place that 
identifies leading indicators like Incident Rate, 
Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (“LTIFR”), 
Severity Rate and Near-miss reporting. The 
Company has established practices aligned 
with international regulations and is focused 
on a Safety First and Zero Harm Culture.  
For more details, please refer to Principle 3, 
Essential Indicators 10 and 12. 
Negative

Labour 
Management
Risk
The Company leverages a 
significant labour workforce 
for various operational tasks 
as part of the Company’s 
operating model. Maintaining 
stable and harmonious labour 
relations is essential for 
business continuity and healthy 
stakeholder relationships. Risks 
associated with inadequate 
labour management include 
disruptions in workflow, 
decreased productivity, 
compliance risks, and potential 
regulatory/legal issues 
stemming from labour disputes.
The workforce at the Company includes 
both permanent and contractual workers. 
There is a dedicated industrial relations 
team with representation at each plant 
aligned to Endurance’s Human Capital 
Management strategy. The Company has 
robust policies and a governance framework

Positive
Opportunity
Enhancing the work 
environment, competitive 
compensation, and growth 
opportunities improves 
employee engagement, 
retention, and the overall 
employee experience. Fostering 
a progressive company culture 
boosts productivity, maintains 
quality, and institutional 
knowledge, and enhances 
competitiveness. These aspects 
have an overall positive impact 
on the Company as  
an “Employer Brand”.

Diversity
Opportunity
Embracing diversity fosters 
innovation and creativity 
through varied perspectives 
and backgrounds. A diverse 
workforce better understands 
customer needs, improving 
products and services. Inclusive 
workplaces attract top talent, 
boosting employer reputation 
and employee satisfaction. 
Diverse leadership enhances 
decision-making and problem-
solving, driving business 
success. Diverse teams are more 
productive, yielding efficient 
outcomes with their array of 
ideas and approaches.
The Company has a well-defined non-
discrimination policy which is also embodied

gender diversity aspects. The Endurance 
Diversity Equity and Inclusion Committee 
(EDEIC) drives efforts to foster a culture of 
belongingness and diversity, promoting all 
aspects of DEI. Initiatives include a web-
based training module covering foundational 
Diversity & Inclusion topics and workshops 
for senior leaders and senior managers on 
addressing unconscious bias and driving D&I 
improvements within their teams. Additionally,

Human Rights
Risk
Violations of human rights in 
company operations or supply 
chains can lead to legal issues, 
fines, and employee discontent, 
affecting productivity and 
stability. Failing to maintain 
human rights standards can 
damage reputation, disrupt 
the Company’s operations, 
and erode consumer trust, 
impacting sales. Supply chain 
disruptions from human rights 
issues like labour disputes or 
child labour allegations can 
increase costs and delays in 
production.
Human Rights is a key area of focus in the 
Company’s corporate governance, supply 
chain/sourcing as well as operating teams. 
The Company emphasizes addressing aspects 
including but not limited to wages, freedom 
of association, ensuring compliance to 
regulatory and legal norms, POSH, ensuring 
non-discrimination, child/forced labour, etc. 
The Company has implemented software 
for ensuring adherence to the requisite 
compliances, supported by monitoring and 
audit protocols. The Company’s contractual 
obligations include human rights expectations 
from the contractors, vendors, and suppliers. 
For more details, please refer to Principle 5 of 
this BRSR.

Risk 
Management
Risk
Enterprise risk management 
is an essential component of 
corporate governance to ensure 
resilience when faced with 
financial, and extra-financial 
risks including externalities 
like climate change and 
natural disasters. Significant 
stakeholders are paying 
increasing importance to 
ESG risks as a measure of the 
ability of companies to address 
multiple stakeholders’ interests.  
Failure to properly identify 
and mitigate risks can lead 
to operational disruptions, 
business continuity, 
environmental and reputational 
risks leading to legal issues, 
regulatory violations, and 
market share loss.
The Company’s corporate governance 
framework covers all its responsibilities as 
a listed entity as per applicable rules and 
regulations at a minimum. In addition, 
the Company has a strong stakeholder 
engagement and management mechanism 
to address risks and opportunities based on 
their evolving needs and expectations. This 
is aligned with the Company’s vision. The 
Company has a detailed risk management 
policy that covers a wide variety of risks with 
requisite mechanisms for their assessment 
and mitigation. The Company actively adds to 
these especially when it comes to ESG aspects 
and is increasing the span of risks evaluated 
and addressed. Risk Management is overseen 
by the Risk Management Committee of the 
Board. 
For more details on its composition and Terms 
of Reference, please refer to the Corporate 
Governance Report section of the Annual 
Report on Pages 99-121.
There is an appropriate delegation of risk 
management and resource allocation across 
departments and locations with robust disaster 
recovery and business continuity plans in 
place.
For more details on the latter, please refer to 
Principle 6, Leadership Indicator 5.

Information 
Security and 
Data Privacy
Risk
Rising cyber threats endanger 
data privacy, risking sensitive 
information’s confidentiality. 
Additional risks like USB 
data leaks and remote work 
vulnerabilities exacerbate 
this threat. Neglecting data 
protection and intellectual 
property safeguards can result 
in financial, reputational, and 
legal repercussions, disrupting 
business and affecting 
stakeholders.
The Company has a robust Information 
Security Management System (“ISMS”) 
in place which allows it to effectively deal 
with cyber security threats and meet its 
data privacy obligations. The Company 
continues to be certified by ISO 27001 and 
has appropriate support from its vendors 
and partners to address any threats. These 
are augmented with requisite training and 
awareness for all personnel as well as strong 
disaster management and business continuity 
measures.

related challenges, targets, and achievements:
Crafting a sustainable roadmap
Driving sustainability is a strategic priority for the Company. We have 
developed a 2030 strategy mapping out our sustainability goals. We have 
identified key sustainability metrics, set annual targets for each plant 
and established a robust review mechanism to monitor the performance 
against each target on a monthly basis to ensure we drive sustainable 
change. 
At Endurance, we have achieved a carbon-neutrality percentage of 35% 
in FY 2023-24 against 22.6% in FY 2022-23. We aim to achieve 50% carbon 
neutrality by 2030 by using cleaner and renewable sources of energy viz. 
solar power, wind power, LPG and natural gas in place of electric power 
and furnace oil, driving energy conservation projects and creating carbon 
sinks through dense forests. We are also committed to achieve zero waste 
to landfill across all our plants by 2030.

in environmental and social impacts among the total count of R&D projects.
* Over ~50% of the company’s capex investments are in plant and machinery, which by design are more energy-efficient and ergonomically improved 
and safer equipment. The company has not considered those investments as direct environmental or social benefits, though they would reduce the 
environmental impact and improve worker safety during operations. The additional capital investment made by the Company during the financial year 
2022-23 on energy conservation equipment was H 219.94 million while in the financial year 2023-24 it was  H 143.11 million.
2.	
a.    Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? 
	
	
Yes, The Company has sourcing procedures aligned with sustainability requirements wherein supplier selection includes 
criteria including quality, safety, and localization parameters. The Company has developed a supplier code of conduct that 
is being implemented across suppliers. Additionally, there is a focus on the most important suppliers for the Company’s 
“bill of materials” spend category. The Company actively engages with them to help monitor and assist them in reducing 
the environmental impact of its suppliers. The Company has developed a 'Sustainability Index',  based on various aspects 
of environmental impact, including energy consumption, renewable energy use, water, waste, etc. The Company has 
established goals for supplier performance and conducts many capacity-building programs for its suppliers, as detailed in 
Principle 1 Leadership Indicator 1. The Company is in the process of expanding these to other categories and suppliers.
	
b.	
If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?
	
	
The Company has incorporated sustainability criteria into its supplier selection process while sourcing raw materials. The 
Company has prioritized specific important and larger suppliers to focus on for driving sustainability improvements. Thus 
far, approximately 20 suppliers have undergone a rigorous assessment based on various sustainability parameters. These 
criteria include electricity consumption, renewable energy usage, thermal energy efficiency, water consumption, water 
recycling initiatives, and hazardous and non-hazardous waste generation.  Currently, these are the 'best-in-class' practices 
suppliers excelling on all of the Company’s parameters, and the Company will be outlining more specific norms in FY 2025 
for defining "sustainable sourcing" for key spend categories. Out of the 20 suppliers evaluated against the Company’s 
sustainability standards, 11 have achieved the requisite target sustainability index score. These suppliers collectively 
contribute 15% of the Bill of Parts (BOP). Efforts are underway to collaborate with the remaining suppliers to enhance their 
sustainability performance.

Grievance redressal meetings of all employees including contract labour are conducted every 
month. All aspects raised in the meeting are circulated with a clear action plan and responsibilities 
with target dates. The feedback is conveyed to the concerned person about progress/ compliances 
and feasibility.  The Company’s HRMS has a built-in grievance mechanism for employees and 
it also has a plant-level grievance committee. It is ensured that all the received complaints are 
addressed and resolved promptly considering the nature of the complaint. 
Employees and workers may also register their grievances to their immediate supervisor, 
for resolving the issue within a defined timeframe. In case of unsatisfactory resolution, the 
aggrieved party may present the grievance to the ‘Grievance Committee’ (‘GC’) in writing 
through the respective plant HR Head. The GC is chaired by the Plant /Operations Head 
and comprises the Plant HR Head, one official not less than the grade of Senior Officer, and 
two other members representing workmen. Where applicable, if the aggrieved worker is a 
union member, then the union committee is also given the option to nominate two of their 
representatives on the GC. 
Complaints, grievances and feedback received from employees and workers are discussed 
and resolved during town hall meetings, MD communication meetings, and other interactions 
between the employees and the HR function.
In addition, the Company has a Vigil Mechanism-cum-Whistle Blower Policy which provides 
an alternative for grievance redressal while protecting a whistle-blower from any potential 
discrimination, harassment, victimisation, or any other unfair employment practice. The policy 
is available at https://www.endurancegroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Whistle-

Occupational health and safety is a key priority for the Company. The Company is committed to ensuring a culture of 
“Safety First” and “Zero Harm”, which is driven by the Executive Leadership. The Company has a Health and Safety 
Policy supported by procedures, training, and monitoring mechanisms. Policies and systems across all plants are aligned 
with the guidelines and principles of the Occupational Health and Safety Management System. Currently, seven of the

The Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment Process (“HIRA”) followed at the Company is compliant with ISO 45001:2018 
and is operational across all company facilities. This systematic approach identifies and evaluates work-related hazards and 
associated risks for routine and non-routine activities. The systems and processes are assessed and validated through 
periodic internal reviews and external audits. Additionally, initiatives such as the Work Permit system, HSE internal audits, 
and Gemba walks are in place. These proactive measures aim to enhance the health and safety of all workers and visitors 
at the Company’s locations. There are also non-routine practices like spot checks, management walkarounds, and other 
feedback mechanisms in place to create and implement appropriate control measures to eliminate or reduce the identified 
risks to acceptable levels.
c.	
Whether you have processes for workers to report work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such risks. 
(Yes/No)
	
Yes, the Company has implemented processes and procedures for workers to identify, remove themselves (and others) from 
any hazards, and report the same to the designated safety officials for remedial action. Employees use the company's online 
safety portal to report any harmful conditions, near-misses, or dangers in operational activities or systems. In addition, each 
facility has suggestion boxes (which are checked after each shift) for workers to report accidents, hazards, or near misses 
related to their duties. There is also appropriate supervisory support for reporting hazards quickly. In compliance with the 
Factories Act, every operational facility has also established a safety committee, which serves as a platform for reporting 
work-related hazards and risk mitigation. Regular meetings are held where employee representatives discuss and develop 
plans to address workforce concerns with defined accountability and timelines.
d.	
Do the employees/workers of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services? (Yes/ No)

non-occupational medical and healthcare services. These include a Comprehensive Health Benefit Plan with perks like 
free doctor consultations and discounts on diagnostic tests and medicines, assistance in planning surgeries, and access 
to various health-related resources. The employee assistance program provides counselling support, covering personal 
issues, relationships, parenting, and workplace challenges. Webinars are organized on mental wellness and activities such

Leadership Indicators
1.	
Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and social 
topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board? (Leadership)
	
The Board has delegated the responsibility of stakeholder consultation on environmental and social issues to the Executive 
Leadership of the Company. To facilitate this, functional leaders have a structured engagement mechanism, as discussed in 
Principle 4, Essential Indicator 2 (above). The feedback received through this mechanism is presented to the Board through the 
Board Familiarization Programmes, which are discussed in Principle 1, Essential Indicator 1. Investor and shareholder concerns are 
presented to the Stakeholder Relationship Committee, while the CSR Committee reviews input received from the communities 
on their needs. These committees and Board Familiarization Programmes serve as crucial platforms for fostering dialogue 
and gathering insights from the Company’s stakeholders. This ensures that the Board remains informed about stakeholder 
perspectives and concerns, thereby supporting informed decision-making on matters related to economic, environmental, and 
social aspects.
2.	
Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, and social 
topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these topics were 
incorporated into the policies and activities of the entity. 
	
Stakeholder consultation by various functional teams is leveraged for the identification and management of environmental and 
social topics.  
	
In the supplier management function, actions are taken based on supplier input gathered from EVA (Endurance Vendor 
Association) meetings. The consensus of the EVA committee on category-wise PPM revision facilitates continual improvement in 
policies. Any policy changes undergo discussion with the EVA before implementation for enhanced alignment and incorporation 
of their inputs. Efforts have been directed toward reducing Vehicle TAT (Turnaround Time) at the Company’s plants. An 
improvement in TAT of 20-25% has been achieved, and that of 44% for ETL transmission. Specific timeslots have been allocated 
to suppliers for inward activities at the Company’s plants to mitigate long waiting times. The Company has implemented ASN & 
QR codes to fast capture inward details while gate entry and GRN and to smoothen the Goods Receive Process. 
	
For distributors in the aftermarket business, the Company conducts bi-annual Distributor Governing Council meetings to gather 
market feedback and best practices, driving enhancements for the Company and our distributors. Implemented improvements 
include rationalizing discounts, enhancing packaging, emailing invoice copies post-billing, introducing customer-friendly policies, 
and launching a digital loyalty program. These actions demonstrate the Company's commitment to continual improvement and 
stronger partnerships within our distribution network for superior customer service. 
	
For the Company’s labour workforce, based on input received from the union, the wage settlement includes incentives for 
regular attendance. Based on feedback from the workforce, there is an attendance incentive for contract labour /apprentices to 
ensure the availability of skilled labour in critical production areas and attract more skilled manpower.
3.	
Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/ marginalized 
stakeholder groups. 
	
The Company engages with vulnerable and marginalized communities to ensure their voices are heard. The Company’s CSR 
initiatives are focused on serving these groups. As part of the CSR commitment, the Company chose four villages for the 
implementation of the Village Development Project (“VDP”) to be implemented by Sevak Trust in the Chh. Sambhajinagar 
district of Maharashtra. During the execution, the CSR Team visited an old age home, that catered specifically to mentally 
challenged elderly individuals, operating without external aid. The facility was housed in rented premises. Senior Management 
members from the Company conducted visits to assess the situation firsthand. As a result of these visits, it was resolved to 
construct and donate an old age home to the proprietor of the existing facility. The CSR Team worked with the village Panchayat 
to secure a parcel of land spanning 20,000 square feet for the construction of a facility capable of accommodating 50 beds, in the 
Financial Year 2024-25. The Company commenced the construction of an old age home in Borwadi, featuring expansive green 
spaces, alongside committing to provide regular medical services to the residents of this establishment.

10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted 
by your company to reduce the usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the 
practices adopted to manage such wastes.
	
Circularity, resource efficiency, waste minimization, and management are aspects material to the Company. The Company has 
implemented 20 projects for input parts around the theme of packaging minimization where returnable bins are implemented 
in FY 2023-24. Similarly, returnable packaging is used with customers and aftermarket parts are packaged in customer-provided 
packaging thereby reducing waste generation in the value chain. The Company has adopted waste management practices in 
line with the compliance requirements of the relevant Pollution Control Board and Environment Protection rules covering:
	
•	
Recording and monitoring of waste generation and disposal  
	
•	
Selection and related waste processing agreements with waste collection agencies are in line with regulatory obligations.
	
•	
Recycling and disposal of hazardous waste are performed through PCB-authorized agencies. 
	
•	
The EPR mechanism has been developed in line with CPCB guidelines (Refer to Principle 2 Essential Indicators 4)
	
All sites are equipped with comprehensive waste collection, handling, and storage infrastructure, meticulously designed to meet 
regulatory requirements and prioritize health and safety considerations. For instance, the Company’s scrap yard facilities have 
robust engineering features such as cemented impervious floors, designated compartments for different types of waste, and 
effective fire protection measures. The Company’s waste management practices promote the elimination, reduction, recycling, 
and reuse of waste within its operations and across its value chain. Some examples are as below:
	
•	
Returnable packaging: Collaborating with both suppliers and customers to implement returnable packaging solutions for 
both raw materials and finished goods.
	
•	
Metal waste recycling: Reutilizing metallic waste derived from semi-finished casting, cutting, and machining operations by 
reintegrating it through melting furnaces.
	
•	
Fit-for-purpose packaging: Tailoring aftermarket product packaging to precisely match customer specifications, thereby 
optimizing the utilization of packaging materials.
	
The proportion of recycled waste has increased from 89% to 91% in FY 2023-24, while waste incinerated and waste to landfill 
have decreased. Please refer to Essential Indicator 9 (above) for details. Endurance teams consistently evaluate opportunities to 
enhance waste processing by prioritizing the waste hierarchy for both hazardous and non-hazardous waste. Key initiatives aimed 
at minimizing hazardous and toxic chemicals in our products and processes:
	
•	
Shifting from thinner-based paint to water-based paint wherever feasible 
	
•	
Hard chrome and Nickel recovery to mitigate the discharge of heavy metals in the effluent.
	
•	
Centralized coolant circulation and recycling system for enhanced coolant life. Installation of coolant filtration system by 
substituting paper-based filtration system to reduce oil-contaminated paper waste.
	
•	
Installing decanters, and volute press filters to reduce moisture content in effluent sludge.
	
•	
Reclaiming of sand in low-density pressure die-casting 
	
•	
Use of less hazardous liners in braking systems.
	
Please refer to Leadership Indicator 6 where the Company has noted an adverse impact of hazardous substance usage by its 
supplier. Consequently, a declaration on hazardous substance usage (if any) is being taken from suppliers per customer-specific 
requirements or country-specific laws.

Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan? Give details in 100 words/ web link.
	
Ensuring requisite business continuity and disaster recovery management plans from an IT perspective are integral to the 
Company’s Enterprise Risk Management process. These are a part of ISMS which ensures business continuity in scenarios 
of natural disasters at the main Data Centre (DC) site, failure of any business application system/database, or a cyber-attack 
incident. These plans are supported by the preparation of RARTP (Risk Assessment and Risk Treatment Plan) for the information 
assets register and practices related to data backup management, DC-DR drills, etc.

Disclose any significant adverse impact to the environment, arising from the value chain of the entity. What mitigation or 
adaptation measures have been taken by the entity in this regard.
	
During a routine inspection of one of Endurance's customers, a plating supplier's use of hexavalent chromium material was 
identified. Hexavalent chromium is considered hazardous and is banned due to its environmental impact. Consequently, the 
supplier was required to switch to trivalent chromium. Additionally, awareness has been raised throughout the supply chain 
regarding the prohibition of hexavalent chromium for plating purposes. A test method has also been developed to identify 
hexavalent chromium, thus enabling the detection of any unauthorized usage.
