BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITY & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT
(Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) is the practice of companies disclosing information about their 
environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance. It goes beyond 昀椀nancial reporting to provide stakeholders with 
a comprehensive view of a company's non-昀椀nancial impacts and contributions to sustainable development. BRSR covers 
topics such as environmental impact, social responsibility, and governance practices, aiming to promote transparency and 
accountability.)

1.
Waste 
management
Risk
Inadequate waste management 
poses 
risks 
to 
electronics 
manufacturing 
companies, 
including 
regulatory 
non-
compliance, reputational damage, 
increased operational costs and 
environmental impact. Improper 
handling and disposal of waste 
materials can lead to pollution, 
legal liabilities and negative public 
health, impacting the Company's 
performance and sustainability.
To effectively manage waste 
and 
hazardous 
materials, 
we 
implement 
measures 
to 
address 
present 
and 
future 
risks, 
mitigating 
environmental 
impact 
through 
proper 
disposal 
and containment. We also 
adopt eco-friendly materials, 
optimise consumption and 
closely monitor usage for a 
sustainable approach.
Negative
2.
Community 
wellbeing
Opportunity
Community well-being presents 
an opportunity for electronics 
manufacturing companies to build 
strong 
relationships, 
enhance 
brand reputation and foster long-
term 
sustainability. 
Engaging 
in initiatives that support local 
communities, such as education, 
job creation and social welfare 
programmes, can create positive 
social impact and contribute to a 
thriving business ecosystem.

3.
Business 
Ethics and 
governance
Risk
Lack of business ethics, integrity 
and proper governance poses 
risks to electronics manufacturing 
companies, including damage to 
reputation, legal consequences, 
loss of stakeholder trust and 
昀椀nancial losses. Engaging in 
unethical 
practices, 
such 
as 
bribery or fraud, can lead to legal 
disputes, 
regulatory 
penalties 
and erosion of the Company's 
credibility and long-term viability.
At Kaynes Technology, we 
place a paramount emphasis 
on 
business 
ethics 
and 
governance, 
recognising 
its crucial role in driving 
sustainable 
business 
performance and promoting 
transparency. To uphold these 
values, we have implemented 
several 
mechanisms 
and 
policies, such as the code of 
conduct, risk management 
policy, 
Board 
Diversity 
policy 
and 
Related 
Party 
Transactions policy. These 
policies work together to 
govern and ensure ethical 
practices 
throughout 
the 
Company, fostering a culture 
of integrity and responsible 
decision making.
Negative
4.
Material 
sourcing 
ef昀椀ciency
Risk
Inef昀椀cient material sourcing poses 
risks to electronics manufacturing 
companies, 
including 
supply 
chain 
disruptions, 
increased 
costs, reputational damage and 
environmental impact. Reliance 
on non-sustainable or unreliable 
sources can result in material 
shortages, 
price 
昀氀uctuations, 
ethical concerns and failure to 
meet stakeholder expectations 
for responsible sourcing, affecting 
the Company's operations and 
competitiveness.
The rationale behind material 
sourcing 
ef昀椀ciency 
and 
building an ef昀椀cient supply 
chain is to ensure a smooth 
production 
function 
and 
meet 
customer 
demands 
effectively. These efforts have 
a signi昀椀cant impact on the 
overall business, as they lead 
to 
streamlined 
operations, 
reduced costs and enhanced 
customer 
satisfaction, 
ultimately 
contributing 
to 
the Company's success and 
growth.
Negative
5.
Product 
design 
and Lifecycle 
management
Risk
Inadequate product design and 
lifecycle management pose risks 
to 
electronics 
manufacturing 
companies, 
including 
product 
failures, 
market 
rejection, 
legal 
liabilities 
and 
negative 
environmental 
impact. 
Poorly 
designed products, insuf昀椀cient 
quality control and lack of end-
of-life planning can lead to safety 
issues, customer dissatisfaction 
and 
non-compliance 
with 
regulations, 
jeopardising 
the 
Company's 
reputation 
and 
昀椀nancial success.
To effectively manage use 
of 
hazardous 
materials, 
we 
implement 
measures 
to 
address 
present 
and 
future 
risks, 
mitigating 
environmental impact through 
gradually 
adopting 
eco-
friendly materials, optimising 
consumption 
and 
closely 
monitoring 
usage 
for 
a 
sustainable approach.

Risk
Inadequate

However, 
we 
closely 
monitor 
critical 
aspects 
like 
access controls, physical security 
and logical security to ensure 
comprehensive protection.
As per the risk management 
roadmap, necessary actions 
are implemented to mitigate 
the adverse effects of actual 
or potential threats.

7.
Customer 
Satisfaction
Opportunity
The signi昀椀cance of customer 
satisfaction lies in elevating our 
Net Promoter Score (NPS), which 
directly correlates with improved 
customer loyalty and advocacy. 
By 
prioritising 
customer 
satisfaction, we cultivate a loyal 
customer base who are more 
likely to recommend our products 
and services to others.
