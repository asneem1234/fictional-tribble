In addition, we are focused on reducing our overall

committed to managing and mitigating risks through 
the entire product lifecycle and improving its value 
offerings to meet the needs and aspirations of all its

environmentally friendly but also improves 
combustion efﬁciency. To ensure sustained

projects include expanding the capacity of the 
Ammonia Plant, Phosphoric Acid Plant, and Sulphuric 
Acid Plant. FACT intends to fund these projects 
internally, demonstrating its commitment to long-
term growth. FACT has a rich history, celebrating 76 
years of producing fertilizers and serving the nation.

sustainable growth, adopting industry best practices. 
By ensuring a stable supply of fertilizers, FACT 
contributes to national food security.

a) Formulated the combination of Insecticidal 
fertilizer (insecticides combined with 
fertilizer). It is a preparation containing 
organic substrate in combination with 
inorganic pesticide which may serve both as 
an organic fertilizer as well as an insecticide. 
Such formulations are desirable in 
agricultural due to the multiple beneﬁts 
conveyed via single application/system, 
provide nutrients for the plant growth while 
eliminating or controlling unwanted insects 
that affect the health and vitality of the 
desirable plants.
b) Formulated a simple and effective 
composition for liquid Calcium Nitrate 
fertilizer. Liquid calcium nitrate provides 
nitrogen, essential for the growth and 
development of crops, necessary for the 
synthesis of chlorophyll as well as being a 
major component of vitamins and energy 
transfer systems of plants. Calcium helps to 
reduce soil acidity.

FACT has implemented a comprehensive solid waste 
management plan. Non-hazardous solid waste is 
collected from its point of generation and stored in 
designated on-site facilities. Metal scrap, e-waste, and 
plastic waste are managed through the Metal Scrap 
Trading Corporation (MSTC). Bio-medical waste is safely 
disposed of via the IMA – IMAGE facility. Used batteries 
and other waste are handled by authorized re-processors 
through a buy-back policy. Hazardous waste categories 
include spent catalysts, sulphur muck, waste oil, lead 
scrap, and ETP sludge, all of which are safely disposed of 
by authorized re-processors. Waste oil is recycled for use 
as lubricant in conveyor idlers and other machinery.
