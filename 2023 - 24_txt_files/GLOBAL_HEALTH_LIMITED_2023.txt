and policies in place. These policies are openly accessible to all employees in digital format. Further, the Company does

policy that applies to all their employees. Additionally, the Company operates an open-door policy for grievance resolution. 
This approach is non-hierarchical, allowing any party to approach any level of authority at any time, including, Immediate 
Supervisor/Reporting Manager, Functional Head & HR.

to higher operational 
costs, exposure to energy 
price volatility, and 
increased greenhouse 
gas emissions, resulting 
in regulatory penalties 
and reputational harm. 
Dependence on non-

Company aims to mitigate 
our impact on the 
environment and promote 
sustainability.

leading to operational 
disruptions, regulatory 
fines, and negative public 
perception. Water scarcity 
can directly impact 
hospital operations and 
patient care.
The company aims to 
achieve water neutrality 
and positivity by efficiently 
managing water 
resources, utilizing water 
treatment plants, and 
offsetting usage through 
sustainable initiatives.

GOVERNANCE, LEADERSHIP, AND OVERSIGHT
7.	
Statement by director responsible for the 
business responsibility report, highlighting 
ESG related challenges, targets and 
achievements (listed entity has flexibility 
regarding the placement of this disclosure)
Our unwavering commitment to sustainable growth is 
intrinsically linked to our prioritization and integration of 
environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices 
across every aspect of our operations. This dedication 
to environmental stewardship is evident in the state-of-
the-art infrastructure and patient-centric design of our 
greenfield hospitals. Each of these facilities is designed to 
optimize natural light, which not only reduces electricity 
consumption but also enhances patient recovery outcomes. 
Our upcoming hospital in Noida has already received pre-
certification as a Green Building under the IGBC Green 
Healthcare Facilities Rating System by the CII-Indian Green 
Building Council.
In addition, we have made significant investments in 
water recycling and treatment systems to maximize water 
efficiency. Our greenfield facilities in Gurugram, Lucknow, 
and Patna operate as Zero Liquid Discharge units, ensuring 
minimal water wastage and a substantial reduction in 
freshwater consumption.
At Medanta, we take pride in the fact that 50% of our 
workforce is female, including over 600 female doctors, 
underscoring our commitment to fostering a diverse and 
inclusive workplace. Furthermore, Medanta's commitment 
to healthcare extends well beyond the confines of our 
hospitals. We are actively engaged in community welfare 
through initiatives aimed at raising awareness, promoting 
health education, and improving access to essential 
healthcare services. During the year, Medanta, in partnership 
with the Uttar Pradesh Government, launched the "TB 
Free Uttar Pradesh" initiative, which aims to eliminate 
tuberculosis in the state. This initiative complements our 
ongoing "Medanta’s Mission TB-Free" program, launched in 
collaboration with the Government of Haryana in 2015.

Annual Report 2023-24
GLOBAL HEALTH LIMITED
10.	
a.	
Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the 
entity? (Yes/ No). If yes, the coverage such system? 
	
An occupational health and safety management system (OHSMS) includes health and safety policies, systems, 
standards, and records, and involves incorporating health and safety activities and programs into  other business 
processes. 
	
Medanta hospitals have implemented a comprehensive OHSMS across all locations. This system aims to 
provide a safe environment by managing risks to patients, families, visitors, and staff by organizing safety plans, 
programs, upgrading or replacing systems, buildings or components needed for the continued operation of 
a safe and effective facility. Key elements include:
	
	
Establishment of a hospital safety committee 
	
	
Implementation of specific safety policies 
	
	
Mandatory health screenings and immunizations 
	
	
Regular safety audits
	
	
Proactive risk assessment tools like Hazard Identification and Risk Analysis (HIRA) and Failure Mode Effects 
Analysis (FMEA). 
	
The Company conducts regular training and awareness programs for employees, ensuring adherence to safety 
protocols and providing personal protective equipment (PPE) to mitigate occupational hazards.
	
As a part of health and safety measures, Medanta conducts annual health check-ups, regular counselling of 
staff, Hepatitis B vaccinations, and ensure the availability of PPEs being standard across all locations. Medanta 
hospitals also adhere to NABH standards, ensuring a high level of safety and quality in healthcare services. 
Through continuous monitoring, training, and a robust governance structure, the Company maintain a safe 
working environment for their employees, thereby promoting overall occupational health and safety.
b.	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-
routine basis by the entity?
	
The Company adopts a systematic approach to conduct hazard identification and risk assessment across 
their operations. Routine processes entail reviews of departmental risk registers, ensuring that all potential 
hazards and risks are documented and updated annually. Moreover, proactive risk assessments, including 
Hazard Vulnerability Analysis (HVA), infection control evaluations, and WHO Hospital Safety Index checks, are 
conducted regularly to stay ahead of emerging risks.
	
Non-routine methods are equally comprehensive. Ad-hoc risk identification allows staff to report hazards as 
they arise, ensuring that even unforeseen risks are promptly addressed. Incident reporting, facilitated through 
an online system, captures near misses, adverse events, and sentinel events, triggering in-depth root cause 
analyses to understand underlying factors contributing to incidents.
	
The prioritization and management of identified risks involve sophisticated tools such as HIRA and FMEA. 
These tools enable the Company to assess risks organization-wide, facilitating strategic decision-making and 
resource allocation for risk mitigation efforts. Additionally, periodic facility/safety rounds and HIRA audits ensure 
ongoing vigilance, contributing to a culture of continuous improvement in safety and operational effectiveness 
across the organization.
c.	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove 
themselves from such risks. (Yes/No)
	
Yes, Medanta has established processes aimed at ensuring workers can effectively report work-related hazards 
and take necessary steps to remove themselves from risks. An Incident Reporting System plays a pivotal role 
in this framework by actively encouraging staff members to promptly report near misses and adverse events. 
This system not only fosters transparency but also enhances the Company’s ability to identify potential hazards 
in real-time.
23
	
Moreover, an emphasis is placed on the importance of ad-hoc risk identification, empowering all employees 
to proactively identify and mitigate risks as they perform their routine duties. This proactive approach ensures 
that potential hazards are addressed promptly, contributing to a safer working environment for everyone.
	
To further strengthen safety initiatives, the Company promotes anonymous reporting mechanisms. This allows 
employees to raise concerns and report incidents without fear of reprisal, thereby fostering a culture where 
safety is prioritized, and issues can be addressed promptly and effectively.
	
Additionally, Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is employed as a critical tool in Medanta’s safety management strategy. 
This process helps the Company delve deeper into incidents to uncover underlying causes and systemic issues. 
By identifying root causes, Medanta can implement targeted corrective actions to prevent recurrence and 
continuously improve their safety protocols.
d.	
Do the employees/ worker of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare 
services? (Yes/No)
	
At Medanta, all employees enjoy access to a diverse array of non-occupational medical services designed to 
prioritize their health and well-being. This comprehensive support includes regular health check-ups and 
prompt medical attention whenever necessary. The facilities adhere to stringent protocols addressing work-
related accidents, potential exposure to infectious diseases, and incidents involving radiation.
	
The Company offers free outpatient consultations, discounted diagnostics and medicine to employees. In cases 
requiring hospitalization, employees typically benefit from coverage under the provided health insurance plan. 
Moreover, all employees are enrolled in a health insurance program that extends across the organization, with 
specific benefits tailored to schemes such as ESIC.

of addressing all observations identified during assessments to ensure continuous improvement in their safety 
practices and working conditions. These assessments were conducted through comprehensive internal safety 
audits at all five hospitals, which involve a detailed examination of safety protocols, equipment, and procedures

4.	 Do you have a focal point (Individual/ Committee) responsible for addressing human rights 
impacts or issues caused or contributed to by the business? (Yes/No)
	
The Company has established an Employee Grievance Committee that serves as a focal point for addressing 
any issues or concerns within the workforce. This dedicated committee provides a structured platform where 
employees can confidently raise grievances, knowing that their voices will be heard, and their concerns 
given the utmost attention and consideration. By prioritizing a supportive and responsive mechanism, the 
Company empowers its employees and cultivates a culture of open communication, fostering a harmonious 
and conducive work environment.
5.	 Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights 
issues?
	
The Company places paramount importance on upholding human rights principles throughout their 
operations and in collaboration with their business partners. Medanta remains committed to providing equal 
employment opportunities, ensuring that no discrimination based on disability, gender, caste, religion, race, 
state, background, or color impedes their workforce’s inclusivity. 
	
To effectively address and resolve issues and concerns within the workforce, Medanta has established a 
dedicated employee grievance committee. This committee serves as an invaluable platform where employees 
can confidently voice their grievances, secure in the knowledge that their concerns will be carefully listened to 
and duly addressed. The grievance redressal process begins with the aggrieved employee approaching their 
HOD (Head of Department) or supervisor with details of their grievance. The HOD/supervisor then investigates 
the situation and offers redressal based on relevant policies. If the grievance cannot be resolved or the employee 
is unsatisfied, the matter is escalated to Human Resource (HR) team. HR refers the case to a grievance redressal 
committee. If the committee cannot resolve the issue or the employee remains unsatisfied, the matter is 
escalated to the CEO/CMD (Chief Executive Officer/Chairman and Managing Director).
	
Furthermore, as part of their comprehensive approach to safeguarding human rights, the Company has 
implemented several policies. These include a Whistleblower Policy, a POSH (Prevention of Sexual Harassment) 
Policy, and a Code of Conduct Policy. These policies are specifically designed to tackle and resolve grievances 
arising from human rights issues, underscoring Medanta’s unwavering commitment to maintaining a 
workplace environment that is fair, respectful, and conducive to the well-being of all employees.

8.	 Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and 
harassment cases.
	
To mitigate adverse consequences for complainants in cases of discrimination and harassment, Medanta has 
established an Employee Grievance Committee, which promptly addresses and resolves workforce issues. This 
committee provides a platform for employees to voice grievances, ensuring their concerns are acknowledged 
and given due consideration. Medanta’s grievance redressal policy offers a structured framework for handling 
sensitive matters.
	
Under the provisions of Medanta’s POSH policy, any individual can file a written complaint within three months 
of the incident, extendable by another three months if justified. Complaints, including evidence and witness 
information, can be submitted to any internal committee (IC) member and must be forwarded by managers 
or HR within 24 hours. The complainant may request conciliation before an inquiry, excluding monetary 
settlements. If conciliation fails or is breached, the IC conducts an inquiry, which must be completed within

2.	 Steps taken to inform and educate consumers, especially vulnerable and marginalised 
consumers, about safe and responsible usage of products and services.
	
The Company prioritizes patient education and the clear communication of patient rights and responsibilities. 
To achieve this, these rights and responsibilities are displayed prominently within the hospitals. Upon admission, 
hospital staff provide patients with essential information and literature about their care.
	
Throughout their time at Medanta’s hospitals, patients have access to a variety of educational resources 
designed to help them make informed decisions. These resources include pamphlets, brochures, signage, 
audio-visual aids, online films, FAQs, and personal counselling. To cater to diverse patient needs, the Company 
also offers multilingual material and access to interpreters.
	
Informed consent is a vital part of the patient education process. Clinicians thoroughly explain treatment 
options to enable patients to make knowledgeable decisions. Additionally, the multidisciplinary care team 
discusses the patient's condition and treatment plan with both the patient and their family, ensuring everyone 
involved is well-informed.
	
Medication education is another crucial aspect. Doctors, nurses, and dieticians educate patients about the safe 
use of medications, including potential drug interactions and the dangers associated with high-alert drugs 
before administration.
	
Patient education also covers safety practices such as fall prevention, infection control, and hygiene. 
Understanding that care continues beyond the hospital stay, Medanta provides patients with detailed discharge 
instructions. These instructions cover lifestyle changes, wound care, physiotherapy, implant usage, parenting 
practices, immunizations, and other relevant topics to support their ongoing health and recovery.
