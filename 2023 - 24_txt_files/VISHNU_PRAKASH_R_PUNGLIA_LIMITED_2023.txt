1
Employee 
satisfaction 
and Retention
Risk
A high turnover rate within 
a company often signifies a 
lack of employee contentment. 
This elevated turnover not 
only escalates the expenses 
associated with recruiting and 
instructing new personnel but 
also heightens the jeopardy of 
adverse effects on the company’s 
operations, particularly in pivotal 
positions. Furthermore, it can 
cast a shadow on the company’s 
reputation among investors.
The company is 
currently engaged 
in comprehending 
the perspectives 
and evaluations of 
its employees. By 
acknowledging and 
addressing their 
issues, the company 
is fostering enhanced 
openness within its 
workforce.
Positive
2
Operational 
health and 
safety
Risk
The company’s infrastructure 
projects typically entail significant 
hazards, including the operation 
of substantial machinery and 
excavation work. In the absence 
of proper safety protocols, there 
is an elevated potential for 
accidents among the workforce.
The company is 
assigning skilled 
engineers and seasoned 
staff across different 
sectors to guarantee 
the health and safety 
of its employees in the 
workplace.

Business 
Ethics
opportunity
By bolstering its dedication to 
ethical conduct, the company can 
bolster trust among stakeholders, 
enhance its brand image, and 
ensure enduring viability. This 
strategy provides the company 
with a unique position in the 
marketplace, appealing to clients 
and investors who prioritize social 
responsibility.
The Company is 
committed to strong 
ethical behaviours 
leading to good 
cooperate governance. 
Positive 
4
Concentrated 
area and 
Clients
Risk 
Over-reliance on specific 
geographic areas or client 
segments may expose us 
to market fluctuations and 
economic downturns in those 
regions or industries.
Focused expertise in 
concentrated areas can 
lead to deeper market 
penetration, stronger 
client relationships, 
and the potential for 
premium pricing due to 
specialized knowledge.
Negative 
opportunity
Focused expertise in concentrated 
areas can lead to deeper market 
penetration, stronger client 
relationships, and the potential 
for premium pricing due to 
specialized knowledge.
Positive
5
Technology 
Upgradation
opportunity
Investing in technological 
advancements can streamline 
operations, enhance product/
service offerings, and improve 
overall efficiency. This presents 
opportunities for innovation, 
cost reduction, and maintaining 
a competitive edge in an 
increasingly digital marketplace.
Given the nature 
of its business, the 
company necessitates 
the ongoing adoption of 
the latest technological 
equipment, which 
in turn leads to an 
expanded market 
reach.
