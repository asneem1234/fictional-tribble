REPORT
BACKGROUND 
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”), has put in place the 
Business Responsibility & Sustainability Reporting (“BRSR”) framework for 
top 1,000 listed entities [based on market capitalisation on BSE Limited 
(“BSE”) and National Stock Exchange of India Limited (“NSE”)] pursuant 
to the amendments under SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“Listing Regulations”) (as amended 
from time to time), which requires Listed Companies to disclose 
information under the 9 (Nine) principles of the National Guidelines on 
Responsible Business Conduct (“NGRBC”).
SEBI has updated the BRSR Reporting format/framework for the Financial 
Year (“FY”) 2023-24 after incorporating new Key Performance Indicators 
(“KPIs”) of BRSR Core.
Our BRSR Report includes our responses to questions on our practice and 
performance on key principles defined by Regulation 34(2)(f) of Listing 
Regulations, covering topics across Environment, Social, Governance 
and Stakeholder relationships. Further, the Company has also included 
separate section on Environment, Social and Governance (“ESG”) 
initiatives in the Annual Report of the Company.
BRSR Report based on NGRBC consists of three sections as below:
Section A provides a broad overview of the business, its offerings, 
business & operations footprint, employees, holding, subsidiary & 
associate companies, CSR and transparency.
Section B covers management and process disclosures related to 
the businesses aimed at demonstrating the structures, policies and 
processes put in place towards adopting the NGRBC Principles and

environment by using less energy, water and reducing waste. By minimizing energy, water, and waste, 
the Company is not only reducing environmental footprint but also setting an example for responsible 
business practices.
During the year, the Company has acquired 2 business premises in Ahmedabad & Bangalore and

Furthermore, in order to minimize the ecological footprint of sourcing activities, the company has adopted 
a Sustainable Sourcing and Preferential Procurement Policy. This Policy aims to reduce carbon emissions, 
preserve biodiversity, conserve water resources, and avoid deforestation. Additionally, it promotes the 
economic empowerment of historically underprivileged individuals and businesses and ensures fair labor 
practices, safe working conditions, and respect for human rights throughout the supply chain. The said

10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the

We strive to reduce waste and recycle as much as possible. Our waste primarily comprises of foodwaste, 
paper, plastic and e-waste.
There is segregation of dry and wet waste and the solid waste management is done by recycling paper, 
tissue, plastic bottles and cardboard waste.
Given the nature of the business, there is no usage of toxic and hazardous chemicals by the Company. The 
Company has adopted waste management practices in the manner mentioned below:
Curbing generation of plastic waste: We have stopped procurement of plastic stationery and encourage 
our employees to use glass bottles at our offices to reduce the number of plastic bottles being discarded 
after use.
Reducing paper and printing consumption: We have implemented strong measures for digitising processes 
to reduce the need for paper. Further minimising the usage of paper across offices is an ongoing activity. 
Customer accounts have now transitioned to digital opening. The documents required as supporting are 
also uploaded digitally; accounts are being opened without any paper consumption. Paper based Office 
stationeries also have now been stopped apart from the mandatory ones.
E-waste management: IT waste are outsourced to vendor which disposes-of the wastes as per proper 
waste disposal mechanism. Our e-waste broadly includes computers, servers, scanners, UPSs, batteries, air 
conditioners, etc. All such e-wastes are being disposed of through registered e-waste vendors.
Food wastage management: The Company has been monitoring food wastage at the Head Office and 
other locations and the same is communicated to the employees through a board put up in the cafeteria.

environment, less expensive and 
offers health benefits such as 
fluoride that may be lacking in 
many bottled water products.

used for solid wastes.
Older toilet valves models would 
use as much as 15 liters per flush, a 
dual toilet loaves flush system uses 
only about 7 liters each flush.
