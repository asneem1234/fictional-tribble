Energy
Management
Risk
Given 
the 
mounting

management 
systems. 
Additionally, they prioritize 
the utilization of renewable 
energy sources and aim to

Waste
Management
Risk
Effective 
waste 
management is crucial 
for 
the 
Company 
to 
uphold 
responsible 
operations and ensure 
safety. Given the nature 
of its operations, the 
Company 
produces 
substantial 
waste, 
including solvents and 
chemicals 
potentially 
harmful 
to 
the 
environment and human 
health. 
Encouraging 
safe disposal practices 
is 
imperative 
for 
ensuring sound waste 
management.
The Company responsibly 
manages its solid waste 
by 
disposing 
of 
it 
at 
authorized 
landfills 
and 
incinerators according to its 
policy. Hazardous waste is 
directed to co-processing 
units, while over 10% of the 
quantity is recycled through 
established mechanisms.
Negative 
impact 
is 
endured due to measures 
of waste handling and 
management.
4
Climate
Change
Risk
Given 
the 
growing 
focus 
on 
governance 
concerning 
carbon 
emissions and climate 
change, it’s crucial for 
the Company to closely 
monitor 
exhaust 
and 
complex emissions to 
avoid financial losses 
in the form of fines and 
penalties.
The Company gives priority 
to 
utilizing 
renewable 
energy sources for powering 
its operations. Additionally, it 
invests in energy-efficient 
equipment and technologies 
to 
decrease 
energy 
consumption 
and 
lower 
greenhouse gas emissions. 
As part of its environmental 
stewardship, the company 
actively 
investigates 
opportunities 
for 
Carbon 
Capture, 
Utilization, 
and 
Storage (CCUS) to mitigate 
its carbon footprint. In the 
current year, the Company 
has 
commenced 
the 
implementation of a Solar 
Plant to power its operations, 
thereby reducing its carbon 
footprint.
Additional 
costs 
are 
incurred for the monitoring 
and 
management 
of 
emissions, 
resulting 
in 
negative implications.

Compliance
Risk
Ethical 
operations 
and governance is the 
reflection of responsible
compliance 
of 
the 
Company. 
Being, 
a 
chemical 
manufacturer 
it 
is 
critical 
for 
the 
company to be compliant 
with applicable set of 
regulations and norms 
and hence, avoid getting 
penalized.
The Company is dedicated 
to fulfilling all relevant legal 
obligations, ensuring that 
its operations fully comply 
with the law. To oversee 
compliance efforts, regular 
quarterly 
assessments 
are 
conducted. 
These 
assessments 
entail 
a 
comprehensive examination 
of processes, procedures, 
and practices to detect any 
instances of non-compliance 
or potential risks. Through 
proactive 
compliance 
monitoring, the Company 
promptly addresses issues 
and implements corrective 
actions.
Negative 
implications 
are 
observed 
due 
to 
investments 
to 
ensure 
compliance 
within 
the 
processes 
and 
Implications 
would 
be 
positive as the company 
adheres to Compliances 
and this outweighs the 
cost that would be incurred 
due to non compliance
6
Water & 
effluent
Risk
Water plays a critical role 
in 
multiple 
processes 
within the Company’s 
operations. Responsible 
management not only 
enhances 
stakeholder 
trust but also ensures 
the systematic discharge 
of 
effluents, 
thereby 
averting penalties.
The Company has robust 
initiatives 
to 
ensure 
100% wastewater effluent 
treatment as follows:
• 	
Karakhadi, 
Vadodara 
Plant 
contains 
an 
effluent 
treatment 
plant 
with 
primary 
(chemical), secondary 
(biological), 
and 
tertiary 
(disinfection) 
treatment facilities. 
• 	
Mahape Plant disposes 
off liquid effluent in a 
shared 
wastewater 
treatment plant.
•	
Dahej 
SEZ 
plant 
successfully 
operated 
a zero liquid discharge 
(ZLD) system, which 
processes 100% of the 
waste water  generated 
for 
recovering 
and 
recycling water.
Financial negative impact 
is incurred due to potential 
risk of inreased cost of 
waste water treatement.

Human Rights
Risk
Ensuring adherence to 
human rights throughout 
all 
operations 
and 
preventing any form of 
exploitation is paramount 
to the Company. Non-
compliance 
with 
human rights standards 
damages the Company’s 
reputation.
The Company upholds and 
respects the fundamental 
human 
rights 
of 
its 
employees, 
customers, 
and 
stakeholders. 
It 
is 
committed to fostering an 
inclusive and diverse work 
environment that promotes 
equality, non-discrimination, 
and 
fair 
treatment 
for 
all. 
Furthermore, 
the 
Company’s Prevention of 
Sexual Harassment (POSH) 
policy 
and 
whistleblower 
policy 
provide 
protection 
to 
complainants 
and 
offer guidance on raising 
concerns 
regarding 
misconduct 
and 
ill-
treatment.
Negative impact is incurred 
because 
of 
possible 
increased 
compliance 
costs, 
potential 
legal 
labilities and these risks 
may 
affect 
investor 
confidence, lead to higher 
operational expenses.
8
Business 
Ethics
Opportunity
Good governance and 
ethical operations lead to 
virtuous work outcomes. 
It is essential for the 
Company to prioritize 
transparent 
practices 
and 
uphold 
business 
ethics 
to 
enhance 
stakeholder trust.
The Company maintains the 
highest ethical standards, 
guided by its Code of 
Conduct, which applies to 
all employees and senior 
management. 
This 
code 
underscores their dedication 
to integrity, transparency, 
and responsible business 
practices. The HR Policy 
further 
solidifies 
this 
commitment by advocating 
for 
fairness, 
equal 
opportunity, 
and 
respect 
in 
employment 
matters. 
Upholding these policies 
ensures that ethical conduct 
remains central to their 
operations, fostering trust 
with stakeholders and the 
communities 
they 
serve. 
Additionally, the Company’s 
Whistleblower Policy offers 
guidance on reporting any 
misconduct or fraud within 
the organization.
Positive impact is incurred
financially. By prioritizing 
sustainability and ethically 
responsible 
practices, 
the 
company 
can 
tap 
into growing markets that 
value ethical standards, 
ultimately 
driving 
profitability and long-term 
growth.

Materials
Risk
To maintain continuous 
operations and deliver 
quality 
products, 
it 
is 
essential 
for 
the 
Company 
to 
ensure 
a 
steady 
supply 
of 
materials that are cost-
effective 
and 
meet 
quality standards.
The 
Company’s 
procurement team ensures 
that a large portion of 
essential 
raw 
materials 
is sourced from multiple 
suppliers. Furthermore, the 
Company cultivates strong, 
long-term relationships with 
suppliers to access raw 
resources at competitive 
prices. 
Additionally, 
the 
Company 
maintains 
sufficient inventory levels to 
mitigate associated risks.
Negative Implications, as 
Neogen Chemicals may 
face financial implications 
due to the volatility and 
rising costs of raw material 
like lithium which is crucial 
for product line.
13
Market 
Presence
Opportunity
It is essential for the
Company to outreach
to more customers and
penetrate deeper in the
market 
and 
enjoy 
growing
market base with multiple
profitable opportunities
Over the years, the Company 
has broadened its product 
range to serve a diverse 
customer base. The current 
portfolio comprises over 246 
products, applied across 
various industries in India, 
including pharmaceuticals, 
engineering 
fluids, 
electronic 
chemicals, 
polymer 
additives, 
agrochemical intermediates, 
water 
treatment, 
construction 
chemicals, 
aroma chemicals, specialty 
polymers, 
flavours 
and 
fragrances, with emerging 
applications in lithium-ion 
battery materials for energy 
storage and electric vehicle 
(EV) use.
Positive implications are 
due to increased market 
penetration and customer 
base.
14
Technology
Risk
Obsolescence risk refers 
to the potential for a 
business procedure or 
technology to become 
outdated, diminishing its 
competitiveness in the 
market.
The 
Company 
heavily 
relies on its information 
technology 
systems 
for 
various corporate activities, 
including 
processing 
financial 
information, 
managing 
creditor/debtor 
information, 
customer 
communication, 
website 
marketing, 
and 
regular 
business 
operations. 
Regular 
evaluations 
of 
its cyber space and IT 
guidelines are conducted, 
with the implementation of 
appropriate IT frameworks 
to ensure compliance. 
Negative 
implications 
may be incurred due to 
increased costs arising out 
of risk of obsolescence if 
the company fails to adapt 
to emerging technologies.
