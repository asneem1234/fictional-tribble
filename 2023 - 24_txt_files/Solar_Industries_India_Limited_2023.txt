Solar Industries India Limited
“Solar” House 14,

Nagpur 440023
Subject: Independent Reasonable Assurance Report 
on KPIs/Metrics in the Business Responsibility and 
Sustainability Report (BRSR) of Solar Industries India 
Limited (hereafter referred to as “Solar” or “Company”) 
for the Financial Year ended  on March 31, 2024
1.	 Introduction and Scope
	
Moore Singhi Advisors LLP (“Moore Singhi” or “we” 
or “us”) has been engaged by Solar Industries India 
Limited to provide independent reasonable assurance 
on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) / metrics under 
nine (9) ESG attributes (listed in Annexure 1) that form 
part of Business Responsibility and Sustainability 
Report (“BRSR Core”) issued under SEBI Circular: 
SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD-SEC-2/P/CIR/2023/122 - “BRSR 
Core – Framework for assurance and ESG disclosures 
for value chain” issued on July 12, 2023 (“Circular”), 
and under the terms of the engagement letter dated 
April 20, 2024. 
	
Our assurance on disclosures is for the period starting 
from April 1, 2023, to March 31, 2024. We have not 
performed any procedures for the earlier periods or 
any other elements included in the BRSR report, and 
therefore do not express any opinion thereon.
	
The reporting boundary for the BRSR disclosures 
includes Solar’s operations of 15 manufacturing 
locations at Chakdoh, Chandrapur, Waidhan 2, 
Jharsuguda, Ramgarh, Korba.
	
Ramagundam, 
Pallewada, 
Dhanbad, 
Asansol, 
Bhilwara, Barbil, Manendragarh, Talcher, Bailadila, 
and Corporate Office. An on-site verification was 
conducted at the Nagpur Office, Chakdoh plant and 
Chandrapur plant.
2.	 Solar’s responsibility
	
Solar is responsible for the selection of the reporting 
criteria, 
reporting 
period, 
reporting 
boundary, 
preparation, and disclosure of BRSR information 
and the BRSR Core KPIs / metrics under the nine 
attributes as per “Annexure I – Format of BRSR Core” 
of the aforesaid Circular. This responsibility includes 
stakeholder engagement; design, implementation, 
and maintenance of internal control, including policies 
and processes; maintenance of adequate records; 
calculations; making estimates that are reasonable 
in the circumstances; and ensuring that they are 
free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error. Moore Singhi was not involved in the 
preparation of the BRSR report, BRSR Core KPIs and/
or related backup data. 
3.	 Moore Singhi’s responsibilities
	
Our responsibility is to provide reasonable assurance 
on the BRSR Core KPIs based on the procedures we 
have performed and the evidence we have obtained 
from the Company. We do not accept or assume any 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other 
person or organization.
	
We have considered quantitative materiality and 
qualitative factors in; (i) planning the scope of our 
work and evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) 
evaluating the effect of any identified misstatements 
in the BRSR Core.
	
We 
conducted 
our 
assurance 
engagement 
in 
accordance with the International Standard on 
Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): 
Assurance 
Engagements 
other 
than 
Audits 
or 
Reviews of Historical Financial Information, and the 
International Standard on Assurance Engagements 
(ISAE) 3410: Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse 
Gas Statements, as well as the terms of reference 
for this engagement as agreed with Solar in the 
engagement letter dated April 20, 2024.
	
Those standards require that we plan and perform our 
engagement to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether, in all material respects, the KPIs presented 
to us are prepared in accordance with the reporting 
criteria chosen by the Company as per the Circular.
	
A 
reasonable 
assurance 
engagement 
includes 
performing procedures to obtain sufficient and 
appropriate evidence assessing the risk of material 
misstatement 
of 
the 
KPIs 
disclosed 
in 
BRSR 
Core. In this connection, we have performed the 
following procedures:
	
1.	
Evaluated the suitability of the quantification 
methods used for the BRSR Core KPIs.
	
2.	
Engaged in discussions with the personnel at 
both corporate and facilities responsible for the 
information presented in the report.
	
3.	
On a test basis, verified the data collected, 
recorded, and aggregated to ensure the veracity 
of the reporting.

on which KPI reporting is based.
4.	 Inherent Limitations
	
The reliability of assurance on non-financial information 
is subject to uncertainties inherent in the assurance 
process. The lack of a significant universal body of 
established practice for measuring and evaluating 
non-financial information allows for different, but 
acceptable, measures and measurement techniques, 
potentially affecting comparability between entities. 
Specifically, the uncertainties in greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions estimation arise due to incomplete 
scientific knowledge, limitations in quantification 
models, assumptions, or conversion factors used to 
arrive at results. Due to these inherent limitations, 
there are possibilities that material misstatements in 
the sustainability information of the BRSR Core KPIs in 
the Report may remain undetected.
5.	 Opinion
	
Based on our procedures performed and evidences 
obtained as mentioned in the section 3, information and 
explanations given and management representations 
provided to us, we are of the opinion that the BRSR 
Core KPIs mentioned in Annexure – 1 of our report, are 
prepared in accordance with the criteria chosen by the 
Company based on the requirements of the Circular. 
6.	 Restriction on Use 
	
Our work was performed solely to assist management 
in meeting their responsibilities in relation to Solar’s 
assurance requirements as per the Circular. The report 
is addressed and provided to the Board of Directors 
of the Company, solely for the purpose of enabling it 
to comply with the aforementioned requirements of 
the Circular, and should not be used, referred to or 
distributed for any other purpose or to any other party 
without our prior written consent. Accordingly, we do 
not accept or assume any liability or duty of care for 
any other purpose for which or to any other person to 
whom this assurance report is shown or into whose 
hands it may come without our prior consent in writing. 
	
Other than as described in paragraph 1, which sets out 
the scope of our engagement, we did not perform any 
assurance procedures on the remaining information. 
Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on 
that information.
