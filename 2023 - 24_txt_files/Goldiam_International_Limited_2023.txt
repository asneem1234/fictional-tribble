In the jewellery industry, it
is crucial for companies to
find a delicate equilibrium
between providing
affordable options and
upholding the perceived
value of their products and
services. Additionally, they
must consider the enduring
consequences of their
pricing strategy and refrain
from engaging in a race to
the bottom.
By prioritizing business
ethics, our Company shall
build trust, attract new
customers, enhance its
brand image, and increase
its credibility with customers
and stakeholders. Ethical
practices shall have a
positive impact on
employee engagement.
Our Company has
implemented measures to
minimize potential risks by
expanding their reach
through the online
platforms, capitalizing on
economies of scale, and
adopting a strategic
approach to material
procurement to curtail costs
and provide affordable
options for their customers.
-
Negative – There is a
potential risk of impacting
sales as the balance
between affordability and
maintaining profit margins.
Positive - Increased
customer loyalty translates
into higher sales, improved
customer retention, and
ultimately, better financial
performance.
