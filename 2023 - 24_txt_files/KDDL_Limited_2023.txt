usage, 
companies can reduce their environmental 
footprint, comply with regulations, improve 
operational efficiency, minimize costs, and 
demonstrate a commitment to sustainability. 
Proactive management of emissions and energy 
contributes to a greener and more responsible 
manufacturing industry.
Implement policies and procedures 
to monitor energy and emission 
performance, identifying critical 
areas for improvement. Promote 
the use of renewable energy 
resources, such as solar and 
wind, to reduce and offset GHG 
emissions. Implement emission 
monitoring systems to track key 
high emission factors.
Negative
2.
Water 
Management
R
Water 
management 
is 
essential 
for 
manufacturers to ensure responsible use 
of water resources, reduce environmental 
impact, and mitigate operational risks. Efficient 
water management practices conserve water, 
minimize water-related costs, comply with 
regulations, protect ecosystems, and enhance 
sustainability, 
demonstrating 
corporate 
responsibility and long-term viability.
KDDL will maintain measures for 
effective water management to 
reduce freshwater consumption. 
Effluent treatment plants have 
been installed to treat and 
reuse wastewater for gardening, 
industrial 
applications, 
and 
production processes. Water usage 
assessments and monitoring will 
be conducted to track high usage 
and identify reduction methods. 
Currently, Zero Liquid Discharge 
(ZLD) has been implemented in 
three plants of KDDL.
Negative
3.
Waste 
Management
R
Effective waste management is crucial for 
a manufacturing company as it minimizes 
environmental impact, ensures regulatory 
compliance, 
reduces 
operational 
costs, 
and enhances sustainability. Proper waste 
management practices promote resource 
efficiency, mitigate potential health and 
environmental risks, and demonstrate corporate 
responsibility.
Ensure procedures and policies 
are in place for handling, storing, 
and disposing of waste. KDDL 
responsibly 
manages 
waste 
through 
appropriate 
storage 
and safe disposal via third-party 
vendors. Additionally, implement 
efficient methods to reuse or 
reduce waste, leading to lower 
consumption 
of 
fresh 
raw 
materials.
Negative
4.
Training 
and skill 
improvement

market presence and continued success in a 
competitive industry.

long-term 
sustainable 
growth. 
KDDL ensures product quality, 
continuous development of new

and 
demands. 
Effective

place to receive and incorporate 
customer feedback to enhance 
product quality offerings.
Negative
6.
Occupational
Health and 
Safety
R
Occupational health and safety are critical 
for a manufacturing company as they protect 
employees from workplace hazards, reduce 
the risk of accidents and injuries, improve 
productivity, and ensure legal compliance. 
Prioritizing health and safety foster a positive 
work 
environment 
and 
safeguards 
the 
company’s reputation.
Establish 
clear 
policies 
and 
procedures

hazards at KDDL premises, and 
implement 
effective 
measures 
to mitigate any risks. KDDL

Management 
and resource 
efficiency
O
Innovation enhances product and service 
offerings to better align with customer needs, 
thereby boosting customer satisfaction. It 
also fosters the development of new products 
and services, creating additional revenue 
opportunities for the company. Companies 
that prioritize innovation gain a competitive 
advantage and increase their market share. 
Operational efficiency focuses on achieving 
more with fewer resources, such as reducing 
energy consumption, increasing yield, and 
optimizing equipment utilization, ultimately 
maximizing overall effectiveness.

enable the resolution of all types of grievances received. By adopting the 
aforementioned redressal mechanisms, we aim to address concerns more 
efficiently and effectively. Multiple communication channels ensure that
