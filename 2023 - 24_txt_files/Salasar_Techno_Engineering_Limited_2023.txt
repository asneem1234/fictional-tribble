Statement by director 
responsible for the business 
responsibility report, 
highlighting ESG related 
challenges, targets and 
achievements (listed entity 
has flexibility regarding the 
placement of this disclosure) 
At Salasar Techno Engineering, we are in a critical phase of embracing sustainability. Integrating 
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles into our core operations is essential for 
sustainable growth and long-term value creation. We face challenges in enhancing environmental 
management, addressing social issues, and strengthening governance structures to meet evolving 
regulatory expectations. 
Our ambitious targets include reducing Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 10% by 2030 (against 
a 2023 base year), obtaining Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) certification for all plants by 2029, 
and implementing sustainable sourcing practices by 2028. 
We have made significant progress: our GHG emissions reduction efforts are underway, we 
conducted a stakeholder engagement exercise in 2023-25, and we are planning to implement ISO 
20400 for sustainable procurement. Additionally, we achieved ZLD in one plant. Continuous 
improvement drives our approach to sustainability. We are committed to regular reviews and 
refinements, focusing on innovation, collaboration, and proactive engagement to achieve our 
targets, fostering a sustainable and inclusive future for Salasar Techno Engineering and its 
stakeholders.

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your 
company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to 
manage such wastes.  
Salasar has implemented comprehensive waste management practices to ensure the responsible handling of all waste generated at 
their manufacturing plants. Waste is meticulously segregated and collected on-site. Effluents are treated through Effluent Treatment 
Plants (ETPs), and the resulting sludge is disposed of at authorized Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facilities (TSDFs). E-waste 
is managed by approved and authorized recyclers to ensure safe disposal. Additionally, metallic waste, such as structural steel, 
mild steel, stainless steel and zinc ash, is sold to recyclers. 
To reduce the usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in their products and processes, Salasar Techno Engineering Ltd. has adopted 
a strategic approach focused on process optimization and the substitution of hazardous substances with safer alternatives. 
Continuous monitoring and improvement of their processes ensure minimal environmental impact and promote sustainability in 
their operations.

Describe the mechanisms to receive and redress grievances of the community 
Salasar has established an External Grievance Redressal Policy to address the concerns and grievances of our external stakeholders,

investigations and strives to resolve issues through dialogue, mediation, or other suitable means. All grievances are treated with 
confidentiality, and the process is documented meticulously.
