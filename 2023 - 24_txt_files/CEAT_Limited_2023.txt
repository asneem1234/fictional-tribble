Chairman’s Message 
Dear Shareholders,
Fiscal year 2024 witnessed a healthy 
domestic 
resilience 
in 
the 
backdrop 
of continued global uncertainties. The 
global economy remained turbulent due 
to ongoing geopolitical conflicts. While 
inflation pressures started subsiding, supply 
chain challenges have continued particularly 
in certain sectors. All major economies 
experienced a slowed down with  some of 
them even slipping  into recession. However, 
India has continued to march ahead driven 
by a strong domestic economy, stable 
political situation, timely interventions 
to tame inflation, and the government’s 
strategic focus on strengthening physical 
and digital infrastructure along with a push 
for ‘Make in India’. 
For the Indian tyre industry, input costs 
moderated in the first half of the year 
and have remained stable thereafter. 
Domestic demand remained encouraging 
throughout the year. CEAT's steadfast 
commitment towards its key growth pillars 
led to commendable growth across all 
product segments and markets as well 
as a notable recovery in profitability. Our 
strategic expansion in Europe and Americas, 
particularly in the Off-Highway business, 
promises growth prospects going forward.
I am delighted to announce that CEAT's 
unwavering dedication to quality and 
process efficiency has once again garnered 
global recognition. We have recently been 
awarded the prestigious Deming Grand 
Prize, making CEAT the only tyre Company 
globally to achieve this remarkable feat. This 
accomplishment stands as a testament to 
our ethos of customer-centricity, world-class 
practices, and cutting-edge facilities, all of 
which are pivotal in our pursuit of excellence.
We remain committed to reduce our carbon 
footprint by 50% by 2030 and have made 
significant progress towards this goal 
during the year. We have also intensified our 
efforts on water conservation, renewable 
energy, sustainable sourcing and creating 
a workplace for the future characterised by 
agility, innovation and inclusivity.
Thank you for your unwavering support in 
our journey towards making mobility safer 
and smarter, every day. We hope for your 
continued patronage as we lead CEAT into 
the next era of growth.
H.V. Goenka
Chairman

Vice-Chairman’s Message
For last 100 years, CEAT has 
been at the forefront of the tyre 
industry, shaping mobility and 
safety across the globe. As CEAT 
celebrate its centenary, it stands 
tall as a testament to resilience, 
innovation, and commitment 
towards serving its customers
Dear Shareholders,
Global Scenario
The world continues to face geopolitical 
uncertainties with the prolonged Russia-
Ukraine conflict, and the ongoing Israel-
Hamas war. These events have cast 
a shadow over the global economic 
landscape, leading to volatility in markets 
and concerns over energy security and 
supply chains. Despite these challenges, 
India is a beacon of stability and growth, 
with its GDP expected to grow by 7%+ 
in fiscal year 2025. This robust economic 
outlook, positions India as a key player in 
the global arena, ready to capitalise on 
emerging opportunities.
CEAT: A Century of Excellence
CEAT turns 100 in 2024! From a humble 
beginning in Turin, Italy in 1924 to 
establishing itself as major player in India 
to become a global brand with presence 
across 110+ countries, CEAT has stood the 
test of time and changing global landscape.
CEAT has been at the forefront of the tyre 
industry for several years, shaping mobility 
and safety across the globe. As CEAT 
celebrate its centenary, it stands tall as a 
testament to resilience, innovation and 
commitment towards serving its customers.
Coinciding with its 100-year milestone, 
CEAT has also achieved the Deming Grand 
Prize in the fiscal year, making it the first 
tyre Company globally to do so. This 
award reflects CEAT’s pursuit of excellence, 
commitment 
to 
the 
Total 
Quality 
Management (TQM) philosophy & efforts 
towards delighting customers.
CEAT’s Performance
CEAT 
has 
demonstrated 
remarkable 
resilience and agility amidst a turbulent 
environment characterised by raw material 
fluctuations, subdued demand in developed 
economies, and persistent supply chain 
disruptions. 
Our 
strategic 
initiatives 
have enabled us to not only weather 
these storms but also to thrive. CEAT has 
successfully increased its market share in all 
major categories including two wheelers, 
passenger and commercial vehicles.
With the higher focus on branding, 
manufacturing excellence and use of 
technology, our margins saw significant 
increase over last year.
Global Presence
Contributing to the “India for the World” 
shift, CEAT continues to make strides in 
exports with double digit growth. CEAT 
has entered twelve new geographies in 
the fiscal year with plan to enter the world 
largest tyre market, the US in 2025. This 
expansion underscores our capability to 
produce best in class products to meet 
global requirements.
The entry into each country is done post 
gathering deep customer insights, country 
specific product development and a strong 
Go to Market (GTM) strategy through a 
high-quality distribution network. 
Branding
CEAT is embarking on a fresh chapter in its 
brand story with the introduction of its new 
brand ethos, “Crafted for the Curious”. This 
ethos resonates with a growing segment 
of consumers who prioritise exploration, 
discovery, and the thrill of the journey 
over mere transportation. This customer 
segment is more experience driven and has 
dramatic influence on other buyers.
The launch of ‘CEAT Trails’, with the first 
expedition from Mumbai to Siberia on 
CEAT CrossDrive and CEAT WinterDrive 
tyres marks the creation of a new premium 
property for CEAT.
In its pursuit of distinction & premium 
positioning, CEAT continues to prioritise 
partnerships 
with 
premium 
OEMs, 
launching premium products and strives 
to sustain its influential presence in the 
electric vehicle domain, which has recently 
witnessed surge of new entrants.
Technology and Digital Innovation
Leveraging the success of the Halol 
Lighthouse recognition for its Industry 
4.0 adoption, CEAT is expanding its digital 
footprint across various manufacturing 
sites and throughout its value chain. By 
embracing digital technologies such as 
artificial intelligence and machine learning, 
CEAT has achieved significant reductions 
in cycle times, batch variations, new 
product development (NPD) timelines and 
enhanced scheduling efficiencies in its 
manufacturing facilities.
In the realm of R&D, CEAT stands out among 
its Indian counterparts in patent filings. 
CEAT has filed total of 171 patents till date 
and 46 of them are already granted. CEAT 
is committed to increase the proportion of 
green materials in its products year on year 
while ensuring that product performance 
and 
manufacturing 
efficiency 
remain 
uncompromised. The percentage of green 
materials utilised in the fiscal year 2024 has 
increased to 28.4% from 27.2% last year. 
Sustainability Initiatives
Sustainability 
is 
woven 
into 
CEAT’s 
operational fabric. It is actively pursuing 
its ambitious goal to reduce its carbon 
footprint by 50% by 2030. To realise its 
sustainability vision, CEAT has identified five 
key areas for carbon emission reduction: 
raw material procurement, manufacturing 
processes, outbound logistics, product 
usage, and end-of-life tyre disposal. CEAT is 
making progress across all fronts. Notably, 
CEAT’s emission intensity has reduced by 
over 7%, and the use of renewable energy 
has climbed to 36%, a significant increase 
from 30% in the previous year.
Conclusion
In these times of adversity, CEAT’s resolve 
to deliver value to shareholders, customers, 
and 
communities 
remains 
unshaken. 
With continuous improvements across all 
metrics, CEAT is well-positioned to capitalise 
on 
the 
forthcoming 
opportunities, 
propelled by our strategic foresight and 
relentless pursuit of excellence. Here’s to 
forging ahead into CEAT’s next century of 
innovation and success!

Materiality Assessment
Materiality Assessment Process
CEAT conducted its inaugural comprehensive materiality assessment during the fiscal year 
2019-20. The Company continues to perform regular assessments across key domains such 
as the economy, environment, community, supply chain, governance, people, and human 
rights. The insights obtained from these assessments play a pivotal role in shaping CEAT’s 
business strategy, strategic objectives and long-term plans. Identified as critical areas, these 
material topics allow CEAT to identify Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) risks 
and opportunities, thus reinforcing its sustainability efforts. CEAT’s materiality assessment 
aligns with the standards established by the Global Reporting Initiatives (GRI) and SEBI’s 
National Guidelines on Responsible Business Conduct (NGRBC). The Company conducts its 
materiality assessment periodically. In addition to this, the Company is exploring Double 
Materiality Assessment to assess Financial Materiality and Impact Materiality for fiscal 
year 2024-25.
The Company has identified risks and opportunities linked to these material topics, and it 
discloses mitigation measures for identified risks in Section A of the Business Responsibility 
and Sustainability Report (BRSR) and Risk Management Section of Management Discussion

Electrification
In FY 2023-24, CEAT has focused on the four 
megatrends of Electrification, Premiumisation, 
Digitisation and Internationalisation. For 
electrification, the Company is expanding 
its 
research 
and 
development 
and 
manufacturing capacities to cater to the 
demand of tyres for electric vehicles. The 
Company is actively working to support the 
EV landscape by producing the right kind of 
tyres for all the segments specially 2-Wheeler, 
3-Wheeler, Truck and Bus Radials (TBR), etc. 
Considering the fact that EV tyres demand 
the need for heavier batteries to withstand 
initial torque, the pattern and grip has to be 
stronger since the battery is heavy. EV’s are 
generally very silent vehicles.  The Company 
has successfully positioned itself in India’s 
ambitious e-mobility drive.
In the two-wheeler EV category, the 
Company has witnessed the demand for EV 
tyres from a number of reputed brands. The 
Company is agile to cater the expectations 
and needs of OEMs.

Enhancement of customer orientation 
level based on QBM approach:
In order to improve the customer experience, 
all manufacturing process are strengthened 
through digitalisation and increasing the 
quality of problem-solving process through 
Managers QIP’s. As a result, customer 
orientation level is increased through value 
chain and adding new OEM customers into 
the account. In addition, Cross Functional 
Management, Policy management, Daily 
work management are working together 
to improve the Key Performance indicators.
Lean Initiatives for enhancing Efficiency 
and Value:
Value Stream Mapping (VSM) is a visual tool 
used to analyse the flow of materials and 
information required to bring a product 
or service to the customer. By mapping 
the current state and designing a future 
state with reduced waste (MUDA), we 
identified key areas for improvement in 
OEE, TAKT Rate, Cycle time and CT/TT ratio. 
VSM helped in pinpointing bottlenecks, 
redundancies, and non-value-adding

to reduce product lead time significantly.
MURI Reduction- in lean manufacturing, 
reducing MURI is crucial to achieving 
optimal efficiency and productivity. MURI 
occurs when resources are pushed beyond 
their limits, leading to fatigue, breakdowns, 
and inefficiencies. It can manifest in various 
forms, including physical overburden and 
mental overburden. MURI is identified 
through VSM/Process direct observations. 
MURI reduction improvements are identified 
through Ergonomic study, developing easy 
to follow SOP, and low cost automation.
Kaizen & SPARSH Circles- Employees at 
all levels were encouraged to regularly 
suggest and implement small, incremental 
changes to processes. Kaizen events, or 
focused 
improvement 
projects, 
were 
organised to address specific problems 
or areas of inefficiency. This culture of 
ongoing improvement helped us stay agile 
and responsive to changes.
Assurance of Zero Mistakes – In order 
to achieve zero mistakes, error proofing 
initiatives are taken through Poka -Yoke 
approach 
including 
physical 
devices, 
automated controls and human error 
prevention projects based on five human 
error principles. All error proofing devices

CEAT is creating a shared value for the communities from Northeast India by procuring 
natural rubber from marginalised communities and in its endeavour to ensure better quality 
of the produce and corresponding enhancement, the Company has significantly increased 
the natural rubber procurement from 4.1% in FY 2019-20 to 23% in FY 2023-24.

areas. The north-eastern states fall under the non-traditional area and constitute about 25% 
of the total rubber-growing area in the country. In the major rubber-growing districts of the 
northeast, around 85% of operational holdings belong to marginal farmers who possess 
less than 1 hectare of land, with around 35% belonging to indigenous communities.
The Company has conducted 10 workshops for required skills and knowledge to these 
communities.

Fever Clinics
A comprehensive network of 33 clinics 
has been set up throughout rural and 
urban Maharashtra under the Fever Clinic 
initiative, with the goal of delivering 
healthcare services to the public. This 
initiative represents a collaborative 
endeavor between the National Health 
Mission and local authorities to bolster 
medical 
infrastructure. 
Throughout 
the COVID-19 pandemic, these clinics 
served a vital function in conducting 
tests and offering medical care to 
individuals exhibiting symptoms like 
fever. With the pandemic situation 
showing 
signs 
of 
improvement, 
these clinics have adapted to provide 
alternative 
healthcare 
services

address the changing requirements of 
the community.
CEAT’s CSR team has innovatively adapted Cart 
classrooms, providing a fully digitised learning 
environment, by successfully digitising its 
‘Pehlay Akshar’ programme. Ensuring that 
both teachers and students are trained to use 
the digital infrastructure effectively. With this 
initiative, it has addressed the issue of space 
constraints faced by BMC schools.
The focus of the Pehlay Akshar Teacher 
Training programme is to improve English 
learning outcomes in BMC schools by 
strengthening the professional ability 
of government schoolteachers in both 
classroom management and the English 
language. There are two parts to the 
programme, which include training Star 
teachers, leading Saathi sessions, and 
evaluating student and teacher progress. 
The CSR programme of CEAT centers on 
‘Functional English’ at BMC Schools, where 
Magic Classrooms are being replaced 
with Learning Rooms. This effort is part 
of a broader drive to transform teaching 
and 
learning 
strategies 
across 
India 
through well-researched programs and 
collaborations with state governments.

Mrs.Varalakshmi Guna & Mrs.Nathiya, displaying their products for sale on 
Women’s Day at CEAT
Mrs. Varalakshmi, is a homemaker with two sons who are in 6th and 9th grade, is self-
motivated and passionate about designing blouses, bangles, and earrings. “I am 
interested in stitching and designing blouses. Previously, after completing my domestic 
chores, I used to sleep in the afternoon. Currently, I am spending my time learning Aari 
embroidery and exploring new designs on Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, etc. It’s a 
self-discovery journey for me being in Aari training. I am eager to learn more, create 
new designs, and expand our Aari business. Though it’s just the beginning, I hope to 
travel a long way with the team.”
The work was excellent; the women 
quickly learned to make these new 
types of bags. Although it was initially 
challenging for them, they swiftly 
adapted and completed the work 
proficiently. Given that women from the 
community face limitations in terms of 
going out for work, or even going out at 
all, if we receive similar work that can be 
done from home, we will greatly prefer 
it. We tried to do a good job with the 
bag as much as we could. We would be 
interested in doing a similar project in 
the future if there are any. Lastly, I would 
like to express our gratitude to CEAT and 
Renovate India for providing us with this

Hundred Years of CEAT
Cavi Elettrici e Affini Torino, the Company which was founded by Virginio Bruni Tedeschi in 1924, 
initially, produced electrical and telephone cables. At the onset of World War II, it entered into the 
rubber industry, producing gas masks. Near the end of the war, in 1945, it started producing tyres. 
In 1958, CEAT Tyres of India was founded as a collaboration between the Tedeshchi family and 
the Tatas. In the same year, the first plant in India was commissioned at Mumbai and a couple of 
years later, first tyre produced in India rolled out of the factory. RPG group acquired CEAT Tyres of 
India in 1981. In the 80s and 90s CEAT was involved in other businesses as well such as glass fibre, 
electronics, and tyre cords. The Company also partnered with global tyre majors like Yokohama and 
Goodyear. In 1992, the Company entered Sri Lanka through a joint venture and today is the market 
leader in the country. 
CEAT, the 100-year-old brand is synonymous with safety. The Company’s purpose statement itself is ‘Making Mobility Safer & Smarter. Every 
Day.’ Safety also includes a safer planet, and the Company aims to halve its carbon footprint by 2030.
During the reporting year, the Company has been awarded the Deming Grand Prize which is considered to be one of the highest achievements 
in TQM (Total Quality Management) worldwide. In doing so, it has become the first tyre Company in India and one of only 33 companies 
globally to receive the prestigious award. Previously, CEAT was the first tyre Company outside of Japan to win the Deming Prize in 2017. The 
Company received Lighthouse recognition from the World Economic Forum (WEF) for adoption of ‘Industry 4.0’ technologies for its Halol 
facility in the previous reporting period and is developing capabilities to have further lighthouse recognitions across all the facilities. 
The Company is passionate about offering value and safety to its 
customers. It’s extensive geographical presence, combined with 
innovative products, has enabled it to maintain a strong competitive 
position in the market. 
Global Economy  
For most part of 2023, the global growth was weighed by a host 
of factors, including ongoing geo-political tensions, the Red Sea 
crisis, adverse weather conditions and tight financial conditions. 
The global economy has been resilient despite these challenges. 
The global GDP growth rate was 3.2% in CY 23. According to IMF 
predictions, global economic growth would stay at 3.2% CY 24 as 
well as CY 25. The Central Banks globally have kept the rates elevated 
in order to fight inflation. The global headline inflation is expected 
to moderate to 5.9% in CY 24 and further reduce to 4.5% in CY 25. 
Source: IMF, World Economic Outlook
The United States Federal Reserve is focused on achieving price 
stability, generating maximum employment and targeting moderate 
log-term interest rates. The unemployment has remained low and 
the inflation has eased over the past years but remains elevated. The 
Federal Open Market Committee (‘FOMC’) targets the federal funds 
rate around 5.25–5.5%. The US economy grew at 2.5% in CY 23 and is 
projected to grow to 2.7% in CY 24 and slow down to 1.9% in CY 25 
as per the estimates and projections released by IMF. The increasing 
geo-political and geo-economic tensions between US and China 
may lead to potential supply chain disruptions across countries. 
The Company has presence in the United States market in the Agri-
Radial category and plans to launch the PCUV and TBR tyres of FY 25 
and is building capabilities to cater to the market as the world looks 
for alternatives for sourcing tyres.

The countries in the Sub-Saharan Africa continue to face a sluggish 
growth, higher inflation, high borrowing costs and a cost-of-living 
crisis. In many countries, the double-digit rate of inflation persists, 
borrowing costs remain elevated and political instability remains a 
concern. The IMF predicts, the Sub-Saharan African region to grow 
at ‘3.8%’ in CY 24 and ‘4%’ in CY 25. 2023 has been a difficult year 
for the countries in this region however, they may expect a rebound 
owing to growth in non-resource intensive countries. 
Source: IMF: Regional Economic Outlook: Sub-Saharan Africa
The LATAM region has seen a growth of 2.3% in CY 23. The growth in 
this region has softened due to the weakening external environment 
and tighter policies to combat inflation. The region has witnessed 
monetary tightening since 2021. Further withdrawal of fiscal 
stimulus and the reversal of external price pressures have resulted in 
a downward trajectory in inflation. The growth in the LATAM region 
is expected to slow down to 2% in CY 24 and rise to 2.5% in CY 25. 
Source: IMF: Regional Economic Outlook – LATAM 
The European economy entered 2024 on a weaker footing than 
expected.  The economy avoided a technical recession in the second 
half of CY 23 and the economic prospects for CY 24 have improved. 
The energy prices have remained moderate and despite the mild 
upward pressure from the higher shipping costs due to the trade 
disruption in Red Sea, the underlying inflation has continued on a 
steady downward path. According to IMF predictions, Europe grew 
at 0.4% in CY 23 and is predicted to grow by 0.8% in CY 24 before 
accelerating 1.5% in CY 25.

Indian Economy  
Despite the significant global headwinds, the Indian economy 
has been resilient and remained one of the fastest growing major 
economy in FY 24. The domestic economy was healthy due to 
positive consumer sentiments and robust investment demand. In 
the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting held in April 2024, 
the RBI kept the Repo Rate unchanged at 6.5% for the 7th consecutive 
time. The headline inflation eased out from its peak in the month of 
December to 5.1% in January and February 2024. The cumulative 
growth rate in Index of Industrial Production (IIP) for manufacturing 
in FY 24 stood at 5.5% as compared to 4.7% in FY 23.

Indian Tyre Industry  
As international markets press for stricter environmental 
regulations, the Indian tyre sector will witness transition to more 
non-carbon/greener materials for tyres. Investments in research and 
development by the tyre Companies are being deployed to cater 
to this requirement. The industry is also focusing on creating the 
ability of tyres to capture data and transmit it on a real-time basis. 
The global search for alternatives to Chinese manufacturers has led 
to a rise in the contributions made by the Indian tyre sector. The US 
is the largest market for Indian tyres accounting for nearly 25% of 
the total tyre exports from India.

all around the world. The car manufacturers have pledged to phase 
out the internal combustion engine as early as 2035.
Sustainability in the tyre industry 
The automotive component sector including tyre sector is at 
the forefront of introducing the best sustainability practices by 
highlighting its commitment towards mitigation of emerging risks 
due to the climate change and supply chain disruptions. The leading 
sector companies are adopting a roadmap with commitment to 
emission reduction, water stewardship and circular economy with a 
focus on evolving regulatory landscape. 
The tyre industry is focusing on various sustainability aspects across the key 
stages of the product lifecycle from raw material sourcing, manufacturing 
to the end-of-life management of tyres. The industry is also focusing 
on low-rolling resistance with enhanced fuel efficiency and low-noise 
tyres. Customer centricity and safety is at the core of the sustainability 
strategy in the industry. The industry is upskilling its workforce to cater to 
the needs of evolving customer expectations and changing regulations 
across the globe. In addition, the tyre-industry is reducing its waste by

Raw material trends
Rubber    
The Natural Rubber (NR) prices continue to rise owing to shortage 
of supplies, increased demand and delayed imports. The Red 
Sea crisis also impacted the import of both Synthetic and Natural 
Rubber which has led to a marginal increase in the freight rates. 
India has been importing over 5 lakh tonnes annually over the 
past few years to meet the demand in the Indian Market. The NR 
production in India was 8.5 lakhs tonnes which increased over the 
reporting year. The consumption of Natural Rubber has increased by 
about 6% to 9 lakh tonnes  during the same period.  The escalation 
in the prices of Natural Rubber is expected to continue globally 
in the short term. As of December 2023, Thailand and Indonesia 
were the largest producers of Natural Rubber. There are no new 
capacities added for Synthetic Rubber whereas the consumption 
has increased by about 5%.
Carbon Black and Silica 
As sustainability becomes the key focus area within the tyre industry, 
it is witnessing a shift from the use of carbon black towards recovered 
carbon black and silica which are sustainable raw materials used in 
the tyre production process. 
Business Review 
CEAT ended FY 24 on a positive note and witnessed recovery 
in volumes in the second half of the year in replacement and 
international markets with significant improvement in the margins 
on full year basis. The growth was largely attributable to share gain 
in passenger categories both in 2-Wheeler and 4-Wheeler segment 
and substantial expansion in export markets.

International Business
CEAT continues to be one of the major tyre exporters with a 
footprint across 110+ countries. In FY 24, export sales have grown 
considerably across the segments and geographies despite 
subdued demand due to continued inflation in Europe, currency 
volatility and geopolitical conflicts. 
CEAT witnessed an increase in demand and recorded an increase in 
sales in Middle East, Brazil, Latin American, South-East Asian markets 
and European countries. The demand has come back to normalcy in 
SAARC countries and the Company not only gained lost volume but, 
also increased its share of business.  
The Company continued its focus on catering to the PCR demand 
in Europe. The  quality and performance has been endorsed by 
customers globally and the Company is inching towards gaining 
momentum. The Company’s all season tyres ranked 14th amongst 
global players in the independent test carried out by Auto Bild, a 
German Magazine on various performance metrics. This is a true 
reflection of CEAT’s commitment and determination to provide 
high quality tyres to its customers globally. 
The Company has developed product capabilities and deployed 
manpower to cater to the US market and is already catering to the 
market with the launch of the Agri-Radial category. CEAT plans 
to further cater to the PCUV and TBR segments in the US market. 
CEAT is well-poised to continue its growth in the international 
business in FY 25.

Quality Assurance System   
Quality Assurance (QA) at CEAT spans the entire value chain, 
ensuring excellence from raw material procurement to customer 
satisfaction, leveraging digital tools to meet diverse customer needs 
efficiently. The QA’s function is to strengthen the assurance system 
and process to ensure heightened customer service by meeting 
their stated and unstated requirements. The management is made 
aware of the critical quality indicators across the business units and 
functions, by the QA function. 
The cross-functional Quality Council takes in a horizontal view of 
critical customer requirements and ensures maintenance of quality 
for customers in the following ways: 
1)	
To have an outside-in view of the stated and unstated 
customer needs and provide strategic direction to proactively 
develop products and services. 
2)	
To review the adequacy of systems and processes related to 
critical and major customer complaints and further enhance its 
efficiency for early detection and prevention of causal factors 
along with facilitating horizontal deployment of solutions.  
3)	
To ensure functional alignment across the organisation 
with an intent to achieve the stated objectives of CEAT 
Quality Assurance. 
CEAT’s QA employs rigorous measures like zero-defect workstations, 
Statistical Process Control (SPC), and Critical-to-Quality (CTQ) audits, 
ensuring high-quality standards. It also facilitates engagements with 
OEMs. The QA function prepares the organisation for OEM audits 
and approvals and interactions with all OEM customers pertaining 
to current and future projects.
The quality of a tyre is described in terms of its construction, 
reliability, its suitability for a specific purpose and the degree to 
which it satisfies customers’ needs. Consistent product quality along 
with continued R&D is the key to building and enhancing customer 
experience. To enhance customer experience, CEAT is focusing 
on Product Rating / EU labeling parameters – Rolling Resistance, 
Noise and Wet Grip. CEAT is also one of the first companies to 
comply on meeting all the requirements of the Indian BEE Energy 
Star label ratings.
CEAT values the opinions and suggestions put forth by customers 
and the Company’s channel partners across the business units and 
factors the same into product and service quality improvement. 
Customer touch-points are improved with a unified ‘Voice of the 
Customer’ system to address concerns related to product and 
services. Automatic reports are generated, and phenomena  are 
assigned to relevant process owners and the closure of these are 
tracked at various review forums. The final effectiveness of the QA 
system is measured through an extensive customer satisfaction 
survey, conducted by external agencies.  
In the current market scenario, with ever-changing customer 
expectations and market conditions, emergence of new competitors 
and existing competitors are always evolving to be best-in-class 
for adhering to dynamic and demanding situation. Due to this, 
market superiority may be lost for regularised products over the 
course of time. In the journey of customer centricity, through pro-
active approach, QA team carries out rigorous benchmarking of 
such regularised products (products which exist in the market for 
>2 years), where CEAT products and their respective Key Value 
Propositions (KVPs) such as tyre life, ride and handling ration etc. 
are evaluated and products with inferior performance undergo 
upgradation to re-establish their best-in-class status. In the ongoing 
process, the superior products are promoted accordingly in the 
market for better value proposition to the customers. With a rolling 
multi-year benchmarking roadmap about 2/3rd of the Company’s 
products continue to prove their superiority, while the rest get taken

Risk Management 
The risk management methodology adopted at CEAT begins 
with the stage of risk identification and is followed by a detailed 
assessment of their potential impacts. The assessment is conducted 
by analysing previous trends and future estimates, while also 
accounting for external perspectives to ensure a comprehensive 
coverage of current and emerging risks. Subsequently, appropriate 
measures are developed and implemented to mitigate these risks as 
required. The risks are regularly re-evaluated and monitored, with 
a focus on identifying and addressing emerging risks by including 
them in the risk management plan.
Risk management 
CEAT's risk management approach consists of several key components that work together to ensure that the Company is adequately 
prepared to address and manage potential risks. These components include: 
Risk Management Approach
Risk and their Mitigation
Risks
Mitigation
1.	 Margin Impact due to raw materials Price 
Volatility and inability to increase the prices 
to off-set the RM price increase
	
Profit margins can be impacted by the fluctuation 
of raw material prices, as well as the presence of 
low-cost domestic and international competitors 
who engage in aggressive pricing behaviour. 
Such factors may have an adverse effect on 
profitability.
CEAT is implementing various measures to foster long-term associations 
and improve its margin profile. It is exploring a wider supplier base and 
strengthening relationships with existing suppliers. It’s longstanding 
relationships with OEMs and the quality of its products have contributed to 
brand recognition. To differentiate itself from competitors, CEAT is expanding 
its channels, enhancing after-sales service, and providing superior quality 
products with associated warranties. It is also focused on growing high-margin 
profitable segments, implementing price increases, developing capacity for 
new products, expanding in premium segment as well as new markets. CEAT is 
leveraging its deep domain knowledge, technology prowess, brand recall, and 
reach to stay ahead of competition.
2.	 Cyber Security Risk
CEAT periodically examines the risks of cyber-attacks to its system and takes 
preventive and detective measures to ensure its mitigation. External IT 
consultants are involved to provide inputs for safeguarding systems against 
cyber-attacks. A Business Continuity Plan (BCP) is also developed to ensure 
mitigation against unplanned exigencies.
3.	 ESG Risk
The Company has established a ESG council that regularly examines ESG 
specific risks, plans it’s mitigation and ensures implementation. In terms of 
governance, the Company utilises a web-based compliance tool to monitor 
all the pertinent compliances. Additionally, there are policies in effect that 
addresses various human rights’ needs, diversity and other obligations.
4.	 Geopolitical disruption
	
The emergence of a big risk, due to factors 
such as a debt crisis, war, trust deficit in inter-
state relations, and uncertainty leads to supply 
disruptions and an overall increase in prices.
To mitigate the risk, proactive measures are being taken in the following areas:
1.	 Ensuring supply chain agility
2.	 Maintaining healthy balance sheet ratios
3.	 Developing long-term supply and demand plans
4.	 Expanding into new geographies and OEMs/sizes

mid-single-digit growth in the topline across all three segments – 
replacement, OEMs, and international business. Key focus has been 
on improving the product mix and judicious pricing which has 
helped improve margins during the year. Growth during the year

tyres. The Company has begun to see some recovery in exports and 
the replacement market, especially in the commercial category. The 
Company has managed to bring down the debt sharply throughout 
the financial year. Better sweating of assets, improved efficiencies 
through digital interventions and other measures, have improved

a network of more than 5,500+ dealers, 600+ distributors and over

Deming Grand Prize is an illustrious honour for organisations that 
have achieved the Deming Prize and have continued to sustain and 
elevate their Total Quality Management (TQM) practices for more 
than three years. The Company has been on the TQM journey for 
over fifteen years and was the first tyre company outside Japan to 
win the prestigious Deming Prize in 2017.
With regard to sustainability, the Company had institutionalised  its 
purpose through the organisation-wide adoption of its purpose 
statement in 2015 and has been working consistently towards its 
sustainability goals. Further progress on this front and various 
initiatives being taken under the ambit of Environment, Social

Notes:
(1)	
Median remuneration of the employees is calculated on the basis of remuneration details of employees including the Managing

Directors’ remuneration includes commission and sitting fees for FY 2023-24. While Commission is determined based on the 
contribution and tenure served by Non-executive Directors during the year, the sitting fees are paid based on the number of meetings 
of Board and Committee attended by them respectively. Therefore, variation in the remuneration of the Directors could be attributed 
to the committee positions held and the number of meetings attended by them during the year.
(3)	
Ms. Sukanya Kripalu and Mr. Milind Sarwate were appointed as Additional Director in the capacity of Independent Director w.e.f. March 14, 
2024. Thus, remuneration paid for the year 2023-24 being for the part of the year, the percentage increase / decrease in the remuneration 
is strictly not comparable. 
(4)	
Mr. Vinay Bansal resigned as an Independent Director of the Company w.e.f. June 1, 2023. Thus, remuneration paid for the year 2023-24 
being for the part of the year, the percentage increase / decrease in the remuneration is strictly not comparable. 
(5)	
Mr. Anant Vardhan Goenka was appointed as the Non-executive Non-independent Director designated as Vice-Chairman of the 
Company w.e.f. April 1, 2023 and the Members of the Company approved the said appointment vide an Ordinary Resolution passed 
through Postal Ballot on April 27, 2023. Accordingly, since remuneration paid for the year 2023-24 is in the current capacity, the 
percentage increase / decrease in the remuneration is not comparable.

the Company / business policy and strategy apart from other 
statutory matters as required to be deliberated and approved 
by the Board. The Board / Committee Meetings (‘Meetings’) are 
pre-scheduled and a tentative annual calendar of meetings is 
circulated to the Directors well in advance to facilitate them to 
plan their schedule and to ensure meaningful participation in 
the Meetings. However, in case of a special and urgent business 
need, approval is taken by passing resolution(s) by circulation, 
as permitted by law, which are noted and confirmed in the 
subsequent Meeting.
	
The Management endeavours to provide the Board with 
sufficient information apart from the items as mandated for 
discussion by the Board under Regulation 17(7) read with 
Part A of Schedule II to SEBI Listing Regulations. Through 
various information being placed or presented at the Board 
Meetings, the Board is kept well informed about the overall 
functioning of the Company, which enables the Board to 
contribute to growth of the Company and helps them to take 
informed decisions. Prior approval from the Board is obtained 
for circulating the agenda items with shorter notice for 
matters that form part of the Board and Committee Agenda 
and are considered to be in the nature of Unpublished Price 
Sensitive Information.
	
The Board periodically reviews the updates on projects, 
business performance, risk management, strategies, people, 
processes, ESG related updates and other key affairs of the 
Company having impact on the business. The Board is satisfied 
that plans are in place for orderly succession for appointment 
to the Board and to Senior Management Personnel.
	
The adoption of a digital platform has enabled the Company to 
conduct paperless Meetings, thereby improving governance 
while simplifying the process of conducting such Meetings. 
This involves conducting Meetings efficaciously, with the 
Board being able to access information directly on their digital 
devices. The platform meets high standards of security and 
integrity that are required for storage and transmission of 
Board / Committee agenda and pre-reads in electronic form.
	
The Non-executive Directors including the Independent 
Directors of the Company appreciate quality, quantity and 
timeliness of flow of information between the Management 
and the Board as well as the Board process through the 
feedback being sought from such Directors periodically.
	
The MD & CEO is responsible for day-to-day management of the 
Company, subject to the supervision, direction and control of the 
Board. The MD & CEO is ably assisted by the Executive Committee 
and Operating Committee for implementing the decisions and 
strategic policies of the Board for effective execution.
	
The Board meets at least once in every quarter to review the 
quarterly results and other items on the agenda. Additional 
meetings are held whenever necessary. During the year under

Disclosure of commodity price risks / foreign exchange 
risk and hedging activities
	
Risk Management Policy of the Company with respect to 
Commodities and Forex 
	
Volatility in commodity prices is managed by combining 
a robust price forecast mechanism with a buying model 
comprising of spot buying, forward buying and strategic long- 
term contracts. Inventory levels are maintained in alignment to 
this. Since significant quantum of raw materials are procured 
from international sources, appropriate hedging mechanisms 
are in place to insulate forex fluctuations.
	
The Company manages the volatility in the foreign currency 
prices through hedging mechanisms. The exposure risk 
arises primarily due to the import and export activities of the 
Company as well as short-term and long-term borrowings in 
foreign currency. The Company has put in place a Policy for 
Foreign Exchange and Interest Risk Management which is duly 
approved by the Board of the Company. The Foreign Exchange 
Risk Management programme of the Company is carried 
out as per the said Policy and the Company uses forward 
contracts, derivatives, structured derivatives and swaps as 
hedging instruments. The Company is suitably insulated

Principle 2: 
Businesses should provide goods and services in a manner that is sustainable and safe.
2. 	
a. 	
Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)
	
	
Yes, the Company continues to focus on integrating sustainability at each stage of the product life cycle. This concept is important 
and vital to the Company’s success. The Company emphasises on concepts in designing and manufacturing of tyres enabled with 
digital technology, extended mobility, tyres with longer life, fuel efficient environment friendly tyres which also ensures customer 
safety and comfort. 
	
	
The degree of sustainability is largely determined during the beginning of the life stage of the product lifecycle in which the 
product is designed and developed. Based on the very same principle, the Company has developed its products which are safe for 
environmental and sociological aspects throughout its lifecycle. It has developed several new green resources for various types 
of raw materials that follow international norms and standards like Regulation on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and 
Restriction of Chemicals (‘REACH’), End of Life Vehicles (‘ELV’) and Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (‘CMRT’). 
	
	
The Company has several projects around product stewardship for manufacturing and supply chain. The Company has intelligent 
and low-weight tyres, reduction in rolling resistance for better fuel economy for consumers. The Company’s product complies with 
substance of concerns, label rating of products with the local and global markets.
	
b.	
 If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably? 
	
	
CEAT is a member of ‘Global Platform for Sustainable Natural Rubber’ (GPSNR) w.e.f April 2024. The Company strives to reduce 
material sourcing from deforestation or forest degraded regions to align with 100% EUDR compliance by December 2024. The 
Company is also reducing its carbon footprint through network optimisation by opting for coastal shipment route for 25% of local 
rubber requirements.
	
	
The Company has an effective procedure in place for evaluating vendors. The Company ensures that suppliers comply with all 
legal and regulatory requirements during the supplier onboarding process. For acquiring raw materials, only approved vendors 
are involved. The Company supports its suppliers in establishing quality, health, and safety, and environmental management 
systems. The Company has successfully completed ISO 20400 Sustainable Procurement audit in April 2024. Currently, OHSAS 
18001/ISO 45001 and ISO 14001 certifications are held by all current vendors. In FY 2023–24, these approved suppliers provided 
100% of the raw materials. The Company has set a target to use 40% sustainable materials by 2030. The Company’s achievement 
as of March 2024 is 28.4%.

Details of performance and career development reviews of employees and workers: 
10. 	 Health and safety management system: 
	
a.	
 Whether an occupational health and safety management 
system has been implemented by the entity? (Yes/ No). If 
yes, what is the coverage of such a system?
	
	
CEAT's manufacturing and production facilities are subject 
to the Occupational Health and Safety Management 
System (ISO 45001:2018), which is implemented in all 
manufacturing facilities and covers workers, employees, 
logistics (such as truck drivers and cleaners), service 
providers (such as contractual employees), visitors, 
transporters, vendors, and suppliers. 
	
	
The Occupational Health and Safety Management System 
is implemented, monitored, and evaluated by the Company 
using a corporate environment, health, and safety policy 
as well as a plant-specific environment, health, and safety 
policy. The Company uses training and awareness initiatives, 
safety audits, and frequent safety committee meetings to 
keep an eye on performance, best practices, and issues 
connected to environmental health and safety.
	
b. 	 What are the processes used to identify work-related 
hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine 
basis by the entity? 
	
	
To document occurrences, CEAT offers a number of 
platforms, including a mobile app, toolbox talk, safety 
meetings, daily work management meetings, and 
redbooks. Reporting on occurrences is recommended 
for employees. Supervisors and safety officials take 
the necessary steps to reduce and prevent similar 
incidents in the future, taking into account the type and 
frequency of the incident. All factories receive records 
and communications regarding problems that have been 
reported and investigated, which facilitate the horizontal 
deployment of remedial actions.
	
	
CEAT regularly performs occupational health and safety 
inspections as well as job safety analysis to measure risk. 
Hazards associated with work are quantified by evaluations 
of activity-based hazards; among the most significant risks 
are those connected to the control of health-harmful 
substances, manual material handling, equipment danger, 
display screen equipment, fire, and transportation.
	
	
In order to evaluate risks both regularly and irregularly, the 
Company also uses work permits to undertake ergonomic 
assessments and task hazard analysis. To reduce the risks, 
the Company evaluates the performance and state of the 
current control systems. The top 15 hazards are recognised 
as significant risks with an efficient risk management 
plan using the risk-control matrix. A hierarchy of controls 
has been taken into consideration when creating the 
Company's risk mitigation plan. Thus, engineering 
controls and their replacement or deletion are given top 
attention. The leadership evaluates the most important 
risks first, then engineering, the plant manager, the heads 
of the procurement, manufacturing, quality, and human 
resources departments, and finally the head of the plant.
	
	
The Company’s Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment 
("HIRA") includes the following tasks: task hazard analysis 
through work permits; activity risk assessment; Control 
of substances hazardous to health (COSHH) assessment; 
manual material handling assessment; DSE assessment; 
fire risk assessment; traffic risk assessment; and 
ergonomic assessment.

At both the corporate and factory levels, the Company periodically analyses its safety dashboard. Internal auditors analyse the 
health and safety management system twice a year as part of the safety evaluation process. In order to do impartial third-party 
evaluations at each of the manufacturing plants, the Company also hires safety specialists and health and safety organisations. The 
Company regularly takes fire and electrical safety into consideration.
	
c. 	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such risks. 
	
	
Indeed, CEAT has a clear procedure and framework in place to motivate employees to report events, dangerous situations, and near-
misses. Based on conventional safety procedures, CEAT offers a variety of training and awareness programs to guarantee that employees 
report occurrences. The workers get daily toolbox lectures about standard operating procedures linked to their work and job safety.
	
	
Signage and safety messages about potential work-related risks are provided by the plant safety team. Employees are required 
to report events on a monthly basis, and common incidents are evaluated, analysed, and closed with appropriate controls and 
procedures in place. The corresponding employees then provide feedback on the closure of the incident. 
	
	
For the purpose of reporting dangers, unsafe circumstances, unsafe conduct, and near misses, logbooks, Redbook, and mobile 
apps are available.
	
d. 	 Do the employees/ workers of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services? 
	
	
Yes, the Company’s personal accident and health insurance policies cover all of its employees. Additionally, the Company’s 
complies with all applicable regulations on non-occupational medical and healthcare services for employees, including those 
pertaining to Employees State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) benefits and provisions.
	
	
The Company has a Chief Fitness Officer (or "CFitO") who leads wellness and healthy lifestyle programs. Employees can get in 
touch with CFitO for any non-occupational medical needs.
	
	
At the manufacturing facilities, there is first aid and medical assistance along with the necessary and adequate Personal Protective 
Equipment (PPE).

10.  	Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your company 
to reduce the usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such 
wastes.
	
The Company practices environmentally conscious and compliance waste management for both hazardous and non-hazardous 
wastes. Through the application of the 4R principle—Reduce, Reuse, Recover, and Recycle—in its operations, the Company hopes to 
minimise waste generation, establish industry standards for waste management practices, and eventually move towards zero waste to 
landfill. All business processes are assessed for possible waste creation prior to operation, in accordance with the regulatory standards. 
The Company then looks into alternative resources, technology, and procedures that will allow waste generation optimisation in order 
to handle those wastes. These procedures are regularly reviewed, the necessary improvement measures are put in place, and they are 
consistently observed during business operations. 
	
According to EPR, CEAT is registered as the brand owner (PWMR). The Company is also working with the Automotive Tyre Manufacturers 
Association, or “ATMA,” to develop a framework for managing tyres that are nearing the end of their useful lives.

Independent Auditor’s Report
To the Members of CEAT Limited
Report on the Audit of the Standalone Financial 
Statements
Opinion
We have audited the standalone financial statements of CEAT 
Limited (the “Company”) which comprise the standalone balance 
sheet as at 31 March 2024, and the standalone statement of profit 
and loss (including other comprehensive income), standalone 
statement of changes in equity and standalone statement of cash 
flows for the year then ended, and notes to the standalone financial 
statements, including material accounting policies and other 
explanatory information.
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according 
to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial 
statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 
2013 (“Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view 
in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in 
India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at 31 March 2024, and 
its profit and other comprehensive loss, changes in equity and its 
cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing 
(SAs) specified under Section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities 
under those SAs are further described in the  Auditor’s Responsibilities 
for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements section of our 
report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the 
Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of 
India together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our 
audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions 
of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other 
ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the 
Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the 
standalone financial statements.
Key Audit Matter
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone 
financial statements of the current period. These matters were 
addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we 
do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Key audit matter	
See Note 26 to standalone financial statements
Revenue recognition on Sale of Products
How the matter was addressed in our audit
The Company recognises revenue from the sales of products when 
control over goods is transferred to the customer based on specific 
terms and conditions of sale contracts with respective customers.
We have identified recognition of revenue on sale of products as a 
key audit matter as –
 
 revenue is a key performance indicator; and
 
 there is a presumed fraud risk of revenue being overstated 
through manipulation of the timing of transfer of control due 
to pressures to achieve performance targets as well as meeting 
external expectations.
In view of the significance of the matter we applied the following 
audit procedures in this area, among others to obtain sufficient 
appropriate audit evidence:

Other Information
The Company’s Management and Board of Directors are responsible 
for the other information. The other information comprises the 
information included in the Company's annual report, but does not 
include the financial statements and auditor’s report thereon. The 
Company's annual report is expected to be made available to us 
after the date of this auditor’s report.
Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not cover 
the other information and we will not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the standalone financial statements, 
our responsibility is to read the other information identified above 
when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the 
other information is materially inconsistent with the standalone 
financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
When we read the Company's annual report, if we conclude that there 
is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate 
the matter to those charged with governance and take necessary 
actions, applicable under the applicable laws and regulations.
Management's and Board of Directors' Responsibilities 
for the Standalone Financial Statements
The Company’s Management and Board of Directors are responsible 
for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to 
the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs, profit/ loss and other 
comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows of the 
Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally 
accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind 
AS) specified under Section 133 of the Act. This responsibility also 
includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance 
with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of 
the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other 
irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting 
policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate 
internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for 
ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, 
relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone 
financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the standalone financial statements, the Management 
and Board of Directors are responsible for assessing the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, 
matters related to going concern and using the going concern 
basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to 
liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic 
alternative but to do so. 
The Board of Directors is also responsible for overseeing the 
Company’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Standalone Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the standalone financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s 
report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high 
level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted 
in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of 
users taken on the basis of these standalone financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional 
judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the 
audit. We also:
 

	Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the 
standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, 
design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, 
and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate 
to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a 
material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for 
one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, 
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of 
internal control.
 

	Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the 
audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate 
in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we 
are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether 
the company has adequate internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements in place and the operating 
effectiveness of such controls.
 

	Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used 
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related 
disclosures made by the Management and Board of Directors.
 

	Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management and Board 
of Directors use of the going concern basis of accounting in 
preparation of standalone financial statements and, based on 
the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty 
exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant 
doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If 
we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to 
draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures 
in the standalone financial statements or, if such disclosures are 
inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based 
on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s 
report. However, future events or conditions may cause the 
Company to cease to continue as a going concern. 
 

	Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the 
standalone financial statements, including the disclosures, and 
whether the standalone financial statements represent the 
underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves 
fair presentation.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, 
among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit 
and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies 
in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement 
that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding 
independence, and to communicate with them all relationships 
and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of most

significance in the audit of the standalone financial statements of the 
current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe 
these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation 
precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely 
rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be 
communicated in our report because the adverse consequences 
of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public 
interest benefits of such communication.

Annexure B to the Independent Auditor’s Report on
the Standalone Financial Statements of Ceat Limited
for the year ended 31 March 2024
Report on the internal financial controls with reference 
to the aforesaid standalone financial statements under 
Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Act
(Referred to in paragraph 2(A)(g) under ‘Report on 
Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of 
our report of even date)
Opinion
We have audited the internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements of CEAT Limited (“the Company”) as of 31 
March 2024 in conjunction with our audit of the standalone financial 
statements of the Company for the year ended on that date.
In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, adequate 
internal financial controls with reference to financial statements and 
such internal financial controls were operating effectively as at 31 
March 2024, based on the internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements criteria established by the Company 
considering the essential components of internal control stated 
in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over 
Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants 
of India (the “Guidance Note”).
Management’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities 
for Internal Financial Controls
The Company’s Management and the Board of Directors are 
responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial 
controls based on the internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements criteria established by the Company 
considering the essential components of internal control stated 
in the Guidance Note. These responsibilities include the design, 
implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial 
controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and 
efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to company’s 
policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection 
of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the 
accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial 
information, as required under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s 
internal financial controls with reference to financial statements 
based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the 
Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under 
Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of 
internal financial controls with reference to financial statements. 
Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply 
with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements were established 
and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all 
material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence 
about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit 
of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements 
included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements, assessing the risk that a 
material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and 
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed 
risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, 
including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of 
the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on 
the Company’s internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with Reference 
to Financial Statements
A company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance 
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation 
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements include 
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance 
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect 
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded 
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that 
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only 
in accordance with authorisations of management and directors 
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding 
prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or 
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect 
on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls 
with Reference to Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements, including the possibility of 
collusion or improper management override of controls, material 
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements to future periods are subject 
to the risk that the internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements may become inadequate because of changes 
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or 
procedures may deteriorate.

Note 1: Corporate Information
CEAT Limited (the ‘Company’) is a public limited company domiciled 
in India and incorporated under the provisions of the Companies 
Act applicable in India. The Company’s principal business is 
manufacturing of automotive tyres, tubes and flaps. The Company 
started operations in 1958 as CEAT Tyres of India Limited and was 
renamed as CEAT Limited in 1990. The Company caters to both 
domestic and international markets. The Company is listed on the 
Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange 
(NSE). The registered office of the Company is located at RPG House, 
463, Dr Annie Besant Road, Worli, Mumbai, Maharashtra 400030. The 
financial statements were approved for issue in accordance with a 
resolution of the Board of Directors on May 2, 2024.
Note 2: Basis of preparation, measurement and 
material accounting policies.
2.1	 Basis of preparation and measurement
	
2.1.1 Basis of preparation
	
	
These financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards 
(hereinafter referred to as the ‘Ind AS’) as notified by 
Ministry of Corporate Affairs pursuant to Section 133 of the 
Companies Act, 2013 read with Rule 3 of the Companies 
(Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 as amended 
from time to time and presentation requirements of 
Division II of revised Schedule III of the Companies Act 
2013 (Ind AS compliant Schedule III).
	
	
The financial statements have been prepared on accrual 
and going concern basis. The accounting policies are 
applied consistently to all the periods presented in the 
financial statements.
	
	
The financial statements are presented in “H”, the functional 
currency of the Company. Items included in the financial 
statements of the Company are recorded using the 
currency of the primary economic environment in which 
the Company operates (the ‘functional currency’).
	
	
All amounts disclosed in the financial statements and notes 
have been rounded off to the nearest lakhs as per the 
requirements of Schedule III of the Companies Act, 2013, 
unless otherwise stated. Wherever the amount represented 
‘0’ (zero) construes value less than Rupees fifty thousand.
	
2.1.2 Basis of Measurement
	
	
These financial statements are prepared under the 
historical cost convention except for the following assets 
and liabilities which have been measured at fair value:
 

Derivative financial instruments and
 

Investment in others (refer accounting policy 
regarding financial instruments)
	
	
In addition, the carrying values of recognised assets 
and liabilities designated as hedged items in fair value 
hedges that would otherwise be carried at amortised 
cost are adjusted to record changes in the fair values 
attributable to the risks that are being hedged in effective 
hedge relationships.
2.2	 Current versus non-current classification
	
The Company presents assets and liabilities in the Balance 
Sheet based on current / non-current classification. An asset is 
treated as current when it is:
 

Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or 
consumed in normal operating cycle.
 

Held primarily for the purpose of trading.
 

Expected to be realised within twelve months after the 
reporting period, or
	
Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged 
or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the 
reporting period.
	
All other assets are classified as non-current. 
	
A liability is current when:
 

It is expected to be settled in normal operating cycle.
 

It is held primarily for the purpose of trading.
 

It is due to be settled within twelve months after the 
reporting period, or
 

There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement 
of the liability for at least twelve months after the 
reporting period.
	
The Company classifies all other liabilities as non-current.
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current 
assets and liabilities.
	
The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition of 
assets for processing and their realisation in cash and cash 
equivalents. The Company has identified twelve months as its 
operating cycle.
2.3	 Revenue from operation & other income
	
2.3.1 Revenue from contracts with customers
	
	
Revenues from contracts with customers are recognised 
when the performance obligations towards customer have 
been met. Performance obligations are deemed to have been 
met when control of the goods or services are transferred to 
the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to 
which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for 
those goods or services. The Company acts as the principle in 
all of its revenue arrangements since it is the primary obligor 
in all the revenue arrangements as it has pricing latitude and 
is also exposed to inventory and credit risks.
	
	
An entity collects Goods and Services Tax (‘GST’) on behalf 
of the government and not on its own account. Hence it is 
excluded from revenue, i.e. Revenue is net of GST.
	
2.3.2 Sale of Goods
	
	
Revenue from sale of goods (Tyres, tubes and flaps) is 
recognised at the point of time when control of the goods 
is transferred to customer depending on terms of sales.

The Company considers whether there are other promises 
in the contract that are separate performance obligations 
to which a portion of the transaction price needs to be 
allocated (e.g. Sales related obligations). In determining 
the transaction price for the sale of goods, the Company 
considers the effects of variable consideration, the 
existence of significant financing components, if any.
	
	
2.3.2.1 Variable consideration
	
	
	
Variable consideration includes various forms of 
discounts like volume discounts, price concessions, 
incentives, etc. on the goods sold to its dealers and 
distributors. In all such cases, accumulated experience 
is used to estimate and provide for the variability in 
revenue, using the expected value method and the 
revenue is recognised to the extent that it is highly 
probable that a significant reversal in the amount 
of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur in 
future on account of refund or discounts.
	
	
2.3.2.2 Significant financing component
	
	
	
Generally, the Company receives short-term advances 
from its customers. Using the practical expedient 
in Ind AS 115, the Company does not adjust the 
promised amount of consideration for the effects 
of a significant financing component if it expects, 
at contract inception, that the period between 
the transfer of the promised good or service to the 
customer and when the customer pays for that good 
or service will be one year or less.
	
2.3.3 Contract balances 
	
	
Trade receivables
	
	
A receivable represents the Company’s right to an amount 
of consideration that is unconditional (i.e., only the passage 
of time is required before payment of the consideration 
is due). Refer to note 2.15 – Financial Instruments in 
accounting policies.
2.4	 Investments in subsidiaries and associates
	
Investments in subsidiaries and associates are carried at 
cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any. Where an 
indication of impairment exists, the carrying amount of the 
investment is assessed and written down immediately to its 
recoverable amount. On disposal of investments in subsidiaries 
and associates, the difference between net disposal proceeds 
and the carrying amounts are recognised in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss.
2.5	 Government grants, subsidies and export incentives
	
Government grants / subsidies are recognised in statement of 
profit and loss as per income approach when there is reasonable 
assurance that the Company will comply with all the conditions 
attached to them and that the grant / subsidy will be received.
	
The Company has determined that reasonable assurance is 
established upon receipt of sanction letter approving the 
incentive amount in accordance with the respective State 
Industrial Promotion Subsidy.
	
The Company has chosen to adjust grant under the 
Export Promotion Capital Goods (‘EPCG’) scheme from 
the carrying value of non-monetary asset pursuant to 
amendment in Ind AS 20.
2.6	 Taxes
	
2.6.1 Current tax
	
	
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the 
amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the 
taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used 
to compute the amount are those that are enacted or 
substantively enacted, at the reporting date in India where 
the Company operates and generates taxable income.
	
	
Current tax relating to items recognised outside 
the Statement of Profit and Loss is either in Other 
Comprehensive Income (‘OCI’) or in equity. Current tax 
items are recognised in correlation to the underlying 
transaction either in the Statement of Profit and 
Loss or directly in equity. Management periodically 
evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect 
to situations in which applicable tax regulations are 
subject to interpretation and establishes provisions 
where appropriate.
	
	
Interest expenses and penalties, if any, related to income 
tax are included in finance cost and other expenses 
respectively. Interest Income, if any, related to income tax 
is included in Other Income.
	
	
Uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of 
complex tax regulations and the amount and timing of 
future taxable income. Given the wide range of business 
relationships and the long-term nature and complexity 
of existing contractual agreements, differences arising 
between the actual results and the assumptions made, 
or future changes to such assumptions, could necessitate 
future adjustments to tax income and expense already 
recorded. The Company establishes provisions, based on 
reasonable estimates, for possible consequences of audits 
by the tax authorities of the respective countries in which 
it operates. The amount of such provisions is based on 
various factors, such as experience of previous tax audits 
and differing interpretations of tax regulations by the 
taxable entity and the responsible tax authority. Such 
differences of interpretation may arise on a wide variety 
of issues depending on the conditions prevailing in the 
Company’s domicile.
	
2.6.2 Deferred tax
	
	
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary 
differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
and their carrying amounts for financial reporting 
purposes at the reporting date.
	
	
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences, except:
 

	When the deferred tax liability arises from the initial 
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that 
is not a business combination and, at the time of the 
transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor 
taxable profit and loss.
 

In respect of taxable temporary differences associated 
with investments in subsidiaries and interests in 
joint ventures when the timing of the reversal of 
the temporary differences can be controlled and it 
is probable that the temporary differences will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future.
	
	
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible 
temporary differences, the carry forward of unused tax 
credits and any unused tax losses. Deferred tax assets are 
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable 
profit will be available against which the deductible 
temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused 
tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised, except:
 

When the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible 
temporary 
difference 
arises 
from 
the 
initial 
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that 
is not a business combination and, at the time of the 
transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor 
taxable profit and loss.
 

In respect of deductible temporary differences 
associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates 
and interests in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are 
recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the 
temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable 
future and taxable profit will be available against 
which the temporary differences can be utilised.
	
	
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at 
each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is 
no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be 
available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be 
utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are re-assessed 
at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent 
that it has become probable that future taxable profits will 
allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
	
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax 
rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset 
is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and 
tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted 
at the reporting date.
	
	
Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside the 
Statement of Profit and Loss is recognised either in 
OCI or in equity. Deferred tax items are recognised in 
correlation to the underlying transaction either in OCI or 
directly in equity.
	
	
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a 
legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets 
against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate 
to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
2.7	 Property, plant and equipment
	
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of 
accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, 
if any. Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of the plant 
and equipment and borrowing costs for long-term construction 
projects if the recognition criteria are met. When significant parts 
of plant and equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, 
the Company depreciates them separately based on their specific 
useful lives. Likewise, when a major inspection is performed, its cost 
is recognised in the carrying amount of the plant and equipment 
as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied. All other 
repair and maintenance costs are recognised in the Statement 
of Profit and Loss as incurred. The present value of the expected 
cost for the decommissioning of an asset after its use is included 
in the cost of the respective asset if the recognition criteria for a 
provision are met. Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only if 
it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with 
the expenditure will flow to the Company and the cost of the 
item can be measured reliably. The cost of property, plant and 
equipment at 1 April 2015, the company’s date of transition 
to Ind AS, was determined with reference to its carrying value 
recognised as per the previous GAAP (deemed cost), as at the date 
of transition to Ind AS.
	
An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant 
part initially recognised is derecognised upon disposal or 
when no future economic benefits are expected from its use 
or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the 
asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in 
the Statement of Profit and Loss when the asset is derecognised.
	
Property, plant and equipment which are not ready for 
intended use as on the date of Balance Sheet are disclosed as 
“Capital work-in-progress”.
	
Advances paid towards the acquisition of property, plant and 
equipment outstanding at each Balance Sheet date is classified 
as capital advances under “Other non-current assets”.
	
Depreciation is provided on a pro-rata basis on the straight-line 
method based on useful life estimated by the management 
and supported by independent assessment by professionals 
which may not be necessarily in the alignment with the 
useful lives prescribed by schedule II to the Companies Act, 
2013. Depreciation commences when the asset is ready for its 
intended use. The Company has used the following useful lives 
to provide depreciation on its fixed assets.
Asset Class
Useful life
Freehold land
Non depreciable
Buildings
(including temporary structures)
1 year - 60 years
Plant & Equipment
1 year - 20 years
Furniture & Fixture
1 year - 10 years
Vehicle
1 year - 8 years
Office Equipment

The identified components are depreciated over their useful 
lives, the remaining asset is depreciated over the life of the 
principal asset.
	
The management believes that the depreciation rates fairly 
reflect its estimation of the useful lives and residual values of 
the fixed assets.
	
The residual values, useful life and methods of depreciation of 
property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each financial 
year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.
2.8	 Intangible assets
	
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial 
recognition at cost. Following initial recognition, intangible 
assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation 
and accumulated impairment losses.
	
Internally generated intangibles, excluding capitalised 
development costs, are not capitalised and the related 
expenditure is reflected in the Statement of Profit and Loss in 
the period in which the expenditure is incurred. Subsequent 
expenditure is capitalised only if it is probable that the future 
economic benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to 
the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. 
The cost of intangible assets at 1 April 2015, the Company’s date 
of transition to Ind AS, was determined with reference to its 
carrying value recognized as per the previous GAAP (deemed 
cost), as at the date of transition to Ind AS.
	
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful 
economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is 
an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The 
amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives 
is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss unless such 
expenditure forms part of carrying value of another asset.
	
Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset 
are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds 
and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss when the asset is derecognised.
	
Intangible assets are amortised on a pro-rata basis on the 
straight-line method based on useful life estimated by the 
management as under:
Asset Class
Useful life
Software
1 Year – 6 years
Brand (refer 2.8.1)
20 years
Technical know-how (refer 2.8.1)
20 years
Product development (refer 2.8.2)
6 - 20 years
Design and Patent
4 – 25 years
	
2.8.1 Technical know-how and Brand
	
	
Technical know-how: The Company has originally 
generated technical know-how and assistance from 
International Tire Engineering Resources LLC, for setting up 
of Halol radial plant. Considering the life of the underlying 
plant / facility, this technical know-how, is amortised on a 
straight-line basis over a period of twenty years.
	
	
Brand: The Company has acquired global rights of “CEAT” 
brand from the Italian tyre maker, Pirelli. Prior to the said 
acquisition, the Company was the owner of the brand 
in only a few Asian countries including India. With the 
acquisition of the brand which is renowned worldwide, 
new and hitherto unexplored markets will be accessible 
to the Company. The Company will be in a position to fully 
exploit the export market resulting in increased volume 
and better price realisation. Therefore, the management 
believes that the Brand will yield significant benefits for a 
period of at least twenty years.
	
2.8.2 Research and development costs (Product development)
	
	
Research costs are charged to P&L as and when they are 
incurred. Development expenditures on an individual 
project are recognised as an intangible asset when the 
Company can demonstrate:
 

The technical feasibility of completing the intangible 
asset so that the asset will be available for use or sale.
 

Its intention to complete and its ability and intention 
to use or sell the asset.
 

How the asset will generate future economic benefits.
 

The availability of resources to complete the asset.
 

The ability to measure reliably the expenditure 
during development.
	
	
The amortisation period and the amortisation method for 
an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed 
at least at the end of each reporting period. Changes 
in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of 
consumption of future economic benefits embodied in 
the asset are considered to modify the amortisation period 
or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in 
accounting estimates.
2.9	 Borrowing costs
	
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a 
substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or 
sale (‘qualifying asset’) are capitalised as part of the cost of the 
asset. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in 
which they occur. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other 
costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of 
funds. Borrowing cost also includes exchange differences to 
the extent regarded as an adjustment to the borrowing costs.
	
To the extent that the Company borrows funds specifically 
for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset, the Company 
determines the amount of borrowing costs eligible for 
capitalisation as the actual borrowing costs incurred on that 
borrowing during the period less any investment income on 
the temporary investment of those borrowings.
	
To the extent that the Company borrows funds generally and 
uses them for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset, 
the Company determines the amount of borrowing costs 
eligible for capitalisation by applying a capitalisation rate 
to the expenditures on that asset. The capitalisation rate is 
the weighted average of the borrowing costs applicable to 
the borrowings of the Company that are outstanding during 
the period, other than borrowings made specifically for the 
purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset.
2.10 Leases
	
The Company has entered into various arrangements like 
lease of premises and outsourcing arrangements which has 
been disclosed accordingly under Ind AS 116. At inception of a 
contract, the Company assesses whether a contract is, or contains, 
a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys 
the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of 
time in exchange for consideration. The assessment of whether 
a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified 
asset depends on whether the Company obtains substantially all 
the economic benefits from the use of the asset and whether the 
Company has the right to direct the use of the asset.
	
Company as a lessee
	
The Company applies a single recognition and measurement 
approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and leases 
of low-value assets. The Company recognises lease liabilities to 
make lease payments and right-of-use assets representing the 
right to use the underlying assets.
	
2.10.1 Right-of-use assets
	
	
The Company recognizes right-of-use assets at the 
commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the 
underlying asset is available for use). The cost of right-
of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities 
recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease 
payments made at or before the commencement date 
less any lease incentives received. Right-of-use assets are 
measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and 
impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement 
of lease liabilities. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on 
a straight-line basis over shorter of the lease term or the 
estimated useful life of the underlying asset as follows:
Asset Class
Useful life
Building
1 – 11 years
Land
95 Years
Others (includes buildings & 
Plant & machinery)
2 – 10 years
	
	
If ownership of the leased asset transfers to the Company 
at the end of the lease term or the cost reflects the exercise 
of a purchase option, depreciation is calculated using the 
estimated useful life of the asset. The Company presents 
right-of-use assets separately in the Balance Sheet.
	
	
In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced 
by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain 
remeasurements of the lease liability. When the lease 
liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding 
adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-
of-use asset or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying 
amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.
	
2.10.2 Lease liabilities
	
	
At the commencement date of the lease, the Company 
recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value 
of future lease payments to be made over the lease term. 
The lease payments include fixed payments (including 
in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives 
receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an 
index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under 
residual value guarantees. The lease payments also 
include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably 
certain to be exercised by the Company and payments of 
penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects 
the Company exercising the option to terminate. Variable 
lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate 
are recognised as expenses (unless the cost is included in 
the carrying value of inventories) in the period in which 
the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.
	
	
In calculating the present value of lease payments, the 
Company uses its incremental borrowing rate at the 
lease commencement date because the interest rate 
implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the 
commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is 
increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced 
for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying 
amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a 
modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the 
lease payments (e.g., changes to future payments resulting 
from a change in an index or rate used to determine such 
lease payments) or a change in the assessment of an 
option to purchase the underlying asset.
	
	
The Company’s lease liabilities are included in current 
and non-current financial liabilities. Lease liability has 
been separately presented in the Balance Sheet and lease 
payments have been classified as financing cash flows.
	
2.10.3 Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets
	
	
The Company applies the short-term lease recognition 
exemption to the contracts which have a lease term of 
12 months or less from the date of commencement date 
and do not contain a purchase option. It also applies the 
lease of low-value assets recognition exemption to the 
lease contracts that are considered to be low value. Lease 
payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value 
assets are recognised as expense on a straight-line basis 
over the lease term.
2.11 Inventories
	
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value on item by item basis.

The cost of inventories includes expenditure incurred in 
acquiring the inventories, production or conversion costs and 
other costs incurred in bringing them to their present location 
and condition. Cost is determined on a weighted average basis:
 

Cost of raw materials includes the transfer of gains and 
losses on qualifying cash flow hedges, recognised in 
OCI, in respect of the purchases of raw materials. Raw 
materials and other items held for use in the production of 
inventories are not written down below cost if the finished 
products in which they will be incorporated are expected 
to be sold at or above cost.
 

Work-in-progress and finished goods includes direct 
materials, labour and a proportion of manufacturing 
overheads based on normal operating capacity but 
excluding borrowing cost.
 

Traded goods and stores & spares include cost of purchase 
and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to 
their present location and condition.
	
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary 
course of business, less estimated costs of completion and the 
estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
2.12 Provisions
	
Provisions are recognized when the Company has a present 
obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event 
and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying 
economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a 
reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. 
When the Company expects some or all of a provision to be 
reimbursed, for example, under an insurance contract, the 
reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset, but only when 
the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to 
a provision is presented in the Statement of Profit and Loss net 
of any reimbursement. If the effect of the time value of money 
is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax 
rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the 
liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision 
due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.
	
2.12.1 Sales related obligations
	
	
The estimated liability for sales related obligations is 
recorded when products are sold. These estimates are 
established using historical information on the nature, 
frequency and average cost of obligations and management 
estimates regarding possible future incidence based on 
corrective actions on product failure. The timing of outflows 
will vary as and when the obligation will arise - being 
typically up to three years. Initial recognition is based on 
historical experience. The initial estimate of sales related 
obligations (related costs) is revised annually.
	
2.12.2 Decommissioning liability
	
	
The Company records a provision for decommissioning 
costs of land taken on lease at one of the manufacturing 
facility for the production of tyres. Decommissioning costs 
are provided at the present value of expected costs to 
settle the obligation using estimated cash flows and are 
recognised as part of the cost of the particular asset. The 
cash flows are discounted at a current pre-tax rate that 
reflects the risks specific to the decommissioning liability. 
The unwinding of the discount is expensed as incurred and 
recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss as a finance 
cost. The estimated future costs of decommissioning are 
reviewed annually and adjusted as appropriate. Changes 
in the estimated future costs or in the discount rate applied 
are added to or deducted from the cost of the asset.
	
2.12.3 Litigations
	
	
The Company is party to various lawsuits that are at 
administrative or judicial level or in their initial stages, 
involving tax and civil matters. The Company contests 
all claims in the court / tribunals / appellate authority 
levels and based on their assessment and that of their 
legal counsel, records a provision when the risk or loss 
is considered probable. The outflow is expected on 
cessations of the respective events.
2.13 Employee benefits
	
2.13.1 Defined contribution plan
	
	
Retirement benefit in the form of Provident Fund, 
Superannuation, Employees State Insurance Contribution 
and Labour Welfare fund are defined contribution 
scheme. The Company has no obligation, other than the 
contribution payable to the above mentioned funds. The 
Company recognises contribution payable to these funds 
/ schemes as an expense when an employee renders the 
related service. If the contribution payable to the scheme 
for service received before the Balance Sheet date exceeds 
the contribution already paid, the deficit payable is 
recognised as a liability after deducting the contribution 
already paid. If the contribution already paid exceeds the 
contribution due for services received before the Balance 
Sheet date, then excess is recognised as an asset to the 
extent that the pre-payment will lead to, for example, a 
reduction in future payment or a cash refund.
	
	
2.13.1.1 Defined benefit plan
	
	
	
For defined benefit plans, the amount recognised as 
‘Employee benefit expenses’ in the Statement of Profit 
and Loss is the cost of accruing employee benefits 
promised to employees over the year and the costs of 
individual events such as past / future service benefit 
changes and settlements (such events are recognised 
immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss). The 
amount of net interest expense calculated by applying 
the liability discount rate to the net defined benefit 
liability or asset is charged or credited to ‘Finance costs’ 
in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Any differences 
between the expected interest income on plan assets 
and the return achieved, and any changes in the 
liabilities over the year due to changes in actuarial 
assumptions or experience adjustments within 
the plans, are recognised immediately in OCI and 
subsequently not reclassified to the Statement of 
Profit and Loss.
	
	
	
The defined benefit plan surplus or deficit on the 
Balance Sheet date comprises fair value of plan assets 
less the present value of the defined benefit liabilities 
using a discount rate by reference to market yields on 
Government bonds at the end of the reporting period.
	
	
	
All defined benefit plans obligations are determined 
based on valuations, as at the Balance Sheet date, 
made by independent actuary using the projected 
unit credit method. The classification of the 
Company’s net obligation into current and non-
current is as per the actuarial valuation report.
	
	
	
When the benefits of a plan are changed or when 
a plan is curtailed, the resulting change in benefit 
that relates to past service (‘past service cost’ or ‘past 
service gain’) or the gain or loss on curtailment is 
recognised immediately in profit or loss. The Company 
recognizes gains and losses on the settlement of a 
defined benefit plan when the settlement occurs.
	
2.13.2 Termination benefits
	
	
Termination benefits, in the nature of voluntary retirement 
benefits or termination benefits arising from restructuring 
are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss. The 
Company recognises termination benefits at the earlier of 
the following dates:
 

When the Company can no longer withdraw the offer 
of those benefits; or
 

When the Company recognises costs for a restructuring 
that is within the scope of Ind AS 37: Provisions, 
Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets and 
involves the payment of termination benefits.
	
	
Benefits falling due more than 12 months after the end of 
the reporting period are discounted to their present value.
2.14 Financial instruments
	
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a 
financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity 
instrument of another entity.
	
2.14.1 Financial assets
	
	
Financial assets are recognized when the Company 
becomes a party to the contractual provisions of 
the instrument.
	
	
2.14.1.1 Initial recognition and measurement
	
	
	
On initial recognition, a financial asset is recognised 
at fair value. In case of financial assets which are 
recognised at fair value through profit and loss 
(FVTPL) except for trade receivables without financing 
component which are measured at transaction price, 
its transaction cost is recognised in the Statement 
of Profit and Loss. In other cases, the transaction 
cost is attributed to the acquisition value of the 
financial asset.
	
	
2.14.1.2 Subsequent measurement
	
	
	
For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial 
assets are classified in two categories:
	
	
	
2.14.1.2.1 Debt instruments at amortised cost
	
	
	
2.14.1.2.2 Equity instruments measured at FVTOCI
	
	
	
2.14.1.2.1 Debt instruments at amortised cost
	
	
	
	
A debt instrument is measured at the amortised 
cost if both the following conditions are met:
 

	The asset is held within a business model 
whose objective is to hold assets for 
collecting contractual cash flows; and
 

Contractual terms of the asset give rise on 
specified dates to cash flows that are Solely 
Payments of Principal and Interest (‘SPPI’) 
on the principal amount outstanding.
	
	
	
	
After initial measurement, such financial assets 
are subsequently measured at amortised 
cost using the EIR method. Amortised cost is 
calculated by taking into account any discount 
or premium on acquisition and fees or costs 
that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR 
amortisation is included in finance income in 
the Statement of Profit and Loss. The losses 
arising from impairment are recognised in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss. This category 
generally applies to other receivables, loans and 
other financial assets.
	
	
	
2.14.1.2.2 Equity instruments
	
	
	
	
All investments in equity instruments within 
the scope of Ind AS 109 are initially measured 
at fair value. Equity instruments which are 
held for trading are classified as FVTPL. For all 
other equity instruments, the Company may 
make an irrevocable election to present in the 
OCI subsequent changes in the fair value. The 
Company makes such election on an instrument-
by-instrument basis. The classification is made 
on initial recognition and is irrevocable.
	
	
	
	
In case of equity instrument classified as 
FVTOCI, all fair value changes on the instrument, 
excluding dividends, are recognised in the OCI. 
There is no recycling of the amounts from OCI 
to the Statement of Profit and Loss, even on 
derecognition of investment. However, the 
Company may transfer the cumulative gain or 
loss within equity.

Equity instruments included within the FVTPL 
category are measured at fair value with 
all changes recognised in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss.
	
	
2.14.1.3 Derecognition
	
	
	
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a 
financial asset or part of a group of similar financial 
assets) is primarily derecognised when:
 

The rights to receive cash flows from the asset 
have expired; or
 

The Company has transferred its rights to receive 
cash flows from the asset or has assumed an 
obligation to pay the received cash flows in full 
without material delay to a third party under 
a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; and either (a) 
the Company has transferred substantially all 
the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the 
Company has neither transferred nor retained 
substantially all the risks and rewards of the 
asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
	
	
	
When the Company has transferred its rights to 
receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into 
a pass- through arrangement, it evaluates if and to 
what extent it has retained the risks and rewards 
of ownership. When it has neither transferred nor 
retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of 
the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the 
Company continues to recognise the transferred 
asset to the extent of the Company’s continuing 
involvement. In that case, the Company also 
recognises an associated liability. The transferred 
asset and the associated liability are measured on a 
basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the 
Company has retained.
	
	
	
Continuing involvement that takes the form of a 
guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at 
the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset 
and the maximum amount of consideration that the 
Company could be required to repay.
	
	
2.14.1.4 Impairment of financial assets
	
	
	
In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company applies 
Expected Credit Loss (‘ECL’) model for measurement 
and recognition of impairment loss on the following 
financial assets and credit risk exposure:
	
	
	
(i)	
Trade receivables
	
	
	
(ii)	 Financial assets measured at amortised cost 
(other than trade receivables)
	
	
	
(iii)	 Financial assets measured at fair value through 
other comprehensive income (FVTOCI).
	
	
	
The Company follows ‘simplified approach’ for 
recognition of impairment loss allowance on trade 
receivables. The application of simplified approach 
does not require the Company to track changes 
in credit risk. Rather, it recognises impairment loss 
allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting 
date, right from its initial recognition.
	
	
	
For recognition of impairment loss on other financial 
assets [i.e. (ii) and (iii) above] and risk exposure, 
the Company determines that whether there has 
been a significant increase in the credit risk since 
initial recognition. If credit risk has not increased 
significantly, 12 month ECL is used to provide for 
impairment loss. However, if credit risk has increased 
significantly, lifetime ECL is used. If, in a subsequent 
period, credit quality of the instrument improves 
such that there is no longer a significant increase in 
credit risk since initial recognition, then the entity 
reverts to recognising impairment loss allowance 
based on 12 month ECL.
	
	
	
Lifetime ECL are the expected credit losses resulting 
from all possible default events over the expected 
life of a financial instrument. The 12 month ECL is a 
portion of the lifetime ECL which results from default 
events that are possible within 12 months after the 
reporting date.
	
	
	
ECL is the difference between all contractual cash 
flows that are due to the Company in accordance 
with the contract and all the cash flows that the entity 
expects to receive (i.e. all cash shortfalls), discounted 
at the original EIR. When estimating the cash flows, an 
entity is required to consider:
 

All contractual terms of the financial instrument 
(including prepayment, extension, call and 
similar options) over the expected life of the 
financial instrument. However, in rare cases when 
the expected life of the financial instrument 
cannot be estimated reliably, then the entity is 
required to use the remaining contractual term 
of the financial instrument.
 

Cash flows from the sale of collateral held or 
other credit enhancements that are integral to 
the contractual terms.
	
	
	
As a practical expedient, the Company uses a provision 
matrix to determine impairment loss allowance on 
portfolio of its trade receivables. The provision matrix is 
based on its historically observed default rates over the 
expected life of the trade receivables and is adjusted 
for forward-looking estimates. At every reporting date, 
the historical observed default rates and changes 
in the forward-looking estimates are updated. For 
assessing increase in credit risk and impairment loss, 
the Company combines financial instruments on the 
basis of shared credit risk characteristics with the 
objective of facilitating an analysis that is designed 
to enable significant increases in credit risk to be 
identified on a timely basis.
	
	
	
ECL 
impairment 
loss 
allowance 
(or 
reversal) 
recognised during the period is recognised as 
income/expense in the Statement of Profit and 
Loss. This amount is reflected under the head ‘other 
expenses’ in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
	
	
The Balance Sheet presentation for various financial 
instruments is described below:
 

	Financial assets measured at amortised cost 
and contractual revenue receivables: ECL is 
presented as an allowance, i.e. as an integral 
part of the measurement of those assets in 
the Balance Sheet. The allowance reduces the 
net carrying amount. Until the asset meets 
write-off criteria, the Company does not 
reduce impairment allowance from the gross 
carrying amount.
	
	
	
The Company does not have any purchased or 
originated credit-impaired financial assets, i.e., 
financial assets which are credit impaired on 
purchase / origination.
	
2.14.2 Financial liabilities
	
	
2.14.2.1 Initial recognition and measurement
	
	
	
Financial liabilities are recognized when the Company 
becomes a party to the contractual provisions of 
the instrument. All financial liabilities are recognised 
initially at fair value and in the case of borrowings net 
of directly attributable transaction costs.
	
	
2.14.2.2 Subsequent measurement
	
	
	
The measurement of financial liabilities depends on 
their classification, as described below:
	
	
	
2.14.2.2.1 Financial liabilities at amortised cost
	
	
	
	
This is the category most relevant to the 
Company. After initial recognition, financial 
liabilities 
are 
subsequently 
measured 
at 
amortised cost using the EIR method. Gains and 
losses are recognised in the Statement of Profit 
and Loss when the liabilities are derecognised as 
well as through the EIR amortisation process.
	
	
	
	
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into 
account any discount or premium on acquisition 
and fees or costs that are an integral part of the 
EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as finance 
costs in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
	
2.14.2.3	 Derecognition
	
	
	
A financial liability is derecognised when the 
obligation under the liability is discharged or 
cancelled or expires. When an existing financial 
liability is replaced by another from the same 
lender on substantially different terms, or the terms 
of an existing liability are substantially modified, 
such an exchange or modification is treated as 
the derecognition of the original liability and the 
recognition of a new liability. The difference in the 
respective carrying amounts is recognised in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
2.14.3 Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
	
	
The Company uses derivative financial instruments, such 
as forward currency contracts, to manage its foreign 
currency risks. These derivative instruments are designated 
as cash flow, fair value or net investment hedges and are 
entered into for period consistent with currency. Such 
derivative financial instruments are initially recognised 
at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract 
is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair 
value. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the 
fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair 
value is negative. Any gains or losses arising from changes 
in the fair value of derivatives are taken directly to the 
Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
	
2.14.3.1 Cash flow hedges
	
	
	
The effective portion of the gain or loss on the 
hedging instrument is recognised in OCI in the cash 
flow hedge reserve, while any ineffective portion 
is recognised immediately in the Statement of 
Profit or Loss.
	
	
	
The Company uses forward currency contracts as 
hedges of its exposure to foreign currency risk in 
forecast transactions and firm commitments. The 
ineffective portion relating to foreign currency 
contracts is recognised in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss.
	
	
	
Amounts recognised as OCI are transferred to the 
Statement of Profit and Loss when the hedged 
transaction affects profit and loss, i.e. when the 
hedged financial income or financial expense is 
recognised or when a forecast sale occurs. When the 
hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or 
non-financial liability, the amounts recognised as OCI 
are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the 
non-financial asset or liability.
	
	
	
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, 
terminated or exercised without replacement or 
rollover (as part of the hedging strategy), or if its 
designation as a hedge is revoked, or when the hedge 
no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, 
any cumulative gain or loss previously recognised 
in OCI remains separately in equity until the forecast 
transaction occurs or the foreign currency firm 
commitment is met.
	
2.14.4 Fair value measurement
	
	
The Company measures derivatives instruments like 
forward contracts at fair value at each Balance Sheet date.
	
	
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an 
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the measurement date.

Notes to Standalone Financial Statements
for the year ended March 31, 2024
The fair value measurement is based on the presumption 
that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability 
takes place either:
 

In the principal market for the asset or liability; or
 

In the absence of a principal market, in the most 
advantageous market for the asset or liability.
	
	
The principal or the most advantageous market must be 
accessible by the Company.
	
	
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using 
the assumptions that market participants would use 
when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market 
participants act in their economic best interest.
	
	
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes 
into account a market participant’s ability to generate 
economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and 
best use or by selling it to another market participant that 
would use the asset in its highest and best use.
	
	
The Company uses valuation techniques that are 
appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient 
data are available to measure fair value, maximising the 
use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use 
of unobservable inputs.
	
	
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured 
or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised 
within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based 
on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement as a whole:
 

Level 1 : Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active 
markets for identical assets or liabilities
 

Level 2 : Valuation techniques for which the lowest 
level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement is directly or indirectly observable
 

Level 3 : Valuation techniques for which the lowest 
level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement is unobservable
	
	
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the 
financial statements on a recurring basis, the Company 
determines whether transfers have occurred between 
levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation 
(based on the lowest level input that is significant to the 
fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each 
reporting period.
	
	
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Company has 
determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of 
the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability 
and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above.
	
2.14.5 Offsetting of financial instruments
	
	
Financial assets and financial liabilities can be offset and 
the net amount is reported in the Balance Sheet if there is 
a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised 
amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to 
realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
2.15 Cash and cash equivalents
	
Cash and cash equivalent in the Balance Sheet comprises cash 
at banks and on hand. For the purpose of cash flow statement, 
Cash & Cash equivalent consists of cash & short term deposits 
as defined above. The Cash flow statement is prepared using 
indirect method.
2.16 Dividend distribution to equity shareholders
	
The Company recognises a liability to pay dividend to equity 
shareholders of the Company when the distribution is 
authorised and the distribution is no longer at the discretion of 
the Company. As per the corporate laws in India, a distribution 
is authorised when it is approved by the shareholders.
2.17 Foreign currencies
	
The Company’s financial statements are presented in H, which is 
also the Company’s functional currency.
	
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the 
Company at H spot rate at the date the transaction first qualifies 
for recognition. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency 
spot rates of exchange at the reporting date.
	
Exchange differences arising on settlement or translation 
of monetary items are recognised in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss.
	
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical 
cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange 
rates at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary 
items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated 
using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value is 
determined. The gain or loss arising on translation of non-
monetary items measured at fair value is treated in line with the 
recognition of the gain or loss on the change in fair value of the 
item (i.e., translation differences on items whose fair value gain 
or loss is recognised in OCI or profit and loss are also recognised 
in OCI or the Statement of Profit and Loss, respectively).
2.18 Earnings Per Share (‘EPS’)
	
Basic EPS amounts are calculated by dividing the profit for 
the year attributable to equity holders of the Company by 
the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding 
during the year.
	
Diluted EPS amounts are calculated by dividing the profit 
attributable to equity holders of the Company after adjusting 
impact of dilution shares by the weighted average number of 
equity shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted 
average number of equity shares that would be issued 
on conversion of all the dilutive potential equity shares 
into equity shares.
2.19 Segment Reporting
	
The Executive Management Committee evaluates the 
Company's 
performance 
and 
allocates 
the 
resources 
based on an analysis of various performance indicators by 
business segments.
	
The Company prepares its segment information in conformity 
with the accounting policies adopted for preparing and 
presenting the financial statements of the Company as a whole.
2.20 Contingent liabilities and assets
	
A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises 
from past events whose existence will be confirmed by the 
occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain 
future events not wholly within the control of the Company 
or a present obligation that is not recognised because it is not 
probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle 
the obligation. A contingent liability also arises in extremely 
rare cases where there is a liability that cannot be recognised 
because it cannot be measured reliably. The Company does not 
recognise a contingent liability but discloses its existence in the 
financial statements.
2.21	Significant 
accounting 
judgments, 
estimates 
and 
assumptions
	
The preparation of the financial statements requires management 
to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the 
reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, 
and the accompanying disclosures, and the disclosure of 
contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these assumptions and 
estimates could result in outcomes that require an adjustment 
to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities in future periods. 
Difference between actual results and estimates are recognised 
in the periods in which the results are known / materialised.
	
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key 
sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that 
have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to 
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next 
financial year, are described below. The Company has based 
its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when 
the financial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances 
and assumptions about future developments, however, may 
change due to market changes or circumstances arising that 
are beyond the control of the Company. Such changes are 
reflected in the assumptions when they occur.
	
Information about critical judgments in applying accounting 
policies, as well as estimates and assumptions that have the 
most significant effect to the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities within the next financial year, are included in the 
following notes:
	
(a)	 Measurement of defined benefit obligations – note 37
	
(b)	 Measurement and likelihood of occurrence of provisions 
and contingencies – note 20
	
(c)	 Recognition of current tax and deferred tax assets – note 21
	
(d)	 Key assumptions used in fair valuations – note 43
	
(e)	 Measurement of lease liabilities and right-of-use asset – note 4

Significant Judgements in determining the lease term of contracts with renewal and termination options:
	
The Company determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to 
extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably 
certain not to be exercised.
	
The Company has several lease contracts that include extension and termination options. The Company applies judgement in 
evaluating whether it is reasonably certain whether or not to exercise the option to renew or terminate the lease. That is, it considers all 
relevant factors that create an economic incentive for it to exercise either the renewal or termination. After the commencement date, 
the Company reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that is within its control and affects its 
ability to exercise or not to exercise the option to renew or to terminate.

The Company included the renewal period as part of the lease term for leases of buildings and other with shorter non-cancellable 
period. The Company typically exercises its option to renew for these leases because there will be a significant negative effect on 
the operations if a replacement asset is not readily available. The renewal periods for leases of building and others with longer non-
cancellable periods are not included as part of the lease term as these are not reasonably certain to be exercised. Furthermore, the 
periods covered by termination options are included as part of the lease term only when they are reasonably certain not to be exercised.
d)	
The Company has lease contracts for plant & machinery that contains variable payments amounting to H 18,215 lakhs ( H 15,271 lakhs 
in March 31, 2023) shown under other expenses.
e)	
The Company has recognised H 917 lakhs as miscellaneous expenses during the year ( H 921 lakhs in March 31, 2023) which pertains to 
short term lease/ low value asset which was not recognised as part of ROU.

Provision for compensated absences
	
Employee leaves are encashed as per the Company's leave encashment policy. A provision has been recognised for leave encashment 
liability based on the actuarial valuation of leave balance of employees as at year end.
b)	 Provision for sales related obligation
	
A provision is recognized for expected sales related obligation on product sold during the last three years, based on past experience 
of the level of returns and cost of claim. It is expected that significant portion of these costs will be incurred in the next financial year 
and within three years from the reporting date. Assumptions used to calculate the provision for sales related obligation were based on 
current sales levels and current information available about returns based on the three years period for all products sold. The rate used 
for discounting provision for sales related obligation is 9%. The table below gives information about movement in provision for sales 
related obligation.
c)	
Provision for decommissioning liability
	
The Company has recognised a provision for decommissioning obligations associated with a land taken on lease at Nashik manufacturing 
facility for the production of tyres. In determining the fair value of the provision, assumptions and estimates are made in relation to 
discount rates, the expected cost to dismantle and remove the plant from the site and the expected timing of those costs. The Company 
estimates that the costs would be realised in year 2066 at the expiration of the lease and calculates the provision using the Discounted 
Cash Flow (DCF) method based on the following assumptions:
	
-	
Estimated range of cost per square meter: H 45 – H 50
	
-	
Discount rate: 11.50%

Defined contribution plan
	
Refer note 30 for Company’s contribution to the defined contribution plans with respect to provident fund and other funds.
b)	 Defined benefit plan - Gratuity
	
Description of plan
	
The Company has a defined benefit gratuity plan which is funded with an Insurance Company in the form of a qualifying Insurance 
policy. The Company's defined benefit gratuity plan is a salary plan for employees which requires contributions to be made to a 
separate administrative fund. The gratuity plan is governed by the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. Under the act, every employee who 
has completed five years of service gets a gratuity on separation at 15 days of last drawn salary for each completed year of service.
	
Governance
	
The fund has the form of a trust and it is governed by the Board of Trustees, which consists of employer and employee representatives. 
The Board of  Trustees is responsible for the administration of the plan assets and for the definition of the investment strategy. Each year, 
the Board of Trustees reviews the level of funding.
	
Investment Strategy
	
The Board of trustees have appointed LIC of India, Birla Sun Life Insurance, India First Life Insurance, Kotak Mahindra Life Insurance & 
HDFC Life Insurance to manage its funds. The Board of  Trustees aim to keep annual contributions relatively stable at a level such that no 
plan deficits (based on valuation performed) will arise. Every year, the insurance Company carries out a funding valuation based on the 
latest employee data provided by the Company. Any deficit in the assets arising as a result of such valuation is funded by the Company. 
In case of death, while in service, the gratuity is payable irrespective of vesting.

The plan exposes the Company to the risk of fall in interest rates. A fall in interest rates will 
result in an increase in the ultimate cost of providing the above benefit and will thus result in an 
increase in the value of the liability (as shown in financial statements).
Investment
The probability or likelihood of occurrence of losses relative to the expected return on any 
particular investment.
Demographic
The Company has used certain mortality and attrition assumptions in valuation of the liability. 
The Company is exposed to the risk of actual experience turning out to be worse compared to the 
assumption.
Salary Escalation 
The present value of the defined benefit plan is calculated with the assumption of salary increase 
rate of plan participants in future. Deviation in the rate of increase of salary in future for plan 
participants from the rate of increase in salary used to determine the present value of obligation 
will have a bearing on the plan's liability.
Asset Liability Mismatching 
or Market Risk
The duration of the liabilty is longer compared to duration of assets, exposing the Company to 
market risk for volatilities/fall in interest rate.
Regulatory Risk
Gratuity benefit is paid in accordance with the requirements of the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 
(as amended from time to time). There is a risk of change in regulations requiring higher gratuity 
payouts (e.g. Increase in the maximum limit on gratuity of H 20,00,000).
	
x)	
Weighted average duration and expected employers contribution for the next year for the defined benefit plan
	
	
The weighted average duration (based on discounted cash flows) of defined benefit obligation is 11 years.

The Competition Commission of India (‘CCI’) on February 02, 2022 had released its order dated August 31, 2018 against the 
Company and other Tyre Manufacturers and also the Automotive Tyre Manufacturer Association (ATMA) concerning contravention 
of the provisions of the Competition Act, 2002 in the year 2011-12 and imposed a penalty of H 25,216 lakhs on the Company. The 
Company had filed an appeal against the CCI Order before the Honourable National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT). 
NCLAT in its order dated December 01, 2022, has remitted the matter back to the CCI to re-examine the order and to consider 
reviewing the penalty pointing out certain errors leading to wrong conclusions. CCI has filed an Appeal before the Supreme Court 
against the Order passed by the NCLAT.  Company is also a Respondent in the said Appeal and has filed its reply to the CCl's appeal 
on December 28, 2023. No interim order has been passed by the Supreme Court. The Appeal is pending before the Supreme Court.

Commitments
c.	
Others
	
The Company has availed the Sales Tax Deferral Loan and Octroi refund from the Directorate of Industries for Nashik Plant. Hence, the 
Company has to take prior permission of the appropriate authority for removal / transfer of any asset (falling under the above Schemes) 
from Nashik Plant. In case of violation of terms & conditions, the Company is required to refund the entire loan / benefit along with the 
interest @ 22.50% on account of Sales Tax deferral Loan and @ 15% on account of Octroi refund. 
d.	
Material demands and disputes considered as “Remote” by the Company
	
The Company has been served with a Show Cause cum Demand Notice from the DGCEI (Directorate General of Central Excise 
Intelligence) Mumbai, on the ground that, the activity of making tyre set, i.e. inserting Tubes and Flaps inside the Tyres and tied up 
through Polypropylene Straps, amounts to manufacture / pre-packaged commodity under Section 2(f)(iii) of Central Excise Act, read 
with Section 2(l) of the Legal Metrology Act, 2009. Accordingly, the authorities worked out the differential duty amounting to H 27,672 
lakhs i.e., the difference between the amount of duty already paid on the basis of transaction value and duty payable on the basis of 
MRP under Section 4A, for the period from April 2011 to June 2017. The Company believes that Set of TT / TTF (Tyre and Tube / Tyre, Tube 
and Flap) is not a pre-packaged commodity in terms of provisions of Legal Metrology Act, 2009 read with Central Excise Act and Rules 
made thereunder. The Company has a strong case on the ground that, the said issue has been clarified by the Controller of the Legal 
Metrology Department vide its letter dated May 01, 1991 that “Tyre with tube & flaps tied with three thin polythene strips may not be 
treated as a pre-packed commodity within the meaning of rule 2(l) of the Standards of  Weights and Measures (Packaged Commodities), 
Rules, 1977”.  The above clarification has been re-affirmed vide letter dated November 16, 1992 by the Legal Metrology authorities.

The terms of the foreign currency forward contracts match the terms of the expected highly probable forecast transactions. As a result, no 
hedge ineffectiveness arise requiring recognition through the Statement of Profit and Loss.	 	
	
	
	
The cash flow hedges as at March 31, 2024 were assessed to be highly effective and a net unrealised loss of H 268 lakhs, with a deferred tax 
asset of H 67 lakhs relating to the hedging instruments, is included in OCI. Comparatively, the cash flow hedges as at March 31, 2023 were 
assessed to be highly effective and a net unrealised gain of H1,150 lakhs, with a deferred tax liability of H 289 lakhs relating to the hedging 
instruments, was included in OCI.

Note 42: Fair values	
	
	
	
	
	
	
The management considers that the carrying value of financial assets and financial liabilities which are recognised at amortised cost are a 
reasonable approximation of their fair values.
Note 43: Fair value hierarchy 	
	
	
	
	
	
	
The fair value of financial instruments as referred to in note 42 above have been classified into three categories depending on the inputs 
used in the valuation technique. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
(Level 1 measurements) and lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).
The categories used are as follows:
 

Level 1: Quoted prices for identical instruments in an active market;
 

Level 2: Directly or indirectly observable market inputs, other than Level 1 inputs; and
 

Level 3: Inputs which are not based on observable market data.
The following table provides the fair value measurement hierarchy of the Company’s assets and liabilities as at March 31, 2024 
and March 31, 2023
Calculation of Fair Values
The fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are defined as the price that would be received on sale of an asset or paid to transfer a 
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair 
values are consistent with those used for the year ended March 31, 2023.
Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value as at Balance Sheet date:
Derivative financial instruments: The fair values of the derivative financial instruments has been determined using valuation techniques 
with market observable inputs. The models incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of counter-parties, foreign exchange 
forward rates, etc.
Investment in others: The fair value is calculated using the Discounted Cashflow method where the significant unobservable input used 
is discount rate - 18.64%.

Note 44 : Financial risk management objectives and policies
The Company’s principal financial liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise loans and borrowings, trade and other payables. The main 
purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the Company’s operations. The Company’s principal financial assets include trade and other 
receivables, cash and cash equivalents that derive directly from its operations. The Company also enters into derivative transactions.
The Company’s financial risk activities are governed by appropriate policies and procedures and that financial risks are identified, measured 
and managed in accordance with the Company’s policies and risk objectives. All derivative activities for risk management purposes 
are carried out by specialist teams that have the appropriate skills, experience and supervision. The Board of Directors through its Risk 
Management Committee reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.

Risk
Exposure
Risk Management
Risk that the fair value 
or future cash flows of a 
financial instrument will 
fluctuate because of changes 
in market interest rates.
Relates primarily to the 
Company’s long-term 
debt obligations with 
floating interest rates.
The Company manages its interest rate risk pertaining to domestic 
borrowings by maintaining a balanced portfolio of borrowings 
linked to various tenor benchmark of MCLR, Repo rate and T-Bills. 
The Company enters into interest rate swaps, in which it agrees to 
exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and 
variable rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-
upon notional principal amount.
As at March 31, 2024, after taking into account the effect of interest 
rate swaps, approximately 34% of the Company’s total borrowings are 
at a fixed rate of interest (March 31, 2023: 30%).
Risk
Exposure
Risk Management
Risk that the fair value or 
future cash flows of an 
exposure will fluctuate 
because of changes in 
foreign exchange rates. 
Relates primarily to the 
Company’s operating 
activities (when 
revenue or expense 
is denominated in a 
foreign currency).
For the committed transactions, The Company manages its foreign 
currency risk by hedging transactions till the actual date of inflow & 
outflow. When a derivative is entered into for the purpose of being a hedge, 
the Company negotiates the terms of those derivatives to match the terms 
of the hedged exposure. For hedges of forecast transactions, the derivatives 
cover the period of exposure from the point the cash flows of the 
transactions are forecasted up to the point of settlement of the resulting 
receivable or payable that is denominated in the foreign currency.
As at March 31, 2024, the Company has hedged 88% (March 31, 2023: 99%) 
of its foreign currency receivables / payables.

The above risks may affect the Company’s income and expenses, or the value of its financial instruments. The Company’s exposure to 
and management of these risks are explained below.
	
The sensitivity of the relevant Statement of Profit or Loss item is the effect of the assumed changes in respective market risks. This is 
based on the financial assets and financial liabilities held at March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022 including the effect of hedge accounting.

Interest rate sensitivity
	
	
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates on that portion of loans and 
borrowings affected, after the impact of hedge accounting. With all other variables held constant, the Company’s profit before tax 
is affected through the impact on floating rate borrowings, as follows:

Foreign currency risk
	
	
Foreign currency sensitivity
	
	
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in USD and EURO rates, with all other variables

The movement in the pre-tax effect is a result of a change in the fair value of the financial asset / liability due to the exchange rate 
movement. The derivatives which have not been designated in a hedge relationship act as an economic hedge and will offset the 
underlying transactions when they occur. The same derivatives are not covered in the above table.
	
	
In Management’s opinion, the sensitivity analysis is unrepresentative of the inherent foreign exchange risk because the exposure 
at the end of the reporting period does not reflect the exposure during the year.
	
iii.	 Equity price risk
	
	
There is no material equity risk relating to the Company’s equity investments which are detailed in note 6. The Company's equity 
investments majorly comprises of strategic investments rather than trading purposes.
	
iv.	 Commodity price risk

The following table approximately details the Company’s sensitivity to a 5% movement in the input price of rubber and carbon 
black. The sensitivity analysis includes only 5% change in commodity prices for quantity sold or consumed during the year, with 
all other variables held constant. A positive number below indicates an increase in profit or equity where the commodity prices 
decrease by 5%. For a 5% increase in commodity prices, there would be a comparable impact on profit or equity, and the balances 
below would be negative.

Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are generally on 27 days to 60 days credit term. Credit limits are established for all 
customers based on internal rating criteria. Outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored. An impairment analysis is 
performed at each reporting date on an individual basis for major customers. In addition, a large number of minor receivables are 
grouped into homogenous groups and assessed for impairment collectively. The Company has no concentration of credit risk as the 
customer base is widely distributed both economically and geographically.
	
Export receivables are against Letter of Credit, bank guarantees, payment against documents. For open credit exports insurance cover 
is taken. Generally deposits are taken from domestic debtors under replacement segment. The carrying amount and fair value of 
security deposit from dealers amounts to H 53,862 lakhs (March 31, 2023: H 49,389 lakhs) as it is payable on demand. The maximum 
exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financial assets.

Note 45: Capital management
For the purpose of the Company's capital management, capital includes issued equity capital, share premium and all other equity reserves 
attributable to the equity holders of the Company. The primary objective of the Company’s capital management is to maximise the 
shareholder value. 
The Company manages its capital structure and makes adjustments in light of changes in economic conditions and the requirements of 
the financial covenants. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Company may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return 
capital to shareholders or issue new shares. The Company monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is net debt divided by total capital 
plus net debt. The Company includes within net debt, interest bearing loans and borrowings, less cash and cash equivalents.

In order to achieve this overall objective, the Company’s capital management, amongst other things, aims to ensure that it meets financial 
covenants attached to the interest-bearing loans and borrowings that define capital structure requirements. Breaches in meeting the 
financial covenants would permit the bank to immediately call loans and borrowings. There have been no breaches in the financial covenants 
of any interest-bearing loans and borrowing in the current period.
No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes for managing capital during the years ended March 31, 2024 and 
March 31, 2023.
Note 46: Material foreseeable losses
The Company has a process whereby periodically all long term contracts (including derivative contracts) are assessed for material foreseeable 
losses. At the year end, the Company has reviewed and ensured that adequate provision as required under any law / accounting standards

Statements
Opinion
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of CEAT 
Limited (hereinafter referred to as the “Holding Company”) and 
its subsidiaries (Holding Company and its subsidiaries together 
referred to as “the Group”), its associate and its joint ventures, which 
comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 March 2024, 
and the consolidated statement of profit and loss (including other 
comprehensive income), consolidated statement of changes in 
equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then 
ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including

Accountants of India and the relevant provisions of the Act, and we 
have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with 
these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence obtained 
by us along with the consideration of reports of the other auditors 
referred to in paragraph (a) of the “Other Matters” section below, is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the 
consolidated financial statements.
Key Audit Matter
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated 
financial statements of the current period. These matters were 
addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we 
do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Key audit matter
See Note 24 to consolidated financial statements
The key audit matter
How the matter was addressed in our audit
The Group recognises revenue from the sales of products when 
control over goods is transferred to the customer based on specific 
terms and conditions of sale contracts with respective customers.
We have identified recognition of revenue on sale of products as a 
key audit matter as –
 
 revenue is a key performance indicator; and
 
 there is a presumed fraud risk of revenue being overstated 
through manipulation of the timing of transfer of control due 
to pressures to achieve performance targets as well as meeting 
external expectations.
In view of the significance of the matter we applied the following audit 
procedures in this area, among others to obtain sufficient appropriate 
audit evidence:
 
 Assessed the appropriateness of the policies in respect of revenue 
recognition by comparing with applicable accounting standards.
 
 Performed testing of design, implementation and operating 
effectiveness of the Holding Company’s general Information 
Technology (‘IT’) controls over revenue recognition and key IT 
application controls by involving our IT specialists.
 
 Performed testing of design, implementation and operating 
effectiveness of the Holding Company’s key manual controls 
around revenue recognition.
 
 Performed substantive testing (including year-end cut-off testing) 
of recognition of revenue in the correct period by selecting 
statistical samples of revenue transactions recorded during and 
at the end of the financial year.
 
 Examined the underlying documents such as sales invoices/ contracts 
and dispatch/ shipping documents for the selected transactions.
 
 Assessed manual journals posted in revenue ledger to identify 
any unusual items.
Other Information
The Holding Company’s Management and Board of Directors 
are responsible for the other information. The other information 
comprises the information included in the Holding Company's 
annual report, but does not include the financial statements 
and auditor’s reports thereon. The Holding Company's annual 
report is expected to be made available to us after the date of this 
auditor’s report.
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not 
cover the other information and we will not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, 
our responsibility is to read the other information identified above 
when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the 
other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated 
financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
When we read the Holding Company's annual report, if we conclude 
that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required 
to communicate the matter to those charged with governance 
and take necessary actions, as applicable under the relevant laws 
and regulations.
Management's and Board of Directors' Responsibilities 
for the Consolidated Financial Statements
The Holding Company’s Management and Board of Directors 
are responsible for the preparation and presentation of these 
consolidated financial statements in term of the requirements of 
the Act that give a true and fair view of the consolidated state of 
affairs, consolidated profit/ loss and other comprehensive income, 
consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated 
cash flows of the Group including its associate and joint ventures 
in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in 
India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified 
under Section 133 of the Act. The respective Management and 
Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and 
the respective Management and Board of Directors of its associate 
and joint ventures are responsible for maintenance of adequate 
accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act 
for safeguarding the assets of each company and for preventing 
and detecting frauds and other irregularities; the selection and 
application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments 
and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, 
implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial 
controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the 
accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant 
to the preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial 
statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have been 
used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial 
statements by the Management and Board of Directors of the 
Holding Company, as aforesaid.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the respective 
Management and Board of Directors of the companies included in 
the Group and the respective Management and Board of Directors 
of its associate and joint ventures are responsible for assessing the 
ability of each company to continue as a going concern, disclosing, 
as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going 
concern basis of accounting unless the respective Board of Directors 
either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or 
has no realistic alternative but to do so. 
The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the 
Group and the respective Management and Board of Directors and 
of its associate and joint ventures are responsible for overseeing the 
financial reporting process of each company.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue 
an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit 
conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or 
error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated 
financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional 
judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the 
audit. We also:
 

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the 
consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or 
error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to 
those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not 
detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is 
higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve 
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or 
the override of internal control.
 

Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the 
audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate 
in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we 
are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether 
the company has adequate internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements in place and the operating 
effectiveness of such controls.
 

Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used 
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related 
disclosures made by the Management and Board of Directors.
 

Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management and 
Board of Directors use of the going concern basis of accounting 
in preparation of consolidated financial statements and, based 
on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty 
exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant 
doubt on the appropriateness of this assumption. If we 
conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to 
draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures 
in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures 
are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are 
based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our 
auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may 
cause the Group and its associate and joint ventures to cease to 
continue as a going concern. 
 

Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the 
consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, 
232

Financial Statements
and whether the consolidated financial statements represent 
the underlying transactions and events in a manner that 
achieves fair presentation.
 

Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the 
financial statements of such entities or business activities 
within the Group and its associate and joint ventures to express 
an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are 
responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of 
the audit of the financial statements of such entities included 
in the consolidated financial statements of which we are the 
independent auditors. For the other entities included in the 
consolidated financial statements, which have been audited 
by other auditors, such other auditors remain responsible 
for the direction, supervision and performance of the audits 
carried out by them. We remain solely responsible for our 
audit opinion. Our responsibilities in this regard are further 
described in paragraph (a) of the section titled “Other Matters” 
in this audit report.
We communicate with those charged with governance of the 
Holding Company of which we are the independent auditors 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of 
the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant 
deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement 
that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding 
independence, and to communicate with them all relationships 
and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements 
of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. 
We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or 
regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in 
extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not 
be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences 
of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public 
interest benefits of such communication.
Other Matter(s)

whose financial statements reflects total assets (before 
consolidation adjustments) of H 14,126 Lakhs as at 31 March

audited by us. These financial statements have been audited by 
other auditors whose reports have been furnished to us by the 
Management and our opinion on the consolidated financial

standards applicable in their respective countries. The Holding 
Company’s management has converted the financial statements 
of such subsidiaries, joint venture and associate located outside 
India from accounting principles generally accepted in their 
respective countries to accounting principles generally accepted 
in India. We have audited these conversion adjustments made 
by the Holding Company’s management. Our opinion in so far

venture and associate located outside India is based on the reports 
of other auditors and the conversion adjustments prepared by the 
management of the Holding Company and audited by us.

to the amounts and disclosures included in respect of these 
subsidiaries, and our report in terms of sub-section (3) of Section 
143 of the Act in so far as it relates to the aforesaid subsidiaries,

Annexure B to the Independent Auditor’s Report on 
the consolidated financial statements of CEAT Limited 
for the year ended 31 March 2024
Report on the internal financial controls with reference 
to the aforesaid consolidated financial statements under 
Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Act
(Referred to in paragraph 2(A)(g) under ‘Report on Other 
Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our 
report of even date)
Opinion
In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial statements 
of CEAT Limited (hereinafter referred to as “the Holding Company”) 
as of and for the year ended 31 March 2024, we have audited the 
internal financial controls with reference to financial statements of 
the Holding Company and such companies incorporated in India 
under the Act which is its subsidiary companies, as of that date.
In our opinion, and based on the consideration of reports of the 
other auditors on internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements of subsidiary companies, as were audited 
by the other auditors the Holding Company and such companies 
incorporated in India which are its subsidiary companies,, have, 
in all material respects, adequate internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements and such internal financial controls 
were operating effectively as at 31 March 2024, based on the internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements criteria 
established by the Holding Company considering the essential 
components of such internal controls stated in the Guidance Note 
on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting 
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the 
“Guidance Note”).
Management’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities 
for Internal Financial Controls
The respective Companies Management and the Board of Directors 
are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial 
controls based on the internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements criteria established by the respective 
companies considering the essential components of internal 
control stated in the Guidance Note. These responsibilities include 
the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal 
financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the 
orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence 
to the Holding Company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, 
the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and 
completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation 
of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and 
the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under Section 143(10) of the 
Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements. Those Standards and the 
Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements 
and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements were established and maintained and if such 
controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence 
about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit 
of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements 
included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements, assessing the risk that a 
material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and 
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed 
risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, 
including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of 
the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit 
evidence obtained by the other auditors of the relevant subsidiary 
companies, in terms of their reports referred to in the Other Matters 
paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our audit opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with Reference 
to Financial Statements
A company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance 
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation 
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements include those 
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records 
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions 
and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable 
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit 
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of 
the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations 
of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide 
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of 
unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets 
that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls 
with Reference to Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements, including the possibility of 
collusion or improper management override of controls, material 
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements to future periods are subject 
to the risk that the internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements may become inadequate because of changes 
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or 
procedures may deteriorate.
Other Matters
Our aforesaid report under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on the 
adequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements insofar as it relates 
to two subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in 
India, is based on the corresponding reports of the auditors of such 
companies incorporated in India.
The internal financial controls with reference to financial statements 
insofar as it relates to two subsidiary companies, which are 
companies incorporated in India and included in these consolidated 
financial statements, have not been audited either by us or by 
other auditors. In our opinion and according to the information 
and explanations given to us by the Management, such unaudited 
components are not material to the Holding Company.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of above matters.

Note 2: Basis of preparation, measurement and material 
accounting policies
2.1	 Basis of preparation and measurement
2.1.1 Basis of preparation
	
The financial statements of the Group have been prepared in 
accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards (hereinafter 
referred to as the ‘Ind AS’) as notified by Ministry of Corporate 
Affairs pursuant to Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read 
with Rule 3 of the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 
Rules, 2015 as amended from time to time and presentation 
requirements of Division II of revised Schedule III of the 
Companies Act 2013 (Ind AS compliant Schedule III).
	
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared 
on accrual and going concern basis. The accounting policies 
are applied consistently to all the periods presented in the 
consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial 
statements are presented in “₹”, the functional currency of the 
Group. Items included in the financial statements of the Group are 
recorded using the currency of the primary economic environment 
in which the Group operates (the ‘functional currency’).
	
All amounts disclosed in the consolidated financial statements 
and notes have been rounded off to the nearest Lakhs as per 
the requirements of Schedule III of the Companies Act, 2013, 
unless otherwise stated. Wherever the amount represented ‘0’ 
(zero) construes value less than Rupees fifty thousand.
2.1.2 Basis of Measurement
	
These consolidated financial statements are prepared under 
the historical cost convention except for the following assets 
and liabilities which have been measured at fair value:
 

Derivative financial instruments and
 

Certain financial assets measured at fair value (refer 
accounting policy regarding financial instruments)
	
In addition, the carrying values of recognised assets and 
liabilities designated as hedged items in fair value hedges that 
would otherwise be carried at amortised cost are adjusted to 
record changes in the fair values attributable to the risks that 
are being hedged in effective hedge relationships.
2.2	 Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial 
statements of the Company and its subsidiaries as at March 31, 2024. 
The Group’s investment in jointly controlled entities and associate 
are accounted for using the equity method. Control is achieved 
when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from 
its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those 
returns through its power over the investee. Specifically, the Group 
controls an investee if and only if the Group has:
 

Power over the investee (i.e., existing rights that give it the 
current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee)
 

Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement 
with the investee, and
 

The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns
Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting rights 
result in control. To support this presumption and when the Group 
has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, 
the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing 
whether it has power over an investee, including:
 

The contractual arrangement with the other vote holders 
of the investee
 

Rights arising from other contractual arrangements
 

The Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights
 

	The size of the Group’s holding of voting rights relative 
to the size and dispersion of the holdings of the other 
voting rights holders
The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts 
and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of 
the three elements of control. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins 
when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases 
when the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, 
income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during 
the year are included in the consolidated financial statements from 
the date the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to 
control the subsidiary.
Consolidated financial statements are prepared using uniform 
accounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar 
circumstances. If a member of the group uses accounting policies 
other than those adopted in the consolidated financial statements 
for like transactions and events in similar circumstances, appropriate 
adjustments are made to that group member’s financial statements 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements to ensure 
conformity with the group’s accounting policies.
The financial statements of all entities used for the purpose of 
consolidation are drawn up to same reporting date as that of the 
parent company, i.e., year ended on March 31. When the end of the 
reporting period of the parent is different from that of a subsidiary, 
the subsidiary prepares, for consolidation purposes, additional 
financial information as of the same date as the financial statements 
of the parent to enable the parent to consolidate the financial 
information of the subsidiary, unless it is impracticable to do so.
Consolidation procedure:
 

Combine items like of assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses 
and cash flows of the parent with those of its subsidiaries. For 
this purpose, income and expenses of the subsidiary are based 
on the amounts of the assets and liabilities recognised in the 
consolidated financial statements at the acquisition date.
 

Offset (eliminate) the carrying amount of the parent’s 
investment in each subsidiary and the parent’s portion of equity 
of each subsidiary. Business combinations policy explains how 
to account for any related goodwill.
 

Eliminate in full intragroup assets and liabilities, equity, 
income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions 
between entities of the group (profits or losses resulting from 
intragroup transactions that are recognised in assets, such as 
inventory and fixed assets, are eliminated in full). Intragroup 
losses may indicate an impairment that requires recognition in 
the consolidated financial statements. Ind AS 12 Income Taxes 
applies to temporary differences that arise from the elimination 
of profits and losses resulting from intragroup transactions.
 

Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive 
income (OCI) are attributed to the equity holders of the parent 
of the Group and to the non-controlling interests, even if this 
results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of 
control, is accounted for as an equity transaction. If the Group loses 
control over a subsidiary, it:
 

Derecognises the assets (including goodwill) and liabilities 
of the subsidiary
 

Derecognises 
the 
carrying 
amount 
of 
any 
non-
controlling interests
 

Derecognises 
the 
cumulative 
translation 
differences 
recorded in equity
 

Recognises the fair value of the consideration received
 

Recognises the fair value of any investment retained
 

Recognises any surplus or deficit in profit or loss
 

Reclassifies the parent’s share of components previously 
recognised in OCI to profit or loss or retained earnings, as 
appropriate, as would be required if the Group had directly 
disposed of the related assets or liabilities
2.3	 Business Combination
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition 
method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate 
of the consideration transferred measured at fair value as on 
acquisition date and the amount of any non-controlling interests 
in the acquiree. For each business combination, the Group elects 
whether to measure the non-controlling interests in the acquiree at 
fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable 
net assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired, and the 
liabilities assumed are recognised at their acquisition date fair values.

for the year ended March 31, 2024
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer 
is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Contingent 
consideration classified as an asset or liability that is a financial 
instrument and within the scope of Ind AS 109 Financial Instruments, 
is measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in 
profit or loss. If the contingent consideration is not within the scope 
of Ind AS 109, it is measured in accordance with the appropriate 
Ind AS. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not 
re-measured at subsequent reporting dates and subsequently its 
settlement is accounted for within equity.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the 
aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount 
recognised for non-controlling interests, and any previous interest 
held, over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. 
Any gain on a bargain purchase is recognised in other comprehensive 
income and accumulated in equity as capital reserve if there exists 
clear evidence, of the underlying reasons for classifying the business 
combination as resulting in a bargain purchase; otherwise the gain 
is recognised in equity as capital reserve.
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any 
accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment 
testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the 
acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating 
units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective 
of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned 
to those units.
A cash generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is 
tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there 
is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable 
amount of the cash generating unit is less than its carrying amount, 
the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount 
of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets 
of the unit pro rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in 
the unit. Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognised in profit or 
loss. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in 
subsequent periods.
Where goodwill has been allocated to a cash-generating unit and 
part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill 
associated with the disposed operation is included in the carrying 
amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on 
disposal. Goodwill disposed in these circumstances is measured 
based on the relative values of the disposed operation and the 
portion of the cash-generating unit retained.
2.4  Investment in joint venture and associate
A joint venture is a type of joint arrangement whereby the parties 
that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net 
assets of the joint venture. Joint control is the contractually agreed 
sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when 
decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent 
of the parties sharing control.
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant 
influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the 
financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not 
control or joint control over those policies.
The considerations made in determining whether joint control are 
similar to those necessary to determine control over the subsidiaries.
The Group’s investments in joint venture and associate are 
accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method, 
the investment in a joint venture or associate is initially recognised 
at cost. The carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to 
recognise changes in the Group’s share of net assets of joint venture 
or associate since the acquisition date. Goodwill relating to joint 
venture or associate is included in the carrying amount of the 
investment and is not tested for impairment individually.
The consolidated statement of profit and loss reflects the Group’s 
share of the results of operations of joint venture and associate. Any 
change in OCI of those investees is presented as part of the Group’s 
OCI. In addition, when there has been a change recognised directly 
in the equity of joint venture or associate, the Group recognises its 
share of any changes, when applicable, in the statement of changes 
in equity. Unrealised gains and losses resulting from transactions 
between the Group and joint venture or associate are eliminated to 
the extent of the interest in joint venture or associate.
The aggregate of the Group’s share of profit or loss of a joint venture 
and associate is shown on the face of the consolidated statement of 
profit and loss.
The financial statements of joint venture and associate are prepared 
for the same reporting period as the Group. When necessary, 
adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies in line with 
those of the Group.
After application of the equity method, the Group determines 
whether it is necessary to recognise an impairment loss on its 
investment in its joint venture or associate. At each reporting date, 
the Group determines whether there is objective evidence that 
the investment in joint venture or associate is impaired. If there is 
such evidence, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as 
the difference between the recoverable amount of joint venture 
or associate and its carrying value, and then recognises the loss as 
‘Share of profit of a joint venture and associate’ in the statement of 
profit or loss.
2.5	 Current versus non-current classification
The Group presents assets and liabilities in the Balance Sheet 
based on current/ non-current classification. An asset is treated as 
current when it is:
 

Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in 
normal operating cycle
 

Held primarily for the purpose of trading
 

Expected to be realised within twelve months after the 
reporting period, or
 

 Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged 
or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the 
reporting period
All other assets are classified as non-current. 
A liability is current when:
 

It is expected to be settled in normal operating cycle
 

It is held primarily for the purpose of trading
 

It is due to be settled within twelve months after the 
reporting period, or
 

There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the 
liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period
The Group classifies all other liabilities as non-current.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets 
and liabilities.
The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition of assets for 
processing and their realisation in cash and cash equivalents. The 
Group has identified twelve months as its operating cycle.
2.6	 Revenue from operation & other income
2.6.1 Revenue from contracts with customers
	
Revenues from contracts with customers are when the 
performance obligations towards customer have been met. 
Performance obligations are deemed to have been met when 
control of the goods or services are transferred to the customer 
at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the 
Group expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or 
services. The Group acts as the principle in all of its revenue 
arrangements since it is the primary obligor in all the revenue 
arrangements as it has pricing latitude and is also exposed to 
inventory and credit risks.
	
An entity collects Goods and Services Tax (‘GST’) on behalf 
of the government and not on its own account. Hence it is 
excluded from revenue, i.e. Revenue is net of GST.
2.6.2 Sale of Goods:
	
Revenue from sale of goods (Tyres, tubes and flaps) is 
recognised at the point of time when control of the goods is 
transferred to customer depending on terms of sales.
	
The Group considers whether there are other promises in the 
contract that are separate performance obligations to which 
a portion of the transaction price needs to be allocated (e.g. 
Sales related obligations). In determining the transaction 
price for the sale of goods, the Group considers the effects of 
variable consideration, the existence of significant financing 
components, if any.
2.6.3 Variable consideration
	
Variable consideration includes various forms of discounts 
like volume discounts, price concessions, incentives, etc. on 
the goods sold to its dealers and distributors. In all such cases, 
accumulated experience is used to estimate and provide for 
the variability in revenue, using the expected value method 
and the revenue is recognised to the extent that it is highly 
probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative 
revenue recognised will not occur in future on account of 
refund or discounts.
2.6.4 Significant financing component
	
Generally, the Group receives short-term advances from its 
customers. Using the practical expedient in Ind AS 115, the 
Group does not adjust the promised amount of consideration 
for the effects of a significant financing component if it expects, 
at contract inception, that the period between the transfer of 
the promised good or service to the customer and when the 
customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less.
2.6.5 Contract balances- Trade receivables
	
A receivable represents the Group’s right to an amount of 
consideration that is unconditional (i.e., only the passage of 
time is required before payment of the consideration is due). 
Refer to note 2.17 Financial Instruments in accounting policies.
2.7	 Government grants, subsidies and export incentives
Government grants / subsidies are recognised in statement of profit 
and loss as per income approach when there is reasonable assurance 
that the Group will comply with all the conditions attached to them 
and that the grant / subsidy will be received.
The Company has determined that reasonable assurance is 
established upon receipt of sanction letter approving the incentive 
amount in accordance with the respective State Industrial 
Promotion Subsidy.
The Group has chosen to adjust grant under the Export Promotion 
Capital Goods (‘EPCG’) scheme from the carrying value of non-
monetary asset pursuant to amendment in Ind AS 20.
Export Incentive under Merchandise Export from India Scheme 
(‘MEIS’) is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and 
loss as a part of other operating revenues on receipt basis.
2.8	 Taxes
2.8.1 Current tax
	
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount 
expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation 
authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the 
amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted, 
at the reporting date in India where the Group operates and 
generates taxable income.
	
Current tax relating to items recognised outside the 
consolidated statement of profit and loss is either in Other 
Comprehensive Income (‘OCI’) or in equity. Current tax items 
are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction 
either in consolidated statement of profit and loss or directly 
in equity. Management periodically evaluates positions taken 
in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable 
tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes 
provisions where appropriate.
	
Interest expenses and penalties, if any, related to income tax 
are included in finance cost and other expenses respectively. 
Interest Income, if any, related to income tax is included 
in Other Income.

Uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of complex 
tax regulations and the amount and timing of future taxable 
income. Given the wide range of business relationships and 
the long-term nature and complexity of existing contractual 
agreements, differences arising between the actual results and 
the assumptions made, or future changes to such assumptions, 
could necessitate future adjustments to tax income and 
expense already recorded. The Group establishes provisions, 
based on reasonable estimates, for possible consequences 
of audits by the tax authorities of the respective countries 
in which it operates. The amount of such provisions is based 
on various factors, such as experience of previous tax audits 
and differing interpretations of tax regulations by the taxable 
entity and the responsible tax authority. Such differences of 
interpretation may arise on a wide variety of issues depending 
on the conditions prevailing in the Group’s domicile.
2.8.2 Deferred tax
	
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences 
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts for financial reporting purposes at the reporting date.
	
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary 
differences, except:
 

When the deferred tax liability arises from the initial 
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that 
is not a business combination and, at the time of the 
transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor 
taxable profit and loss.
 

In respect of taxable temporary differences associated 
with investments in subsidiaries and interests in 
joint ventures, when the timing of the reversal of the 
temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable 
that the temporary differences will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future.
	
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary 
differences, the carry forward of unused tax credits and any 
unused tax losses. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the 
extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available 
against which the deductible temporary differences, and the 
carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can 
be utilised, except:
 

When the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible 
temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of 
an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business 
combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects 
neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit and loss.
 

In respect of deductible temporary differences associated 
with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests 
in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are recognised only to 
the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences 
will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit 
will be available against which the temporary differences 
can be utilised.
	
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each 
reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow 
all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised 
deferred tax assets are re-assessed at each reporting date and are 
recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future 
taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax 
rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is 
realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax 
laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the 
reporting date.
	
Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside consolidated 
statement of profit and loss is recognised either in OCI or in 
equity. Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation to the 
underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity.
	
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a 
legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets 
against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to 
the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
2.9	 Non-current assets held for sale
The Group classifies Non-current assets or disposal groups 
comprising of assets and liabilities are classified as ‘held for sale’ 
when all of the following criteria are met
 

Decision has been made to sell;
 

The assets are available for immediate sale in its 
present condition;
 

The assets are being actively marketed; and,
 

Sale has been agreed or is expected to be concluded within 12 
months of the Balance Sheet date.
Subsequently, such non-current assets and disposal groups 
classified as ‘held for sale’ are measured at the lower of it carrying 
value and fair value less costs to sell. Non-current assets held for sale 
are not depreciated or amortised.
2.10 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of 
accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, 
if any. Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of the plant 
and equipment and borrowing costs for long-term construction 
projects if the recognition criteria are met. When significant parts 
of plant and equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the 
Group depreciates them separately based on their specific useful 
lives. Likewise, when a major inspection is performed, its cost is 
recognised in the carrying amount of the plant and equipment as a 
replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied. All other repair 
and maintenance costs are recognised in the consolidated statement 
of profit and loss as incurred. The present value of the expected cost 
for the decommissioning of an asset after its use is included in the 
cost of the respective asset if the recognition criteria for a provision 
are met. Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only if it is probable 
that the future economic benefits associated with the expenditure 
will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured 
reliably. The cost of property, plant and equipment at 1 April 2015, 
the company’s date of transition to Ind AS, was determined with 
reference to its carrying value recognised as per the previous GAAP 
(deemed cost), as at the date of transition to Ind AS.
An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant 
part initially recognised is derecognised upon disposal or when 
no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. 
Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as 
the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset) is included in the consolidated statement of 
profit and loss when the asset is derecognised.
Property, plant and equipment which are not ready for intended 
use as on the date of Balance Sheet are disclosed as “Capital 
work-in-progress”.
Advances paid towards the acquisition of property, plant and 
equipment outstanding at each Balance Sheet date is classified as 
capital advances under “Other non-current assets”.
Depreciation is provided on a pro-rata basis on the straight-line 
method based on useful life estimated by the management and 
supported by independent assessment by professionals which may 
not be necessarily in the alignment with the useful lives prescribed 
by schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013. Depreciation commences 
when the asset is ready for its intended use. The Group has used the 
following useful lives to provide depreciation on its fixed assets.
Asset Class
Useful life
Freehold land
Non depreciable
Leasehold land
Lease term – 95 years
Buildings (including temporary structures)
1 year - 60 years
Plant & Equipment
1 year - 20 years
Furniture & Fixture
1 year - 10 years
Vehicle
1 year - 8 years
Office Equipment
1 Year- 5 years
The identified components are depreciated over their useful lives, 
the remaining asset is depreciated over the life of the principal asset.
The management believes that the depreciation rates fairly reflect its 
estimation of the useful lives and residual values of the fixed assets.
The residual values, useful life and methods of depreciation of 
property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each financial year 
end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.
2.11 Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial 
recognition at cost. Following initial recognition, intangible 
assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and 
accumulated impairment losses.
Internally generated intangibles, excluding capitalised development 
costs, are not capitalised and the related expenditure is reflected 
in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which the 
expenditure is incurred. Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only 
if it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with 
the expenditure will flow to the Company and the cost of the item 
can be measured reliably. The cost of intangible assets at 1 April 
2015, the Company’s date of transition to Ind AS, was determined 
with reference to its carrying value recognised as per the previous 
GAAP (deemed cost), as at the date of transition to Ind AS.
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful 
economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is 
an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The 
amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is 
recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss unless 
such expenditure forms part of carrying value of another asset.
Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible 
asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised 
in the consolidated statement of profit and loss when the asset 
is derecognised.
Intangible assets are amortised on a pro-rata basis on the straight-line 
method based on useful life estimated by the management as under:
Asset Class
Useful life
Software
1 Year – 6 years
Brand (refer 2.11.1)
20 years
Technical know-how (refer 2.11.1)

2.11.1 Technical know-how and Brand
	
Technical know-how: The Group has originally generated 
technical know-how and assistance from International Tire 
Engineering Resources LLC, for setting up of Halol radial plant. 
Considering the life of the underlying plant / facility, this 
technical know-how, is amortised on a straight-line basis over a 
period of twenty years.
	
Brand: The Group has acquired global rights of “CEAT” brand 
from the Italian tyre maker, Pirelli. Prior to the said acquisition, 
the Group was the owner of the brand in only a few Asian 
countries including India. With the acquisition of the brand 
which is renowned worldwide, new and hitherto unexplored 
markets will be accessible to the Group. The Group will be 
in a position to fully exploit the export market resulting in 
increased volume and better price realisation. Therefore, the 
management believes that the Brand will yield significant 
benefits for a period of at least twenty years.
2.11.2 Research and development costs (Product development)
	
Research costs are charged to P&L as and when they are 
incurred. Development expenditures on an individual project 
are recognised as an intangible asset when the Group 
can demonstrate:
 

The technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset 
so that the asset will be available for use or sale.
 

Its intention to complete and its ability and intention to 
use or sell the asset.
 

How the asset will generate future economic benefits.
 

The availability of resources to complete the asset.
 

The ability to measure reliably the expenditure 
during development.

The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an 
intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least 
at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the expected 
useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future 
economic benefits embodied in the asset are considered to 
modify the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and 
are treated as changes in accounting estimates.
2.12 Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction 
or production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period 
of time to get ready for its intended use or sale (‘qualifying asset’) are 
capitalised as part of the cost of the asset. All other borrowing costs 
are expensed in the period in which they occur. Borrowing costs 
consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection 
with the borrowing of funds. Borrowing cost also includes exchange 
differences to the extent regarded as an adjustment to the 
borrowing costs.
To the extent that the Group borrows funds specifically for the 
purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset, the Group determines 
the amount of borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation as the 
actual borrowing costs incurred on that borrowing during the 
period less any investment income on the temporary investment of 
those borrowings.
To the extent that the Group borrows funds generally and uses 
them for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset, the Group 
determines the amount of borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation 
by applying a capitalisation rate to the expenditures on that asset. 
The capitalisation rate is the weighted average of the borrowing 
costs applicable to the borrowings of the Group that are outstanding 
during the period, other than borrowings made specifically for the 
purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset.
2.13 Leases
The Group has entered into various arrangements like lease of 
premises and outsourcing arrangements which has been disclosed 
accordingly under Ind AS 116. At inception of a contract, the Group 
assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or 
contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of 
an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. 
The assessment of whether a contract conveys the right to control 
the use of an identified asset depends on whether the Group obtains 
substantially all the economic benefits from the use of the asset and 
whether the Group has the right to direct the use of the asset.
Group as a lessee:
The Group applies a single recognition and measurement approach 
for all leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low-
value assets. The Group recognises lease liabilities to make lease 
payments and right-of-use assets representing the right to use the 
underlying assets.
2.13.1 Right-of-use assets
	
The Group recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement 
date of the lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available 
for use). The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount 
of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and 
lease payments made at or before the commencement date less 
any lease incentives received. Right-of-use assets are measured 
at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment 
losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. 
Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over 
shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the 
underlying asset as follows:
Asset Class
Useful life
Building
1 – 11 years
Land
95 Years
Others  
(includes buildings &  
Plant & machinery)
2 – 10 years
	
If ownership of the leased asset transfers to the Group at the 
end of the lease term or the cost reflects the exercise of a 
purchase option, depreciation is calculated using the estimated 
useful life of the asset. The Group presents right-of-use assets 
separately in the Balance Sheet.
	
In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced 
by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain 
remeasurements of the lease liability. When the lease liability 
is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made 
to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset or is recorded 
in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset 
has been reduced to zero.
2.13.2 Lease liabilities
	
At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises 
lease liabilities measured at the present value of future lease 
payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments 
include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) 
less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments 
that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to 
be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments 
also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably 
certain to be exercised by the Group and payments of penalties 
for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group 
exercising the option to terminate. Variable lease payments 
that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as 
expenses (unless the cost is included in the carrying value of 
inventories) in the period in which the event or condition that 
triggers the payment occurs.
	
In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group 
uses its incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement 
date because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily 
determinable. After the commencement date, the amount of 
lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest 
and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the 
carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is 
a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the 
lease payments (e.g., changes to future payments resulting 
from a change in an index or rate used to determine such 
lease payments) or a change in the assessment of an option to 
purchase the underlying asset.
	
The Group’s lease liabilities are included in current and non-
current financial liabilities. Lease liability has been separately 
presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments have been 
classified as financing cash flows.
2.13.3 Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets
	
The Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption 
to the contracts which have a lease term of 12 months or less 
from the date of commencement date and do not contain 
a purchase option. It also applies the lease of low-value 
assets recognition exemption to the lease contracts that are 
considered to be low value.
 	
Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value 
assets are recognised as expense on a straight-line basis over 
the lease term.
2.14 Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value 
on item by item basis.
The cost of inventories includes expenditure incurred in acquiring 
the inventories, production or conversion costs and other costs 
incurred in bringing them to their present location and condition. 
Cost is determined on a weighted average basis.
 

Cost of raw materials includes the transfer of gains and losses 
on qualifying cash flow hedges, recognised in OCI, in respect of 
the purchases of raw materials. Raw materials and other items 
held for use in the production of inventories are not written 
down below cost if the finished products in which they will be 
incorporated are expected to be sold at or above cost.
 

Work-in-progress and finished goods includes direct materials, 
labour and a proportion of manufacturing overheads based on 
normal operating capacity but excluding borrowing cost.
 

Traded goods and stores & spares include cost of purchase and 
other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present 
location and condition.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary 
course of business, less estimated costs of completion and the 
estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
2.15 Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation 
(legal or constructive) as a result of a past event and it is probable 
that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be 
required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made 
of the amount of the obligation. When the Group expects some or 
all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example, under an insurance 
contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset, but 
only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense 
relating to a provision is presented in the consolidated statement of 
profit and loss net of any reimbursement.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions 
are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when 
appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is 
used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is 
recognised as a finance cost.
2.15.1 Sales related obligations
	
The estimated liability for sales related obligations is recorded 
when products are sold. These estimates are established using 
historical information on the nature, frequency and average cost 
of obligations and management estimates regarding possible 
future incidence based on corrective actions on product failure. 
The timing of outflows will vary as and when the obligation 
will arise - being typically up to three years. Initial recognition 
is based on historical experience. The initial estimate of sales 
related obligations (related costs) are revised annually.
2.15.2 Decommissioning liability
	
The Group records a provision for decommissioning costs of 
land taken on lease at one of the manufacturing facility for 
the production of tyres. Decommissioning costs are provided 
at the present value of expected costs to settle the obligation 
using estimated cash flows and are recognised as part of the 
cost of the particular asset. The cash flows are discounted 
at a current pre-tax rate that reflects the risks specific to the 
decommissioning liability. The unwinding of the discount 
is expensed as incurred and recognised in the consolidated 
statement of profit and loss as a finance cost. The estimated 
future costs of decommissioning are reviewed annually and 
adjusted as appropriate. Changes in the estimated future costs 
or in the discount rate applied are added to or deducted from 
the cost of the asset.
2.15.3 Litigations
	
The Group is party to various lawsuits that are at administrative 
or judicial level or in their initial stages, involving tax and civil 
matters. The Group contests all claims in the court / tribunals 
/ appellate authority levels and based on their assessment 
and that of their legal counsel, records a provision when the 
risk or loss is considered probable. The outflow is expected on 
cessations of the respective events.
2.16 Employee benefits
2.16.1 Defined contribution plan
	
Retirement benefit in the form of Provident Fund, 
Superannuation, Employees State Insurance Contribution 
and Labour Welfare fund are defined contribution scheme. 
The Group has no obligation, other than the contribution 
payable to the above mentioned funds. The Group recognises 
contribution payable to these funds / schemes as an expense, 
when an employee renders the related service. If the 
contribution payable to the scheme for service received before 
the Balance Sheet date exceeds the contribution already paid, 
the deficit payable is recognised as a liability after deducting 
the contribution already paid. If the contribution already paid

exceeds the contribution due for services received before the 
Balance Sheet date, then excess is recognised as an asset to 
the extent that the pre-payment will lead to, for example, a 
reduction in future payment or a cash refund.
2.16.2 Defined benefit plan
	
For defined benefit plans, the amount recognised as ‘Employee 
benefit expenses’ in the consolidated statement of profit and 
loss is the cost of accruing employee benefits promised to 
employees over the year and the costs of individual events 
such as past / future service benefit changes and settlements 
(such events are recognised immediately in the consolidated 
statement of profit and loss). The amount of net interest 
expense calculated by applying the liability discount rate to the 
net defined benefit liability or asset is charged or credited to 
‘Finance costs’ in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. 
Any differences between the expected interest income on plan 
assets and the return actually achieved, and any changes in the 
liabilities over the year due to changes in actuarial assumptions 
or experience adjustments within the plans, are recognised 
immediately in OCI and subsequently not reclassified to the 
consolidated statement of profit and loss.
	
The defined benefit plan surplus or deficit on the Balance 
Sheet date comprises fair value of plan assets less the present 
value of the defined benefit liabilities using a discount rate by 
reference to market yields on Government bonds at the end of 
the reporting period.
	
All defined benefit plans obligations are determined 
based on valuations, as at the Balance Sheet date, made by 
independent actuary using the projected unit credit method. 
The classification of the Group’s net obligation into current and 
non-current is as per the actuarial valuation report.
	
When the benefits of a plan are changed or when a plan is 
curtailed, the resulting change in benefit that relates to past 
service (‘past service cost’ or ‘past service gain’) or the gain or 
loss on curtailment is recognised immediately in profit or loss. 
The Group recognizes gains and losses on the settlement of a 
defined benefit plan when the settlement occurs.
2.16.3 Termination benefits
	
Termination benefits, in the nature of voluntary retirement 
benefits or termination benefits arising from restructuring are 
recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. 
The Group recognises termination benefits at the earlier of the 
following dates:
 

When the Group can no longer withdraw the offer of 
those benefits; or
 

 When the Group recognises costs for a restructuring that 
is within the scope of Ind AS 37: Provisions, Contingent 
Liabilities and Contingent Assets and involves the 
payment of termination benefits.
	
Benefits falling due more than 12 months after the end of the 
reporting period are discounted to their present value.
2.17 Financial instruments
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial 
asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of 
another entity.
2.17.1 Financial assets
	
Financial assets are recognised when the Group becomes a 
party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
	
2.17.1.1 Initial recognition and measurement
	
	
On initial recognition, a financial asset is recognised at 
fair value. In case of financial assets which are recognised 
at fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL) except for 
trade receivables without financing component which 
are measured at transaction price, its transaction cost is 
recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and 
loss. In other cases, the transaction cost is attributed to the 
acquisition value of the financial asset.
	
2.17.1.2 Subsequent measurement
	
	
For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets 
are classified in two categories:
	
	
2.17.1.2.1 Debt instruments at amortised cost
	
	
2.17.1.2.2 Equity instruments measured at FVTOCI
	
	
2.17.1.2.1 Debt instruments at amortised cost
	
	
	
A debt instrument is measured at the amortised cost 
if both the following conditions are met:
 

The asset is held within a business model 
whose objective is to hold assets for collecting 
contractual cash flows; and
 

Contractual terms of the asset give rise on 
specified dates to cash flows that are Solely 
Payments of Principal and Interest (‘SPPI’) on the 
principal amount outstanding.
	
	
	
After initial measurement, such financial assets are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
EIR method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking 
into account any discount or premium on acquisition 
and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. 
The EIR amortisation is included in finance income 
in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. 
The losses arising from impairment are recognised 
in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. 
This category generally applies to trade and other 
receivables, loans and other financial assets.
	
	
2.17.1.2.2 Equity instruments
	
	
	
All investments in equity instruments within 
the scope of Ind AS 109 are initially measured at 
fair value. Equity instruments which are held for 
trading are classified as FVTPL. For all other equity 
instruments, the Group may make an irrevocable 
election to present in the OCI subsequent changes in 
the fair value. The Group makes such election on an 
instrument-by-instrument basis. The classification is 
made on initial recognition and is irrevocable.
	
	
	
In case of equity instrument classified as FVTOCI, 
all fair value changes on the instrument, excluding 
dividends, are recognised in the OCI. There is no 
recycling of the amounts from OCI to the consolidated 
statement of profit and loss, even on derecognition 
of investment. However, the Group may transfer the 
cumulative gain or loss within equity.
	
	
	
Equity instruments included within the FVTPL 
category are measured at fair value with all changes 
recognised in the consolidated statement of 
profit and loss.
	
2.17.1.3 Derecognition
	
	
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial 
asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is 
primarily derecognised when:
 

The rights to receive cash flows from the asset 
have expired or
 

The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash 
flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation 
to pay the received cash flows in full without 
material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ 
arrangement; and either (a) the Group has transferred 
substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or 
(b) the Group has neither transferred nor retained 
substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but 
has transferred control of the asset.
	
	
When the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash 
flows from an asset or has entered into a pass- through 
arrangement, it evaluates if and to what extent it has 
retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has 
neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the 
risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of 
the asset, the Group continues to recognise the transferred 
asset to the extent of the Group’s continuing involvement. 
In that case, the Group also recognises an associated 
liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability 
are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and 
obligations that the Group has retained.
	
	
Continuing involvement that takes the form of a 
guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the 
lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the 
maximum amount of consideration that the Group could 
be required to repay.
	
2.17.1.4 Impairment of financial assets
	
	
In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Group applies Expected 
Credit Loss (‘ECL’) model for measurement and recognition 
of impairment loss on the following financial assets and 
credit risk exposure:
	
	
(i)	
Trade receivables
	
	
(ii)	 Financial assets measured at amortised cost (other 
than trade receivables)
	
	
(iii)	 Financial assets measured at fair value through other 
comprehensive income (FVTOCI).
	
	
The Group follows ‘simplified approach’ for recognition 
of impairment loss allowance on trade receivables. The 
application of simplified approach does not require the 
Group to track changes in credit risk. Rather, it recognises 
impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each 
reporting date, right from its initial recognition.
	
	
For recognition of impairment loss on other financial 
assets [i.e. (ii) and (iii) above] and risk exposure, the Group 
determines that whether there has been a significant 
increase in the credit risk since initial recognition. If 
credit risk has not increased significantly, 12 month ECL 
is used to provide for impairment loss. However, if credit 
risk has increased significantly, lifetime ECL is used. If, in 
a subsequent period, credit quality of the instrument 
improves such that there is no longer a significant increase 
in credit risk since initial recognition, then the entity 
reverts to recognising impairment loss allowance based 
on 12-month ECL.
	
	
Lifetime ECL are the expected credit losses resulting 
from all possible default events over the expected life of 
a financial instrument. The 12 month ECL is a portion of 
the lifetime ECL which results from default events that are 
possible within 12 months after the reporting date.
	
	
ECL is the difference between all contractual cash flows 
that are due to the Group in accordance with the contract 
and all the cash flows that the entity expects to receive (i.e. 
all cash shortfalls), discounted at the original EIR. When 
estimating the cash flows, an entity is required to consider:
 

All contractual terms of the financial instrument 
(including prepayment, extension, call and similar 
options) over the expected life of the financial 
instrument. However, in rare cases when the 
expected life of the financial instrument cannot 
be estimated reliably, then the entity is required 
to use the remaining contractual term of the 
financial instrument
 

Cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other 
credit enhancements that are integral to the 
contractual terms
	
	
As a practical expedient, the Group uses a provision matrix 
to determine impairment loss allowance on portfolio 
of its trade receivables. The provision matrix is based on 
its historically observed default rates over the expected 
life of the trade receivables and is adjusted for forward-
looking estimates. At every reporting date, the historical 
observed default rates and changes in the forward-
looking estimates are updated. For assessing increase 
in credit risk and impairment loss, the Group combines 
financial instruments on the basis of shared credit risk 
characteristics with the objective of facilitating an analysis 
that is designed to enable significant increases in credit 
risk to be identified on a timely basis.

ECL impairment loss allowance (or reversal) recognised 
during the period is recognised as income / expense 
in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. This 
amount is reflected under the head ‘other expenses’ in the 
consolidated statement of profit and loss.
	
	
The Balance Sheet presentation for various financial 
instruments is described below:
 

Financial assets measured at amortised cost and 
contractual revenue receivables: ECL is presented 
as an allowance, i.e. as an integral part of the 
measurement of those assets in the Balance Sheet. 
The allowance reduces the net carrying amount. Until 
the asset meets write-off criteria, the Group does 
not reduce impairment allowance from the gross 
carrying amount.
	
	
The Group does not have any purchased or originated 
credit-impaired financial assets, i.e., financial assets which 
are credit impaired on purchase / origination.
2.17.2 Financial liabilities
	
2.17.2.1 Initial recognition and measurement
	
	
Financial liabilities are recognised when the Group 
becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the 
instrument. All financial liabilities are recognised initially 
at fair value and in the case of borrowings net of directly 
attributable transaction costs.
	
2.17.2.2 Subsequent measurement
	
	
The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their 
classification, as described below:
	
	
2.17.2.2.1 Financial liabilities at amortised cost
	
	
	
This is the category most relevant to the Group. 
After initial recognition, financial liabilities are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
EIR method. Gains and losses are recognised in the 
consolidated statement of profit and loss when the 
liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR 
amortisation process.
 	
	
	
Amortised cost is calculated by considering any 
discount or premium on acquisition and fees or 
costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR 
amortisation is included as finance costs in the 
consolidated statement of profit and loss.
	
2.17.2.3 Derecognition
	
	
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation 
under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. 
When an existing financial liability is replaced by another 
from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the 
terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such 
an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition 
of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. 
The difference in the respective carrying amounts is 
recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.
2.17.3 Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
	
The Group uses derivative financial instruments, such as 
forward currency contracts, to manage its foreign currency 
risks. These derivative instruments are designated as cash 
flow, fair value or net investment hedges and are entered into 
for period consistent with currency. Such derivative financial 
instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on 
which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as financial 
assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities 
when the fair value is negative. Any gains or losses arising from 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are taken directly to the 
consolidated statement of profit and loss.
	
2.17.3.1 Cash flow hedges
	
	
The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument is recognised in OCI in the cash flow hedge 
reserve, while any ineffective portion is recognised 
immediately in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
	
	
The Group uses forward currency contracts as hedges of its 
exposure to foreign currency risk in forecast transactions 
and firm commitments. The ineffective portion relating 
to foreign currency contracts is recognised in the 
consolidated statement of profit and loss.
	
	
Amounts recognised as OCI are transferred to the 
consolidated statement of profit and loss when the hedged 
transaction affects profit and loss, i.e. when the hedged 
financial income or financial expense is recognised or 
when a forecast sale occurs. When the hedged item is the 
cost of a non-financial asset or non-financial liability, the 
amounts recognised as OCI are transferred to the initial 
carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability.
	
	
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated 
or exercised without replacement or rollover (as part of 
the hedging strategy), or if its designation as a hedge 
is revoked, or when the hedge no longer meets the 
criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or 
loss previously recognised in OCI remains separately in 
equity until the forecast transaction occurs or the foreign 
currency firm commitment is met.
2.17.4 Fair value measurement
	
The Group measures derivatives instruments like forward 
contracts at fair value at each Balance Sheet date.
	
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset 
or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between 
market participants at the measurement date. The fair value 
measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction 
to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:
 

In the principal market for the asset or liability or
 

In the absence of a principal market, in the most 
advantageous market for the asset or liability
	
The principal or the most advantageous market must be 
accessible by the Group.
	
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the 
assumptions that market participants would use when pricing 
the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in 
their economic best interest.
	
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into 
account a market participant’s ability to generate economic 
benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by 
selling it to another market participant that would use the asset 
in its highest and best use.
	
The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in 
the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to 
measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable 
inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs
	
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured 
or disclosed in the consolidated financial statements are 
categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as 
follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the 
fair value measurement as a whole:
 

Level 1: Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active 
markets for identical assets or liabilities.
 

Level 2: Valuation techniques for which the lowest level 
input that is significant to the fair value measurement is 
directly or indirectly observable
 

Level 3: Valuation techniques for which the lowest level 
input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
is unobservable.
	
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the consolidated 
financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines 
whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy 
by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input 
that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at 
the end of each reporting period.
	
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has 
determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the 
nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the 
level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above.
2.17.5 Offsetting of financial instruments
	
Financial assets and financial liabilities can be offset and the net 
amount is reported in the Balance Sheet if there is a currently 
enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and 
there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets 
and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
2.18 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalent in the Balance Sheet comprises cash at 
banks and on hand. For the purpose of cash flow statement, Cash 
& Cash equivalent consists of cash & short term deposits as defined 
above. The Cash flow statement is prepared using indirect method.
2.19 Dividend distribution to equity shareholders
The Group recognises a liability to pay dividend to equity 
shareholders of the Group when the distribution is authorised, and 
the distribution is no longer at the discretion of the Group. As per 
the corporate laws in India, a distribution is authorised when it is 
approved by the shareholders.
2.20 Foreign currencies
The Group’s financial statements are presented in ₹, which is also the 
Group’s functional currency.
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the Group 
at ₹ spot rate at the date the transaction first qualifies for recognition. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
are translated at the functional currency spot rates of exchange at 
the reporting date.
Exchange differences arising on settlement or translation of 
monetary items are recognised in the consolidated statement of 
profit and loss.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost 
in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the 
dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at 
fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange 
rates at the date when the fair value is determined. The gain or 
loss arising on translation of non-monetary items measured at fair 
value is treated in line with the recognition of the gain or loss on the 
change in fair value of the item (i.e., translation differences on items 
whose fair value gain or loss is recognised in OCI or profit and loss 
are also recognised in OCI or the consolidated statement of profit 
and loss, respectively).
2.21Earnings Per Share (‘EPS’)
Basic EPS amounts are calculated by dividing the profit for the year 
attributable to equity holders of the Group by the weighted average 
number of equity shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted EPS amounts are calculated by dividing the profit 
attributable to equity holders of the Group after adjusting impact 
of dilution shares by the weighted average number of equity shares 
outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of 
equity shares that would be issued on conversion of all the dilutive 
potential equity shares into equity shares.
2.22 Segment Reporting
The Executive Management Committee evaluates the Group's 
performance and allocates the resources based on an analysis of 
various performance indicators by business segments.
The Group prepares its segment information in conformity with 
the accounting policies adopted for preparing and presenting the 
financial statements of the Group as a whole.
2.23 Contingent liabilities and assets
A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past 
events whose existence will be confirmed by the occurrence or 
non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly 
within the control of the Group or a present obligation that is not 
recognised because it is not probable that an outflow of resources

will be required to settle the obligation. A contingent liability also 
arises in extremely rare cases where there is a liability that cannot be 
recognised because it cannot be measured reliably. The Group does 
not recognise a contingent liability but discloses its existence in the 
consolidated financial statements.
2.24 Significant accounting judgments, estimates and 
assumptions
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires 
management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that 
affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and 
liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures, and the disclosure 
of contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these assumptions and 
estimates could result in outcomes that require an adjustment to the 
carrying amount of assets or liabilities in future periods. Difference 
between actual results and estimates are recognised in the periods 
in which the results are known / materialised.
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of 
estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a significant 
risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are described 
below. The Group has based its assumptions and estimates on 
parameters available when the consolidated financial statements 
were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about 
future developments, however, may change due to market changes 
or circumstances arising that are beyond the control of the Group. 
Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.
Information about critical judgments in applying accounting 
policies, as well as estimates and assumptions that have the most 
significant effect to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
within the next financial year, are included in the following notes:
(a)	 Measurement of defined benefit obligations – Note 42
(b)	 Measurement and likelihood of occurrence of provisions and 
contingencies – Note 22
(c)	 Recognition of current tax and deferred tax assets – Note 23
(d)	 Key assumptions used in fair valuations – Note 48
(e)	 Measurement of lease liabilities and right-of-use asset – Note 4

The capacity expansions undertaken is modular in nature, wherein civil work and major upstream capex are incurred, followed by 
downstream capex to ramp up production in line with anticipated market demand. Based on long term demand and supply planning, 
management estimates the annual capex requirement and project timelines which are approved by the Board. There are no projects which 
are overdue based on such timelines or which have exceeded cost compared to plans.

Significant Judgements in determining the lease term of contracts with renewal and termination options: 
	
The Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to 
extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably 
certain not to be exercised.
	
The Group has several lease contracts that include extension and termination options. The Group applies judgement in evaluating 
whether it is reasonably certain whether or not to exercise the option to renew or terminate the lease. That is, it considers all relevant 
factors that create an economic incentive for it to exercise either the renewal or termination. After the commencement date, the Group 
reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that is within its control and affects its ability to 
exercise or not to exercise the option to renew or to terminate.
	
The Group included the renewal period as part of the lease term for leases of buildings and other with shorter non-cancellable period. 
The Group typically exercises its option to renew for these leases because there will be a significant negative effect on the operations if 
a replacement asset is not readily available. The renewal periods for leases of building and others with longer non-cancellable periods 
are not included as part of the lease term as these are not reasonably certain to be exercised. Furthermore, the periods covered by 
termination options are included as part of the lease term only when they are reasonably certain not to be exercised.
d) 	 The Group has lease contracts for plant & machinery that contains variable payments amounting to ₹ 18,215 Lakhs ( ₹ 15,271 Lakhs in 
March 31, 2023) shown under other expenses.
e) 	 The Group has recognised ₹ 1,110 Lakhs as miscellaneous expenses during the year ( ₹ 1,091 Lakhs in March 31, 2023) which pertains 
to short term lease/ low value asset which was not recognised as part of ROU.

(A) Department, Government of Kerala, granting permission under the Industrial Dispute Act, 1947 to close the Factory located at 
Nellikuzhi, near Kothamangalam. In the opinion of the management there were no further business opportunities for RADO to explore.

assets such as plant and machinery, equipment, spares and other assets  located at its factory near Kothamangalam. 
	
Given these circumstances, RADO's Board has considered prudent to reclassify the above assets having realizable value of ₹ 98 Lakhs

Provision for decommissioning liability
	
The Group has recognised a provision for decommissioning obligations associated with a land taken on lease at Nashik manufacturing 
facility for the production of tyres. In determining the fair value of the provision, assumptions and estimates are made in relation to

Cash Flow (DCF) method based on the following assumptions:
	
-	
Estimated range of cost per square meter: ₹ 45 – ₹ 50

Note 42: Post-retirement benefit plan
Refer note 2.16 for accounting policy on employee benefits
a) 	 Defined contribution plan
	
Refer note 32 for Group’s contribution to the defined contribution plans with respect to provident fund and other funds.
b) 	 Defined benefit plan - Gratuity
	
Description of plan
	
The Group has a defined benefit gratuity plan which is funded with an Insurance Company in the form of a qualifying Insurance 
policy. The Group's defined benefit gratuity plan is a salary plan for employees which requires contributions to be made to a separate 
administrative fund. The gratuity plan is governed by the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. Under the act, every employee who has 
completed five years of service gets a gratuity on separation at 15 days of last drawn salary for each completed year of service.
	
Governance
	
The fund has the form of a trust and it is governed by the Board of Trustees, which consists of employer and employee representatives. 
The Board of Trustees is responsible for the administration of the plan assets and for the definition of the investment strategy. Each year, 
the Board of Trustees reviews the level of funding. 
	
Investment Strategy
	
The Board of trustees have appointed LIC of India, Birla Sun Life Insurance, India First Life Insurance, Kotak Mahindra Life Insurance & 
HDFC Life Insurance to manage its funds. The Board of Trustees aim to keep annual contributions relatively stable at a level such that 
no plan deficits (based on valuation performed) will arise. Every year, the insurance Company carries out a funding valuation based on 
the latest employee data provided by the Group. Any deficit in the assets arising as a result of such valuation is funded by the Group. In 
case of death, while in service, the gratuity is payable irrespective of vesting.

These plans typically expose the Group to actuarial risks such as: Investment Risk, Interest Risk, Demographic Risk and Salary Risk.
 
Risk
Exposure
Interest
The plan exposes the Group to the risk of fall in interest rates. A fall in interest rates will result in an 
increase in the ultimate cost of providing the above benefit and will thus result in an increase in the 
value of the liability (as shown in financial statements).
Investment
 The probability or likelihood of occurrence of losses relative to the expected return on any particular 
investment.
Demographic
The Group has used certain mortality and attrition assumptions in valuation of the liability. The Group 
is exposed to the risk of actual experience turning out to be worse compared to the assumption.
Salary Escalation 
The present value of the defined benefit plan is calculated with the assumption of salary increase rate 
of plan participants in future. Deviation in the rate of increase of salary in future for plan participants 
from the rate of increase in salary used to determine the present value of obligation will have a 
bearing on the plan's liability.
Asset Liability 
Mismatching or Market 
Risk
The duration of the liabilty is longer compared to duration of assets, exposing the Company to market 
risk for volatilities/fall in interest rate.
Regulatory Risk
Gratuity benefit is paid in accordance with the requirements of the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 (as 
amended from time to time). There is a risk of change in regulations requiring higher gratuity payouts 
(e.g. Increase in the maximum limit on gratuity of H 20,00,000).

Group has to take prior permission of the appropriate authority for removal/transfer of any asset (falling under the above Schemes) 
from Nashik Plant. In case of violation of terms & conditions, the Group is required to refund the entire loan/benefit along with the 
interest @ 22.50% on account of Sales Tax deferral Loan and @ 15% on account of Octroi refund. 
d)    Material demands and disputes considered as “Remote” by the Group
	
The Group has been served with a Show Cause cum Demand Notice from the DGCEI (Directorate General of Central Excise Intelligence) 
Mumbai, on the ground that, the activity of making tyre set, i.e. inserting Tubes and Flaps inside the Tyres and tied up through 
Polypropylene Straps, amounts to manufacture / pre-packaged commodity under Section 2(f)(iii) of Central Excise Act, read with 
Section 2(l) of the Legal Metrology Act, 2009. Accordingly, the authorities worked out the differential duty amounting to ₹ 27,672 Lakhs, 
i.e., the difference between the amount of duty already paid on the basis of transaction value and duty payable on the basis of MRP 
under Section 4A, for the period from April 2011 to June 2017. The Group believes that Set of TT / TTF (Tyre and Tube / Tyre, Tube and 
Flap) is not a pre-packaged commodity in terms of provisions of Legal Metrology Act, 2009 read with Central Excise Act and Rules made 
thereunder. The Group has a strong case on the ground that, the said issue has been clarified by the Controller of the Legal Metrology 
Department vide its letter dated May 01, 1991 that “Tyre with tube & flaps tied with three thin polythene strips may not be treated as 
a pre-packed commodity within the meaning of rule 2(l) of the Standards of Weights and Measures (Packaged Commodities), Rules, 
1977”. The above clarification has been re-affirmed vide letter dated November 16, 1992 by the Legal Metrology authorities.

Note 46: Hedging activities and derivatives
Derivatives designated as hedging instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency forward contracts to hedge foreign currency risk arising from future 
transactions in respect of which firm commitments are made or which are highly probable forecast transactions. It also uses Cross Currency 
Interest Rate Swaps ('CCIRS') to hedge interest rate and foreign currency risk arising from variable rate foreign currency denominated loans. 
All these instruments are designated as hedging instruments and the necessary documentation for the same is made as per Ind AS 109.
Cash flow hedges
Foreign currency risk
The foreign exchange forward contract balances vary with the level of expected foreign currency sales and purchases and changes in 
foreign exchange forward rates.

* The trade payables / short term borrowings are naturally hedged (off-set) to the extent of exposure under trade receivables / advances for respective currencies.	
The terms of the foreign currency forward contracts match the terms of the expected highly probable forecast transactions. As a result, no 
hedge ineffectiveness arise requiring recognition through statement of profit and loss. 
The cash flow hedges as at March 31, 2024 were assessed to be highly effective and a net unrealised loss of ₹ 128 Lakhs, with a deferred tax 
asset of ₹ 32 Lakhs relating to the hedging instruments, is included in OCI. Comparatively, the cash flow hedges as at March 31, 2023 were 
assessed to be highly effective and a net unrealised gain of ₹1,150 Lakhs, with a deferred tax liability of ₹ 289 Lakhs relating to the hedging 
instruments, was included in OCI

Calculation of Fair Values
The fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are defined as the price that would be received on sale of an asset or paid to transfer a 
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair 
values are consistent with those used for the year ended March 31, 2023.
Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value as at Balance Sheet date:
Derivative financial instruments: The fair values of the derivative financial instruments has been determined using valuation techniques 
with market observable inputs. The models incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of counter-parties, foreign exchange 
forward rates, etc.	
Investment: The fair value is calculated using the Discounted Cashflow method where the significant unobservable input used is discount 
rate - 18.64%.

Note 48: Fair values hierarchy
The fair value of financial instruments as referred to in note 47 above have been classified into three categories depending on the inputs 
used in the valuation technique. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
(Level 1 measurements) and lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).	
The categories used are as follows:
 

Level 1: Quoted prices for identical instruments in an active market;
 

Level 2: Directly or indirectly observable market inputs, other than Level 1 inputs; and
 

Level 3: Inputs which are not based on observable market data.

Note 49: Financial risk management objectives and policies
The Group’s principal financial liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise loans and borrowings, trade and other payables. The main purpose 
of these financial liabilities is to finance the Group’s operations. The Group’s principal financial assets include trade and other receivables, 
cash and cash equivalents that derive directly from its operations. The Group’s also enters into derivative transactions.
The Group’s financial risk activities are governed by appropriate policies and procedures and that financial risks are identified, measured 
and managed in accordance with the Group’s policies and risk objectives. All derivative activities for risk management purposes are carried 
out by specialist teams that have the appropriate skills, experience and supervision. The Board of Directors through its Risk Management 
Committee reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.
a)	
Market risk
	
The Group’s size and operations result in it being exposed to the following market risks that arise from its use of financial instruments:
 

Interest rate risk;
 

Foreign currency risk;
 

Equity price risk; and
 

Commodity risk
	
	
The above risks may affect the Group’s income and expenses, or the value of its financial instruments. The Group’s exposure to and 
management of these risks are explained below.
	
	
The sensitivity of the relevant profit or loss item is the effect of the assumed changes in respective market risks. This is based on 
the financial assets and financial liabilities held at March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 including the effect of hedge accounting.
	
	
i. 	
Interest rate risk
Risk
Exposure
Risk Management
Risk that the fair value 
or future cash flows of a 
financial 
instrument 
will 
fluctuate because of changes 
in market interest rates.
Relates 
primarily 
to 
the Group’s long-term 
debt obligations with 
floating interest rates.
The Group manages its interest rate risk pertaining to domestic 
borrowings by maintaining a balanced portfolio of borrowings 
linked to various tenor benchmark of MCLR, Repo rate and T-Bills. 
The Group enters into interest rate swaps, in which it agrees to 
exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed 
and variable rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an 
agreed-upon notional principal amount. 
As at March 31, 2024, after taking into account the effect of interest 
rate swaps, approximately 34% of the Group’s total borrowings 
are at a fixed rate of interest (March 31, 2023: 30%).

Risk
Exposure
Risk Management
Risk that the fair value or 
future cash flows of an 
exposure will fluctuate 
because of changes in 
foreign exchange rates. 
Relates 
primarily 
to 
the 
Group’s 
operating 
activities 
(when  revenue or expense 
is denominated in a foreign 
currency) 
For the committed transactions, The Group manages its foreign 
currency risk by hedging transactions till the actual date of inflow 
& outflow. When a derivative is entered into for the purpose 
of being a hedge, the Group negotiates the terms of those 
derivatives to match the terms of the hedged exposure. For 
hedges of forecast transactions, the derivatives cover the period 
of exposure from the point the cash flows of the transactions 
are forecasted up to the point of settlement of the resulting 
receivable or payable that is denominated in the foreign currency.

Foreign currency sensitivity
	
	
	
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in USD and EURO rates, with all other 
variables held constant. The impact on the Group’s profit before tax is due to changes in the fair value of monetary assets and 
liabilities. The Group’s exposure to foreign currency changes for all other currencies is not material.

The movement in the pre-tax effect is a result of a change in the fair value of the financial asset/liability due to the exchange 
rate movement. The derivatives which have not been designated in a hedge relationship act as an economic hedge and will 
offset the underlying transactions when they occur. The same derivatives are not covered in the above table.
	
	
	
In management’s opinion, the sensitivity analysis is unrepresentative of the inherent foreign exchange risk because the 
exposure at the end of the reporting period does not reflect the exposure during the year.

The Group’s Board of Directors has reviewed and approved 
a risk management strategy regarding commodity price 
risk and its mitigation.	
	
	
	
	
Commodity price sensitivity
	
	
	
The following table approximately details the Group’s sensitivity to a 5% movement in the input price of rubber and carbon 
black. The sensitivity analysis includes only 5% change in commodity prices for quantity sold or consumed during the year, 
with all other variables held constant. A positive number below indicates an increase in profit or equity where the commodity 
prices decrease by 5%. For a 5% increase in commodity prices, there would be a comparable impact on profit or equity, and 
the balances below would be negative.
b)	 Credit risk
	
Trade receivables
	
Risk:  Credit risk is the risk that counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to 
a financial loss.
	
Risk Management: Customer credit risk is managed by each business unit subject to the Group’s established policy, procedures and 
control relating to customer credit risk management.
	
Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are generally on 27 days to 60 days credit term. Credit limits are established for all 
customers based on internal rating criteria. Outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored. An impairment analysis is 
performed at each reporting date on an individual basis for major customers. In addition, a large number of minor receivables are 
grouped into homogenous groups and assessed for impairment collectively. The Group has no concentration of credit risk as the 
customer base is widely distributed both economically and geographically.
	
Export receivables are against Letter of Credit, bank guarantees, payment against documents. For open credit exports insurance cover 
is taken. Generally deposits are taken from domestic debtors under replacement segment. The carrying amount and fair value of 
security deposit from dealers amounts to ₹ 53,862 Lakhs (March 31, 2023: ₹ 49,713 Lakhs) as it is payable on demand. The maximum 
exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financial assets.

Liquidity risk
	
The Group prepares cash flow on a daily basis to monitor liquidity. Any shortfall is funded out of short term loans. Any surplus is 
invested in appropriate mutual funds or bank deposits. The Group also monitors the liquidity on a longer term wherein it is ensured 
that the long term assets are funded by long term liabilities. The Group ensures that the duration of its current assets is in line with the 
current liabilities to ensure adequate liquidity in the 3-6 months period.
	
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments.

Note 50: Capital management	
For the purpose of the Group capital management, capital includes issued equity capital, share premium and all other equity reserves 
attributable to the equity holders of the Group. The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to maximise the shareholder value.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments in light of changes in economic conditions and the requirements of the 
financial covenants. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital 
to shareholders or issue new shares. The Group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is net debt divided by total capital plus net 
debt. The Group includes within net debt, interest bearing loans and borrowings, trade and other payables, less cash and cash equivalents.

In order to achieve this overall objective, the Group’s capital management, amongst other things, aims to ensure that it meets financial 
covenants attached to the interest-bearing loans and borrowings that define capital structure requirements. Breaches in meeting the 
financial covenants would permit the bank to immediately call loans and borrowings. There have been no breaches in the financial covenants 
of any interest-bearing loans and borrowing in the current period.
No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes for managing capital during the years ended March 31, 2024 and 
March 31, 2023.
Note 51: Material foreseeable losses
