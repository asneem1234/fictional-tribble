At MSTC, we continue to uphold our unwavering commitment to promoting good corporate governance, conducting

in all contracts, epitomizes this dedication, reﬂecting our commitment to ethical practices as suggested by Transparency

ESG-Related Achievements
Governance, Leadership and Oversight
 
The Indian economy concluded the past ﬁscal year on a robust note, driven by strong business and consumer sentiments, 
sustained public investment, easing inﬂation, and a favorable external environment. However, extended geopolitical 
tensions and persistent high real interest rates pose risks to the growth trajectory.
7. 
Statement by Director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets 
and achievements (listed entity has ﬂexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
 
This year, we signiﬁcantly enhanced our employee training programs. Compared to less than 2% of employees trained on 
safety and health last year, 60% received training this year. Additionally, skill upgradation training increased by nearly 10%, 
reﬂecting our commitment to employee development and workplace safety.

Strategic Initiatives and Targets
 
Our efforts to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have seen substantial growth. Last year, 38% of our 
input material was sourced from MSMEs. This year, we increased this to over 81%, demonstrating our dedication to 
fostering local economies and supporting small businesses.
 
We have made signiﬁcant improvements in median remuneration at all levels for both genders, ensuring fair and equitable 
pay across the organization.
 
MSTC has spent approximately ` 3.78 crores on CSR activities in the health sector across various states, including Assam, 
Sikkim, Odisha, Karnataka, Kerala, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal.
 
MSTC has been awarded ﬁrst prize by Narakas, Kolkata, for best ofﬁcial language implementation in the corporate ofﬁce 
category, along with several other regional and branch ofﬁce awards, setting a record with ﬁve Narakas Awards this year. 
This shows our commitment to be inclusive for the majority of population who are better suited with the ofﬁcial language.
 
MSTC continues to lead in promoting a circular economy. We have added two more Registered Vehicle Scrapping Facilities 
(RVSFs) at Guwahati and Bengaluru through our JV company, MMRPL, and launched an ELV auction portal for the disposal 
of 'End-Of-Life' Vehicles.
 
We are exploring new areas of recycling, such as ferrous material, aircraft, e-waste, textile recycling, and other hazardous 
waste. 
 
Cybersecurity Risks: We continue to face the threat of cyber-attacks, which could impact business operations, reputation, 
and ﬁnancial stability. Ensuring robust cybersecurity measures remains a top priority.
 
Future Outlook
 
Our focus remains on developing integrated, paperless, and seamless services for various government and non-
government organizations. MSTC's V3 Enterprise Procurement Solution continues to set industry standards, and we are 
committed to further enhancing our e-commerce platform to meet evolving customer needs.
 
As we navigate the ESG landscape, MSTC remains dedicated to creating sustainable value for all stakeholders through 
innovation, ethical practices, and a commitment to environmental stewardship. 
 
Finally, I would like to thank all our stakeholders, including employees, customers, and suppliers for their trust and 
conﬁdence in MSTC. We assure you that we remain steadfast in our commitment to creating sustainable value and 
continuing to uphold the highest standards of corporate governance and social responsibility.

At MSTC, we are committed to reducing our environmental footprint and actively engaging in projects that mitigate greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions. This year, we have made signiﬁcant strides through several key initiatives. We have added two more 
Registered Vehicle Scrapping Facilities (RVSFs) at Guwahati and Bengaluru with an allocated expense of ` 5 crores, expanding 
our total to 40 locations across India, including 33 collection centers and 7 dismantling centers. These facilities ensure the safe 
and efﬁcient disposal of end-of-life vehicles, preventing the release of harmful pollutants and promoting recycling. By recycling 
automotive parts and materials, we signiﬁcantly reduce the need for new raw materials, thereby decreasing emissions 
associated with manufacturing and resource extraction.
 
Through these initiatives, MSTC has made signiﬁcant progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Our efforts in vehicle 
scrapping, recycling expansion, tree plantation, and the development of integrated digital services, along with the construction of 
our green corporate ofﬁce building, are pivotal in minimizing our environmental impact. These projects not only support our 
sustainability goals but also demonstrate our commitment to creating a greener and more sustainable future.
 
As part of our commitment to a greener environment, MSTC has also engaged in tree plantation initiatives, enhancing green cover 
and contributing to carbon sequestration efforts. Furthermore, over the preceding two ﬁnancial years, we have invested ` 8.78 
crores towards the construction of a new green corporate ofﬁce building. This state-of-the-art facility incorporates sustainable 
building practices, further reducing our carbon footprint and promoting energy efﬁciency.
8. Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details. 
 
We are also exploring new areas of recycling, such as ferrous material, aircraft, e-waste, textile recycling, and other hazardous 
waste. By diversifying our recycling efforts, we reduce various types of waste and support the circular economy. Recycling these 
materials lowers the overall demand for virgin resources and the energy consumption associated with their extraction and 
processing, leading to reduced GHG emissions.
 
Additionally, MSTC launched an End-Of-Life Vehicles (ELV) auction portal for the disposal of 'End-Of-Life' Vehicles for Central and 
State Governments, extending services to individual ELV owners. The portal facilitates the recycling of vehicles, reducing landﬁll 
waste and promoting resource recovery. Recycling metal and other vehicle components reduces the energy required compared 
to producing new materials, thus cutting down on GHG emissions.
 
Moreover, MSTC has created integrated, paperless, and seamless services for various government and non-government 
organizations. Reducing paper usage and administrative waste directly contributes to lower GHG emissions associated with 
paper production, transportation, and disposal. Streamlined digital processes also reduce energy consumption related to 
traditional administrative functions.
