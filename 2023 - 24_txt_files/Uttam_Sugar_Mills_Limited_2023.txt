1
Raw Material
Sourcing
Risk
Sugar industry is an agro based 
industry and its main raw material 
is sugarcane. In any year, if 
there is a shortfall in sugarcane 
production on account of adverse 
climatic conditions, the amount 
of sugar produced by the sugar 
mills is affected adversely. Apart 
from 
climatic 
conditions, 
the 
sugar cane crop may also be 
impacted 
by 
the 
occurrence 
of crop disease. Proper water 
management through irrigation 
during the formative stage of 
the cane is critical to the sucrose 
content and overall quality of the 
cane. In case the quality /quantity 
of cane is affected by any of the 
aforementioned conditions, we 
may not be able to optimally 
utilize our crushing capacity. This 
will directly affect our profitability. 
We always make sure 
that sugarcane is sourced 
on time. When the sugar 
season begins we source 
best quality of sugarcane 
for which we conduct 
training of farmers. When 
the season of harvest 
begins we procure the 
sugarcane on time.
Out of our four sugar 
manufacturing units three 
is located in the state of 
Uttar Pradesh and one 
is in Uttarakhand. All the 
units have been located 
at the places where risk 
associated 
with 
sugar 
cane sourcing is minimum. 
Negative
In case of poor procurement 
of sugarcane, financials of the 
company can be impacted. 
Inefficient 
procurement 
practices in raw materials can 
lead to higher procurement 
costs and affect profit margins.

Latest emission control technology (ESP) is 
installed along with boiler. 
To reduce ambient air pollution caused by 
suspended particulate matter, we added wet 
scrubbers (benchmark below 150 PPM and 
target below 100 PPM).
Condensate being processed through CPU 
and being reused in process.
Saving in fuel and ground

Effluent Management
MEE is installed to concentrate the distillery 
effluents and generate slop which is being 
used as supplementary fuel in boiler.
Effluent generated in plant treated by ETP 
plant by achieving all parameters as per 
CPCB guidelines and treated water is being 
used for irrigation.

has 
generated 
proprietary 
renewable (co-generated) power. During the 
period between 2023-24, the USML have 
sold 1504.02 Lakh kwh in FY 2022-23 and 
1374.14  Lakh kwh in FY- 2023-24.
