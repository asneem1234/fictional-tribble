26.	 Overview of the Company’s material responsible business conduct and sustainability issues pertaining to environment

Financial 
implications 
of the risk or 
opportunity 
(Indicate 
positive or 
negative 
implications)
1
Product Quality 
and Safety, and 
Data integrity
Risk
The Company recognizes the legal 
risks associated with non-compliance 
to required standards, particularly 
when product ingredients could 
trigger allergies or conflict with 
religious sensitivities. It understands 
that product safety, quality, and data 
integrity are crucial for satisfying 
customer 
needs 
and 
creating 
stakeholder value. Any shortcomings 
in these areas could have significant 
implications.
Each manufacturing location has a 
dedicated quality team that ensures 
consistent 
audit 
preparedness 
and 
quality performance. The Company uses 
technology to digitalize and improve 
quality assurance processes. It follows 
a targeted quality enhancement and 
training program to address past quality 
issues. It also has strong Corrective and 
Preventive Action (CAPA) procedures to 
handle non-compliance. Furthermore, the 
Company thoroughly assesses vendors 
and suppliers to ensure they meet the 
food safety standards set by FSSC.
Negative
2
EHS
Risk
EHS incidents can lead to several 
consequences 
including 
non-
compliance 
with 
regulations 
resulting 
in 
fines, 
operational 
interruptions causing productivity 
losses, damage to reputation leading 
to a loss of stakeholder trust, and 
liabilities for environmental clean-up 
or worker compensation.
The Company is actively managing 
EHS risks throughout its operations. 
This involves the use of a thorough EHS 
management system and compliance 
with legal and regulatory requirements, 
including 
those 
related 
to 
E-waste 
management and EHS policy.
Negative
3
Supply Chain
Risk
The Company could face operational 
and procurement difficulties if a 
vendor stops supplying, especially 
as it relies on single-source key 
raw materials. Such disruptions 
could result in increased prices. To 
mitigate this, the Company procures 
agricultural 
commodities 
directly 
from farmers and APMC, ensuring 
that it doesn’t depend on a single 
supplier for palm oil and other raw 
materials.
The 
procurement 
team 
is 
actively 
identifying new vendors and keeping 
a record of approved alternatives for 
certain raw materials. The Company is 
also seeking more vendor sources to 
lessen the risk linked to dependency on a 
single source
Negative
4
IT Security & 
Data Protection
Risk
The network is vulnerable to cyber 
attacks, 
which 
could 
potentially 
result in the loss of data or breach of 
confidential information.
The Company has a documented Standard 
Operating Procedure (SOP) that includes 
a detailed disaster recovery and business 
continuity plan. This plan outlines backup, 
archival, and restoration processes. IT 
controls are tested annually, and regular 
reviews of SAP user access are conducted 
to ensure duties are properly segregated. 
An application control firewall is in place, 
and email content is consistently monitored 
to prevent confidential data from being 
sent to external email IDs.

People
Risk
The absence of a succession plan for 
crucial roles could potentially cause 
delays in business decisions and 
disrupt operations.
The 
Company 
is 
running 
several 
programs to manage employee turnover 
and retain key talent. These initiatives 
include promoting work-life balance, 
enhancing rewards and recognition, and 
implementing succession planning for key 
roles with talent calibration.

Energy Efficient
Opportunities
Prioritize the use of alternative 
energy sources such as Solar power 
to minimize emissions, and optimize 
the utilization of natural resources.

Corporate 
Governance
Risk
Non-compliance 
with 
regulatory 
and statutory requirements can 
affect the Company’s operations, 
future fundraising capabilities, and 
Company valuation.
The Company complies with all regulatory 
and statutory requirements, protects 
investor interests with strict governance 
protocols, 
and 
addresses 
concerns 
through Investor Relations and Grievance 
Redressal Policy.
