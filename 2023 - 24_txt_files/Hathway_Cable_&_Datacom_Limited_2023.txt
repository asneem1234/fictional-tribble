(Indicate positive or

Climate Change 
Action
Risk
Climate change and extreme weather events are disrupting supply 
chains, endangering lives, and harming ecosystems globally. 
Regulatory enforcement to mitigate these impacts may result in legal 
and reputational risks and operational disruptions. Failure to comply 
with these regulations erodes stakeholder trust, impacting financial 
performance and hindering value creation for all stakeholders.
The Company actively implements sustainable practices and assesses 
climate change impacts on its operations. Emphasising transparency and 
stakeholder engagement, the Company strengthens its Environmental, Social, 
and Governance ("ESG") Policy to guide internal and external activities. This 
concerted effort aims to create sustainable value for all stakeholders amidst 
climate challenges.
Negative

usage and 
management
Risk
Energy management is crucial for operational efficiency and cost 
reduction. Inefficient energy use increases operational expenses 
and carbon emissions, contributing to environmental degradation. 
Moreover, reliance on non-renewable energy sources poses risks 
associated with price volatility and supply chain disruptions, impacting 
financial performance and sustainability goals.
The Company focuses on implementing energy-efficient technologies and 
increasing the adoption of renewable energy sources, which can enhance 
operational resilience, reduce costs, and mitigate environmental impact. It is 
also building capacity to reinforce the importance of energy efficiency measures

viability.

Hathway to adopt circular economy principles. Effective management 
of electronic waste can generate revenue through recycling and 
refurbishment, promote resource efficiency, and enhance the brand’s 
reputation as a sustainability leader. Embracing circular economy 
models fosters innovation, reduces environmental impact, and creates 
new revenue streams.
Hathway continuously works on establishing partnerships with recycling firms, 
investing in advanced recycling technologies, and developing product designs 
focused on reuse and recyclability. The Company is implementing take-back 
programmes, educating consumers on responsible disposal, and promoting 
the resale of refurbished products to maximise value extraction from electronic 
waste. The Company’s ESG Policy guides its actions on embracing circular 
economy principles across the value chain, fostering innovation, reducing waste, 
and cultivating a competitive advantage in the sustainable market landscape.
Positive

culture, improves productivity, and enhances retention rates. Investing

motivated and skilled workforce drives innovation and organisational 
success.

environment that helps employees maintain work- life balance. In addition, the

talents of individuals from different backgrounds, the Company will accelerate 
innovation and decision-making processes while broadening equal opportunities 
for the growth and development of employees across the board.
Positive

Safety
Risk
A responsible organisation must place utmost importance on protecting 
the occupational health and safety of its employees. This entails 
that their physical and mental health must be cared for through the 
implementation of safety measures and awareness programmes.
The Company’s employee welfare policy puts employee health and safety 
at the core. The policy guides the Company’s efforts to provide safe and 
hygienic working conditions for employees. Hathway recognises that a safe 
and conducive workplace is essential not only for employee satisfaction and 
productivity but also for the ongoing success of the organisation.
Negative

realises the significance of fostering positive labour relations to address 
the needs and rights of its entire workforce and run the business without 
disruptions.

behaviour at the workplace. It reinforces the Company’s commitment to ensuring 
the protection of employee rights and prevents the use of forced or child labour 
and harassment on any ground. The policy also has provisions for awareness-

an essential component of the Company’s approach to holistic and 
inclusive value creation. The Company must implement developmental 
programmes that foster community upliftment and generate tangible 
and sustainable socioeconomic benefits so that no one is left behind.
The Company’s EHS and Sustainable development policies address issues 
that are concerned with community welfare and development in a fair and 
equitable manner. Moreover, the policies emphasise the importance of 
promoting equitable access to resources, opportunities, and benefits arising 
from Hathway’s operations.
Positive
Board 
Ownership and 
Control
Opportunity
To ensure fair operations, the Company needs to set up a clear and fair 
Board ownership and control mechanism to run the operations.
A Code of Conduct Policy has been instituted specifically for Board members to 
ensure integrity is maintained. Further, the Company also has a succession plan 
in place to ensure continuity of leadership in the face of unforeseen leadership 
exits. The Code of Conduct serves as a guiding framework to promote ethical 
conduct, transparency, and accountability among the board members, fostering

top run of leadership.
Positive

a commitment to business ethics and integrity across every aspect of the 
business. The Code not only outlines expected behaviours and practices but also 
reinforces the organisation’s commitment to upholding the highest standards of 
professional conduct, promoting a culture of integrity that permeates throughout 
the entire workforce, vendors and partners.
Positive

Security
Risk
To safeguard the Company’s operations, infrastructure, customers 
and internal users against cybersecurity threats, the Company must 
prioritise data privacy and cybersecurity by implementing measures 
that increase its systems and processes.

identification of risks, development of mitigation plans and monitoring of the 
progress of actions undertaken to create a resilient organisation. The company

that incentivise them to perform and benchmark their capabilities. Through the 
KPIs, the Company aims to align individual goals with organisational objectives, 
creating a synergistic approach to transparent performance evaluation and 
accountability.
Positive
Fair Marketing & 
Transparency
Risk
As a responsible organisation, Hathway needs to ensure its services 
are sold through transparent and fair marketing practices and delivered 
in line with the committed quality and performance goals. This is integral 
to the continued success of the organisation. Any misinformation can

Yes, the Company has designated a central point of contact responsible for addressing human rights impacts or issues stemming

In addition to the internal mechanisms, the employees also have the option to approach the Chairman of the Audit Committee to 
address any grievances related to human rights violations or any other violations within the company. This provides an additional 
avenue for employees to seek a resolution and ensures that there is a higher level of accountability for addressing such issues. 
The dual mechanism ensures that employees have multiple avenues to seek resolution and that there exists a heightened level 
of accountability for addressing such matters within the organisation.

industry best practices, setting specific targets, reviewing performance regularly, and adapting its policies accordingly.
	
The Company employs a multifaceted approach to address human rights grievances, encompassing various internal mechanisms.
	
•

rights impacts arising from its operations.
	
•
