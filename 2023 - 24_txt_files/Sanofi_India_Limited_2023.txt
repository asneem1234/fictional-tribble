TouStar Toujeo® has garnered prestigious accolades such as the Eco-
Design award at Pharmapack and the Good Design award in 2022 
as the first-in-class reusable pen. It marks a significant advancement 
as the inaugural reusable injection pen for concentrated insulin, 
featuring a dedicated replaceable cartridge system.
In the Indian market, TouStar outperforms SoloStar, demonstrating 
its superiority as a three-year reusable device. The potential 
environmental benefits are substantial, including a 57% reduction 
in climate change impact, a 74% decrease in water usage, and a 
58% decline in fossil resource depletion. These results stem from the 
efficient utilization of plastics, which are saved and reused within a 
closed loop over the span of three years.
Moreover, TouStar contributes to environmental conservation by 
minimizing airfreight during component imports to India, optimizing 
device packaging, and incorporating recyclable/takeback features.
Sanofi group has embraced an eco-design approach aimed at enhancing the environmental performance of products 
or services from their inception throughout their entire life cycle. This approach encompasses a holistic perspective 
covering raw materials, manufacturing, packaging, distribution, use, and end-of-life considerations. Products are 
assessed based on multi-criteria indicators such as climate change, ecosystems, resources, water, and human health, 
with the overarching goal of reducing environmental impacts on a global scale.
Sanofi believes that integrating eco-design principles into projects can stimulate innovation, lower costs, and mitigate 
the environmental footprint of its operations while also enhancing the social dimension of its endeavors.

Has the company implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its coverage 
and implementation. 
	
At the Goa site, we have installed a state-of-the-art and implemented an effluent treatment plant to responsibly 
manage the wastewater generated from production processes. Following treatment, the effluent is utilised for 
gardening purposes, aligning with our commitment to sustainable water management practices. Across our Mumbai 
site, we have installed a sewage treatment plant to effectively treat domestic sewage. The treated sewage effluent 
is then utilized for toilet flushing and gardening, minimizing our environmental impact while maximizing resource 
efficiency. Any excess quantity beyond our internal requirements at the Mumbai office is discharged in accordance 
with regulations set forth by the Pollution Control Board, ensuring compliance with environmental standards. Through 
these initiatives, we uphold our dedication to environmental stewardship and sustainable business practices, actively 
contributing to the preservation of our natural resources and the well-being of our communities.

of landfilling hazardous waste from its operations. For non-hazardous waste such as plastic, paper, wood, glass, and 
metal, Sanofi follows recycling practices and adheres to the applicable Plastic Waste Management rules. We also 
abide by Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) by collecting end-use plastic and ensuring approved disposal 
methods sanctioned by the Central Pollution Control Board. Additionally, all non-saleable pharmaceutical products 
at distributor locations are collected and sent for incineration.

product safety and proper usage. This commitment 
reflects our dedication to transparency and ensuring 
the well-informed use of our products. Consumers are
