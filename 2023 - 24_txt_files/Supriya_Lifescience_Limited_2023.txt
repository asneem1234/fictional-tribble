management 
regulations 
and establishing goals for 
reducing water. Furthermore, 
continuously 
discovering 
and 
implementing 
better 
ways to measure and reduce 
water usage through various 
technologies and behaviour 
change within the workforce
Negative - Water management risks may result in negative 
financial implications apart from scarcity of this resource. - No 
immediate financial impact is anticipated

In the past year, we have made significant progress in enhancing the positive impact that we create. We have incorporated a solar project, that within 
two months of operations generated over 9 lakh units of clean electricity, thus enabling us to reduce our carbon footprint. We remain committed to using 
sustainable fuels in our operations, and in the past year, approximately 57% of our energy needs have been sourced from renewable sources such as solar, 
biofuel, bagasse briquettes etc. We have also developed additional processes to increase our data coverage. On the value chain front, we have increased our 
coverage of sustainable sourcing to 70% this year from 60% last year.
On the social front, our robust health and safety system has continued to ensure 0 incidents of injuries, and 97% of our workforce has been trained on health 
and safety measures this year. 100% of our operations have been assessed for health and safety practices, this extends to 60% for our value chain. We are also 
continuously looking to improve the access and affordability of the products that we manufacture. 
With respect to governance, our commitment to strong ethics, integrity, and corporate governance remains the cornerstone of our ESG journey. We continue 
to maintain stringent IT protocols and have had zero incidents of data breaches this year. 
In our ESG journey, we are continuously aiming to set the benchmark higher and enhancing the value that we create for our stakeholders. We would like to 
extend our gratitude to all our stakeholders for supporting us in this journey.

improvement objectives and periodic reviews through the Safety and Health Committees, each headed by a Management 
Committee Member to ensure that we achieve our targets. A robust audit mechanism is in place to verify compliance to internal 
standards as well statutory requirements. A safety culture is promoted by undertaking behavioural interventions at all levels and 
disseminating the importance of safety as a personal value. Positive safety behaviours are promoted, while unsafe behaviours are 
corrected through established procedures. A comprehensive emergency response plan and related facilities are maintained at all 
sites and employees are trained to respond accordingly.

Miyawaki forest Witness to incredible word of urban forest, developed 
through the Miyawaki approach. Miyawaki is a 
methodology accelerating the formation of dense, 
indigenous forest ecosystem in contrast to traditional 
reforestation techniques. The existence of Miyawaki 
forest enhances mental wellbeing. It mitigates the 
adverse impact of air pollution while combating the 
urban heat island effect, where vast swaths of concrete 
and asphalt artificially elevate temperature within cities
The denseness of a Miyawaki forest is great for 
creating biodiversity; it also increases carbon 
capture, pollution filtration and produces an 
area more resilient to flooding and landslides
