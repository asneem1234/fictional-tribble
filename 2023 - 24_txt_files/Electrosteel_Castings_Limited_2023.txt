1 
GHG Emissions 
and Climate 
Change 
Risk 
Risk 
The ductile iron pipe & fittings 
production process contributes to
greenhouse 
gases 
with 
emissions 
arising primarily during the conversion 
of iron ore to iron or subsequent 
refining of the iron to finished ductile 
iron products. 
 
 
ECL has commissioned an environment cell 
that prioritizes mitigating emissions with 
utmost importance adhering to ISO 14001 
standards. 
 
The Company has implemented a 12 MW 
power plant at the Haldia CDM (Clean 
Development 
Mechanism) 
project, 
enabling power generation through waste 
heat and significantly reducing GHG 
emissions. This project is also registered 
under the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 
as a CDM project. 
 
Environment 
compliance 
reports 
are
submitted annually to the respective 
pollution control boards for monitoring 
Negative 
progress and transparency. 
2 
Energy 
Management 
Risk & Opportunity 
Risk: 
The manufacturing processes of our 
products, such as ductile iron and cast-
iron pipes and fittings, require energy, 
which is sourced from captive power 
plants and the grid. Optimizing energy 
is key to ensuring efficient production, 
reducing costs, and improving financial 
stability.  
   
  Opportunity: 
Implementing 
energy-efficient 
technologies and processes to reduce 
energy consumption per unit of output 
also 
results 
in 
improved 
overall 
efficiency. 
The Company’s Khardah units are certified 
with the ISO 50001 energy management 
system (EMS) which enhances energy 
performance, increases energy efficiency, 
and 
reduces 
energy 
costs, 
thereby 
contributing to sustainability goals and 
reducing environmental impact. 
 
ECL has implemented initiatives to reduce
fuel and electricity usage, harnessing waste 
gases, and enhancing renewable energy 
capabilities. 
Positive 
& 
Negative 
3 
Water 
Management 
Risk/ Opportunity 
Risk: 
The manufacturing process requires
water as a key input. Ineffective water 
management 
can 
lead 
to 
non-
compliance, impacting the company’s 
operations and creating reputational 
risks as well as ecological impacts on 
the water level in the surrounding 
region. 
 
Opportunity: 
The environment management cell actively 
engages in implementing measures to 
minimize water consumption and prevent 
water wastage. 
 
The Company has set up a state-of-the-art 
effluent 
treatment 
plant 
(ETP). 
Additionally, it conducts regular effluent 
water analysis to ensure compliance, and 
reports are submitted to the authorities. 
 
Positive  
&  
Negative 
Implementing water-saving measures 
not only reduces costs but also 
enhances compliance and reputation. 
Strong water management practices 
can attract environmentally conscious 
stakeholders, offering a competitive 
edge. 
 
At one of the facilities, the company 
collects 
sewage 
water 
from 
the 
municipality. This wastewater undergoes 
treatment through a sewage treatment 
plant (STP) and is utilized in the production 
process. This recycling initiative has 
resulted in significant conservation of 
freshwater resources. 
4 
Waste 
Management 
Risk/Opportunity 
Risk: 
The manufacturing process generates 
both hazardous and non-hazardous 
waste. Improper management of this 
waste 
can 
lead 
to 
negative 
environmental 
impacts, 
affect 
the 
workforce, and can harm nearby 
communities, potentially resulting in 
non-compliance with regulations. 
 
Opportunity: 
Implementing 
efficient 
waste 
management practices can lead to cost 
savings through reduced disposal costs 
and increased efficiency in resource 
utilization. Further, it ensures that the 
Company 
remains 
compliant 
with 
environmental regulations. 
 
The Company's facilities are ISO 14001-
certified, and it has adopted a systematic 
waste management method to ensure that 
waste materials are properly handled, 
stored, and disposed of. 
 
Most of the process waste generated 
during operations can be reprocessed and 
utilized as raw materials to manufacture 
different products.  
 
Hazardous waste such as used oil/waste 
lubricating oil, zinc dust, and used 
batteries are stored and disposed of by 
authorized recyclers in accordance with 
CPCB/SPCB rules. 
Positive  
&  
Negative 
 
5 
Health & 
Safety 
Risk & Opportunity 
Risk: 
The manufacturing process is exposed 
hazards, including occupational health 
The Company's facilities are ISO 45001 
certified, and it is committed to creating 
and maintaining a culture of high safety. 
Positive  
&  
Negative 
risks 
such 
as 
exposure 
to 
high 
temperatures and machinery accidents. 
Failure to address these risks can result 
in injuries and adversely impact the 
Company's reputation. 
 
Opportunity: 
Prioritizing employee health and safety 
enhances morale, boosts productivity, 
and improves retention rates.
 
The Company regularly conducts health 
and safety assessments, mock drills,
training awareness sessions, and health 
check-ups for its employees and workers. 
 
To ensure safety, the workers are provided 
with necessary PPE based on the risks they 
are exposed to in their operations.

Community

Corporate 
Social 
Responsibility
Opportunity 
The Company’s vision extends beyond 
pioneering technology and innovation, 
embracing a holistic approach to 
societal impact. This provides an 
opportunity to actively engage in 
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) 
programs in the areas of education, and 
community development health and 
safety. This commitment underscores 
the Company’s dedication to creating 
positive change and fostering a better

This enables building a positive image

10. Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe 
the strategy adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in 
your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes. 
The Company has aligned itself with the ISO 14001 environmental management system and has 
established standard operating procedures for handling hazardous and non-hazardous waste. All 
units have dedicated waste management systems in place. Each respective division collects and 
segregates the waste, storing it in designated locations. Major hazardous waste, such as zinc dust, 
is sent to authorized recyclers with a complete manifest system. Bitumen waste is collected safely 
and reused in the process, avoiding disposal. Other hazardous wastes are accumulated and disposed 
of according to a 90-day schedule with SPCB/CPCB authorized vendors. 
 
In an effort to minimize the use of hazardous and toxic chemicals in products and processes, the 
Company adheres to Operation Control Procedures (OCP) and complies with legal directives. 
Further, plant inspections are conducted for hazardous waste and chemical handling compliance. 
These measures aim to reduce environmental impact and ensure responsible chemical management 
throughout the Company's operations.

Does the entity have a framework/ policy on cyber security and risks related to data privacy? 
ECL has implemented a comprehensive array of cyber tools and measures to safeguard the 
cybersecurity and data privacy of its customers. This includes the deployment of a Next Generation 
Endpoint Detection & Response System (EDR) across all servers and workstations connected to the 
corporate LAN, providing robust protection against malware, viruses, ransomware, and other cyber 
threats. Additionally, USB ports on end-user workstations have been blocked to prevent data 
leakage and unauthorized access. ECL employs web filtering and application control mechanisms to
