Risk 
Management 
and Business 
Continuity  
Risk
Our environment both geopolitically and 
in terms of regulations  is complicated. 
Unwanted events like natural disasters, 
workplace accidents, wars, sanctions, 
continuous cyberattacks, and other 
similar events can have a substantial 
negative impact on our operations and 
commitment to meet patient demands in 
the absence of strong business continuity 
plans and safeguards.
The Company has an Enterprise 
Risk management program 
which helps in identifying and 
addressing risks impacting  
business operations.
This includes external and 
internal risks , as well as 
specific emerging risk events 
and business continuity events. 
More recently the company 
has embarked on a formal 
BCMS journey aligned to the 
ISO 22301 framework with the 
objective of getting accredited 
by June 2025.
Negative
2
Climate 
change
Risk
Climate change actions may not be 
adequate, and ESG priorities may not 
be collectively met by all participating 
organizations and nations, thereby, 
leading to unforeseen risk events. Rise in 
sea levels in the medium term (5-7 years) 
may increase the severity of extreme 
weather events such as cyclones and 
floods in our logistics and supply chains. 
In the next 3-5 years, our ESG priorities 
may require planned investments.
The Company has adopted the 
TCFD framework for Climate 
Change and associated 
sustainability risks. Presently 
potential  physical and 
transition risks are identified 
and responses are planned.
Going forward it is proposed 
to capture relevant data to 
quantify impact on climate 
change on the company.
Company is invested in several  
initiatives linked to minimizing 
Environmental emissions.

Community 
Wellbeing
Opportunity
Investing in community wellbeing 
initiatives can enhance the quality of life 
for local communities, foster goodwill, 
and build stronger relationships with 
stakeholders. By engaging in community 
development programs, supports local 
education and health initiatives, and 
collaborates with community leaders to 
address their needs.
The Company’s ESG priorities 
actively considers community 
well being and  the Company’s 
Social initiatives are focused on 
the well being of the proximate

Digitalization
Risk and 
Opportunity
Digitalization increases communication 
efficiency while also increasing openness. 
Enhanced digitization brings with it risks 
from inadequate training as well as new 
cybersecurity vulnerabilities.
Neuland follows a strong 
governance framework based 
upon NIST and ISMS 27001 
to assess and monitor cyber 
security risks and controls.
The company’s mitigation 
among others includes 
adequate user awareness, 
responsive and timely 
incident management, Data 
leakage prevention and a risk 
governance structure linked to 
the overall ERM structure.

Ethics and 
Compliance
Risk & 
Opportunity
Maintaining high ethical standards and 
compliance with laws and regulations is 
critical to avoid legal penalties, financial 
losses, and damage to our reputation.
The Company has implemented 
comprehensive compliance 
programs, regular employee 
training on ethical conduct, and 
a zero-tolerance policy towards 
corruption and misconduct. 
A whistleblower program 
encourages reporting of 
unethical behavior.
 Negative
8
Human 
capital 
development
Risk and 
Opportunity
Skill upgradation of the employees has 
a direct positive impact on the growth 
of the business. On the other hand, the 
risks associated with employee non-
engagement, inability to attract or retain 
talent and succession planning gaps can 
negatively impact the organization
Several initiatives are underway 
to make the company an 
employer of choice including 
well-designed HR policies 
healthy work environment, job  
rotation and other initiatives for 
retaining talent.

Innovation 
and R&D
Opportunity

process of purchasing or sourcing 
products, services or resources becomes 
unreliable.
Our procurement policy has 
several levels of checks which 
assure the quality of the 
product, vendor and the risks 
associated. We constantly 
strive to procure sustainably.
Negative

Water
Risk
Water, particularly high-quality water, 
is critical to our operations; hence, we 
recognized the need to comprehend the 
predicted changes in water stress and 
water-related risks.

management strategy that 
focuses on lowering water 
intensity and increasing the 
percentage of recycled water in 
our operations.

This 
Business 
Responsibility 
and 
Sustainability 
Report 
(BRSR) 
provides 
comprehensive insights into the company’s standalone operations. We strive to 
enhance transparency in our disclosures.
Our ongoing ESG journey is integral to our identity as a responsible corporate citizen, 
driving us to embed sustainability agenda with our company’s business objectives 
while recognizing ESG as a pivotal driver for long-term value creation across all 
stakeholders
In doing so we recognize we will need to address a few challenges both internal 
and external. As a highly regulated industry our ability to me swift significant 
changes are limited. In addition to significant capital investments for ESG initiatives, 
governmental policies and incentives can play a catalyst role in certain transition 
such as in the case of renewable sources.
From a societal perspective, we actively engage in healthcare, women 
empowerment, rural development, education and skill enhancement through our 
social impact projects. Our commitment extends to upholding high standards of 
corporate governance, transparency, accountability, and ethical conduct across our 
operations

ethical business practices, such as respecting data 
privacy, intellectual property rights, fair competition, and 
ensuring safe operating conditions for all workers. Our

Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim 
your products for reusing, recycling, and disposing 
at the end of life, for (a) Plastics (including 
packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and 
(d) other waste. 
	
We have established the standard operating procedure 
for Hazardous, Non-Hazardous waste and general 
waste Management is in place.  
 
Hazardous Waste Management:
Our company generates various types of hazardous 
waste, including evaporation salt, process salt, spent 
carbon, ETP sludge, insulation waste, spent mixed 
solvents, used oil, and PPE. Non-hazardous waste 
includes plastic, paper, glass, and empty drums, which 
are responsibly managed through recycling or co-
processing with approved recyclers.
14
NEULAND LABORATORIES LIMITED
Hazardous waste management strictly follows the 
Hazardous Waste Management Rules of 2016. We 
ensure proper collection and containment using MS 
drums or double-layer polythene bags, clearly labelled 
for identification. Only trained personnel handle 
hazardous waste to maintain safety and control.
We employ co-processing in cement kilns as an 
environmentally sustainable option for disposing of 
various wastes, including hazardous ones. This method 
not only destroys the waste at high temperatures (up 
to 1450°C) but also incorporates the inorganic content 
into the clinker, leaving no residues. Co-processing 
also neutralizes acidic gases within the kiln's alkaline 
environment and reduces the need for non-renewable 
resources like coal and limestone.
Our waste management system aims to achieve zero 
waste in landfills by maximizing reuse and recycling. 
In FY23, we successfully eliminated landfill waste, 
redirecting 100% of it towards co-processing and 
recycling initiatives. The co-processed waste is 
effectively utilized as fuel in cement kilns.
 
E-Waste Management:
Managing e-waste responsibly is crucial due to its 
hazardous nature and potential environmental and 
health risks. Our measures include:
E-Waste Collection Programs: Implementing collection 
programs within our facilities to ensure proper disposal 
of obsolete or broken electronic equipment.
E-Waste Recycling: Partnering with certified e-waste 
recycling facilities to dismantle devices, separate 
components, and safely dispose of hazardous substances.
Reuse and Refurbishment: Refurbishing and reusing 
functional electronic equipment within the organization.
Proper Disposal of Hazardous Materials: Safely 
disposing of hazardous materials like lead, mercury, 
cadmium, 
and 
brominated 
flame 
retardants 
in 
compliance with regulations.
Compliance with E-Waste Regulations: Adhering 
to 
local 
and 
international 
e-waste 
regulations, 
including 
collection, 
recycling, 
disposal, 
and 
reporting requirements.
Vendor Selection and Due Diligence: 
Carefully 
selecting and vetting e-waste recycling vendors to 
ensure they meet environmental and safety standards.
Employee 
Training 
and 
Awareness: 
Educating 
employees on proper e-waste disposal and its 
environmental and health impacts.
E-Waste Reporting and Tracking: Maintaining records 
of e-waste generated, collected, and disposed of for 
compliance and reporting purposes.
 
Plastic and Other Waste Management:
We have established recycling programs to capture 
and recycle materials such as plastic, paper, glass, and 
metals. Additionally, we invest in resource recovery 
technologies to extract value from waste streams 
through processes such as composting, anaerobic 
digestion, and material recovery.
By 
implementing 
these 
measures, 
we 
ensure 
responsible 
e-waste 
management, 
minimize 
environmental and health risks, and contribute to the 
circular economy by promoting the reuse and recycling 
of electronic materials.
4.	
Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) 
is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes / No). 
If yes, whether the waste collection plan is in line 
with the Extended  Producer Responsibility (EPR) 
plan submitted to Pollution Control Boards? If not, 
provide steps taken to address the same.
Not applicable, however, Neuland has registered 
for Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) as an 
importer and has secured approval from the Pollution 
Control Board (PCB). The annual returns for FY24 have 
been submitted.
Leadership Indicators  :
1.	
Has the entity conducted Life Cycle Perspective/Assessments (LCA) for any of its products (for manufacturing 
industry) or for its services (for service industry)? If yes, provide details in the following format?
No Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was conducted on any products. We plan to conduct LCAs for our specific products in 
the upcoming years.
2.	
If there are any significant social or environmental concerns and/or risks arising from production or disposal 
of your products / services, as identified in the Life Cycle Perspective/Assessments (LCA) or through any 
other means, briefly describe the same along-with action taken to mitigate the same.
There are no significant environmental or social concerns identified in our operations. We have procedures and 
systems in place to effectively mitigate risks, including robust waste management practices and adherence to circular 
economy principles.

safety culture through platforms such as Safety 
Committee Meetings and safety awareness sessions, 
encouraging employee participation and feedback.
Pre-employment and periodic medical check-ups, 
coupled with health awareness sessions and vaccination

workforce. Additionally, personalized employee care, 
including individual health records and counselling, 
ensures that employees at high risk of adverse medical 
situations receive appropriate support and attention.
13.	 Number of complaints on the following made by employees
Strict enforcement of safety regulations and guidelines 
is one of the primary measures taken to address

conducted to ensure compliance. Training programs 
are also implemented to educate employees on safety 
practices, raising awareness about potential workplace 
hazards and providing them with necessary skills to 
prevent accidents and injuries.
Incident reporting systems are in place to encourage 
employees to report safety concerns promptly, facilitating 
prompt investigation and resolution of issues before they 
escalate. In cases where significant risks are identified, 
proactive measures such as thorough risk assessments, 
additional safety protocols, provision of personal 
protective 
equipment 
(PPE), 
or 
facility/equipment 
modifications are implemented to mitigate these risks.

10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy 
adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes 
and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
Our company has implemented a comprehensive standard operating procedure for the management of hazardous, 
non-hazardous, and general waste. Hazardous waste, including various materials such as evaporation salt, process 
salt, spent carbon, and others, is managed in strict compliance with the Hazardous Waste Management Rules of 2016. 
We employ proper collection and containment methods, utilizing MS drums or double-layer polythene bags labeled 
for identification, and only trained personnel handle hazardous waste to ensure safety and control. Co-processing in 
cement kilns is utilized as an environmentally sustainable option for disposing of hazardous waste, effectively reducing 
landfill usage and maximizing reuse and recycling efforts. In FY23, we successfully diverted all landfill waste towards 
co-processing and recycling initiatives, contributing to our goal of achieving zero waste in landfills.
Additionally, our company prioritizes responsible e-waste management through various measures, including 
e-waste collection programs, recycling partnerships, employee training, and compliance with regulations. We also 
have established recycling programs for plastic, paper, glass, and metals, alongside investing in resource recovery 
technologies to extract value from waste streams. These initiatives collectively ensure environmentally responsible 
waste management practices while contributing to the circular economy and minimizing environmental and health risks 
associated with waste disposal.
All waste management practices are firmly established within our organization, guided by the principle of "wealth from 
waste," with the overarching aim of achieving zero waste in landfills while maximizing reuse and recycling. Our strategy 
ensures that all co-processing waste is directed to the cement industry for utilization as fuel in kilns. Hazardous waste 
generated in our processes, such as Evaporation Salt, Process Salt, Spent Carbon, and others, is meticulously managed, 
while non-hazardous waste, including plastic, paper, glass, and empty drums, undergoes recycling or co-processing. 
We collaborate with approved recyclers for the disposal of various waste types, including plastic, paper, glass, waste oil, 
and E-waste. Biomedical waste is appropriately handled through incineration.

for zero waste in landfills while maximizing reuse and recycling efforts. Hazardous waste, including various materials 
like Evaporation Salt, Process Salt, and Spent Carbon, is carefully managed, while non-hazardous waste undergoes 
recycling or co-processing. We collaborate with approved recyclers for responsible disposal, ensuring compliance with 
regulations and environmental standards.
Furthermore, we implement a Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) mechanism across all our facilities, ensuring that wastewater 
generated undergoes treatment and is reused in utility harvesting processes. This approach not only minimizes our 
environmental footprint but also promotes efficient resource utilization.
In addition to waste management, our environmental initiatives encompass energy efficiency improvements, 
decarbonization of industry, afforestation and reforestation efforts, and public awareness and education campaigns. 
Through these measures, we strive to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, conserve natural resources, and mitigate 
environmental impacts.
Our commitment to environmental stewardship is reflected in our comprehensive approach to environmental management, 
as outlined in our standard operating procedures and policies. By integrating environmental considerations into our daily 
operations, we aim to contribute positively to the well-being of our planet and future generations.

Increased emissions were identified as a key impact of our procurement activities. To address this, the organization 
undertook a supply chain de-risking plan focused on decreasing geographical dependencies and shortening the supply 
chain, particularly in response to the pandemic and other global concerns. As part of this strategy, we developed an 
alternate Indian supplier for a key starting material for one of our beta-blocker drugs, in addition to our original Chinese 
vendor. This initiative resulted in a significant cost reduction due to the price decrease and process improvements by 
the Indian supplier. Additionally, this effort significantly reduced carbon emissions.
