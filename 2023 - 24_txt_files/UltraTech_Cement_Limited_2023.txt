and fuel is required for 
heating. CO2 is released 
from calcination of 
limestone and combustion 
of fuel, which lead to 
global warming. GHG 
emission may impact 
business continuity and 
cause business disruption. 
To mitigate the risk, 
the Company has 
set voluntary targets 
to reduce emissions 
by 27% and 69% for 
scope 1 and scope 
2, respectively, by 
2032 from 2017 as the 
base year, which SBTi 
validates.
The Company focuses 
on an enhanced 
circular economy, 100% 
energy transition, a 
new product portfolio, 
and exploring and 
piloting the CCU 
technologies through 
the GCCA consortium 
to find economical and 
technical viable options 
to achieve net Zero by 
2050.

b.	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a  routine and non-routine basis 
by the entity?
	
	
The Company conducts detailed hazard identification and risk assessment (HIRA). Risk score of routine as well as 
non-routine activity is calculated by multiplying assigned scores of exposure (E), Severity (S) and Probability (P). 
If the risk score is higher than tolerable limit considering existing control measures, additional control measures 
are applied based on hierarchy of control (elimination, substitution, engineering control, administrative control, 
and PPE in descending order). The aim is to ensure the reduction of all work-related risks to ALARP (as low as 
reasonably practicable). In addition to this, Company uses other tools like HAZOP, Bow-Tie etc. to conduct 
critical process-safety related hazard identification and risk assessment.
	
c.	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from  
such risks. (Y/N)
	
	
Yes. Workers are encouraged to report work-related hazards and unsafe conditions, if any, at various forums. 
They are also included in teams for conducting Hazard Identification & Risk Assessment and their inputs are 
considered while applying risk control measures. 
	
	
Moreover, with an aim to reach out to every person and make them aware that they can act as whistle blowers 
to save lives, an exclusive safety toll free number has been made available 24x7. This has acted as an effective 
deterrent against engaging in high-risk activities without taking requisite safety precautions. The concerns 
voiced are addressed keeping the caller’s identity anonymous.
	
d.	
Do the employees/ worker of the entity have access to non-occupational medical  and healthcare services?  
(Yes/ No)
	
	
Yes. Doctors and other health care service providers are available to cater to the non-occupational medical 
needs of employees and workers.

Safety and health of all working for and on behalf of the Company remains the most important focus area as the 
Company’s core belief is “Life is precious, and we care for it”. In addition to reinforcing life-saving rules, the Company 
adopted innovative solutions aided by advanced technologies for effective management of risks. As a result, 94% of 
the Units remained free from serious incidents and could maintain as low as 0.07 Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate 
(LTIFR). To ensure that the organizational objective of “Zero harm” gains momentum, several interventions have been 
driven that are pivoted on:
	
i)	
Manage critical risks.
	
ii)	
Extend engagement and care.
	
A plethora of interventions have been made under each of the above-mentioned focus areas to make workplaces 
safer. Please refer to the safety section of Management Discussion and Analysis.
	
To strengthen behavioural safety, following interventions have been initiated / planned:
	
•	
Visible Felt Leadership trainings conducted for new leaders. Total 5 sessions conducted covering 172 leaders. 
	
•	
Safety Incubation Centres (SIC) planned at 13 Units to improve quality of training for workers and front-line 
executives and ensure reduction of “at risk behaviours” through continuous monitoring at ground, proper 
analysis and initiating corrective measures. 
	
•	
Proactive consequence management strengthened to reduce unsafe behaviour.

all concerned and implement those to prevent recurrence of similar incidents. In addition, 3D-animated videos 
in English, Hindi and 8 regional languages on serious incidents are shown at Units to make employees and 
contractual workers clearly understand about how and why those happened so that they can take requisite 
precautions to avoid recurrence in future. Multiple posters and signage are displayed across sites.

social topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.
	
The Company’s Mission - To deliver superior value to our stakeholders on the four pillars of:
	
Sustainability | Innovation | Team Empowerment | Customer Centricity.
	
As a step in this direction, the Company engages with stakeholders as on ongoing process - be it investors; lenders; 	
analysts; shareholders; employees; customers; suppliers and other channel partners. 
	
This enables the Company to feel the pulse of stakeholders, their expectations, and aspirations. Feedback 
received during interactions with stakeholders are deliberated by the management team and implemented, where 
appropriate.

The Company is committed to driving sustainability. It is focusing on reducing the carbon emissions by several 
ways. The decarbonisation framework includes driving efficiency improvements, introducing new technologies for 
reducing carbon footprint, using alternative energy, recovering waste heat, increasing renewables in the energy mix, 
introducing green product continuously in the portfolio, adopting circularity, reducing water usage, and improving 
biodiversity. It also has effective community management and human rights management.
	
The Company benchmarks its sustainability practices with global players through Global Cement and Concrete 
Association (GCCA). As the founding member of the GCCA, the Company has played a pivotal role in launching 
GCCA’s India operations and exploring the new technology adoption possibilities.

Rural Development, under the able leadership of Mrs. Rajashree Birla. The key focus areas are education, healthcare, 
women-empowerment, sustainable livelihood, infrastructure, and social reform.
	
It follows a bottom-up approach for all social projects. All projects are planned in consultation with the community. 
The process involves interacting with them and understanding their challenges and issues. We interact with 
village panchayats and prepare a list of requirements based on in-depth focused discussions. Implementation and 
monitoring of a project is a mutual responsibility of the community and the team. Regular community stakeholder 
meetings are held to ensure appropriate implementation process is followed. Once the project achieves a status

Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan? Give details in 100 words/ web link.
	
The Company has a business continuity and robust disaster management plan thoroughly implemented at each 
Unit. Disaster management plan, health and safety protocols and adequate communication protocols during 
extreme weather events ensure safety at sites and minimize the impact on workforce. Annual weather forecasts are 
considered to mitigate risk of delays in sourcing of fuels due to natural calamities. Insurance coverage is in place 
to protect against damages to business assets or loss of materials in warehouses or transit due to extreme weather 
events.
	
The Company’s Units are spread across the country. If a manufacturing Unit faces business disruption or shutdown 
due to extreme weather events, alternative Units in other locations can serve the respective customer. Widespread 
logistics network with warehouses across different parts of the country enable flexibility in the Company’s operations 
and ensure business continuity.
6. 	 Disclose any significant adverse impact to the environment, arising from the value chain of the entity.  
What mitigation or adaptation measures have been taken by the entity in this regard?
	
The Company has vast integrated value chain extending from mines to packed cement bags with interconnected 
network of mines, suppliers, jetties, manufacturing units, railway yards, warehouses and network of dealers and 
retailers. Transportation, handling and storage of raw materials, fuels and other additives used in the process impact 
environment in negative ways. Such material tends to impact environment during cement manufacturing process 
too. 
	
The Company has continuously followed circularity principles and continues to work towards it. This helps us to 
be more sustainable in terms of low natural resource utilisation, save on the extraction, environmental impact of 
transportation on GHG and air pollution. We have able to utilize 33.64 million tonnes of recycled and alternative raw 
materials in cement production in FY 24 along with 100% fly ash utilisation from own power plants in cement making 
thus saving environment in a big way. 
	
We are committed to reduce our GHG emissions from our process and we have made significant process as compared 
to base year of 2017. Our net CO2 emission intensity has decreased from 632 kg/tonne of cementitious products 
(in 2017) to 556kg/tonne of cementitious products (12% reduction from base year) this year, which is in line with 
our target reducing 27% carbon intensity by 2032. This has been possible due large influx of Renewable energy to 
substitute the fossil fuel-based energy and optimization of our manufacturing process.
	
Transportation related environmental impact is a major point in our downstream operation. The Company is working 
to deploy electric trucks for the same which will nullify the environmental impacts in a large way.
	
The Company has also launched Sustainable supply chain framework and code of conduct for our suppliers in FY 24. 
This is aided by self-assessment questionnaire (SAQ) which is monitored by third party. Based on the responses in 
SAQ, corrective and preventive action plan is formulated with the supplier to minimize the impact on environment 
and biodiversity.
