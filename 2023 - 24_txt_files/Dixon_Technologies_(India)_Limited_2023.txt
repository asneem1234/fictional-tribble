The Company’s strategic blueprint

long-term vision culminates in a state-of-the-art 
Centre of Excellence (COE) that fosters both 
theoretical and practical learning.
The implementation of these skilling and 
engagement programs not only promotes 
comprehensive employee development but also 
ensures their retention. The Company takes pride 
in its Great Place to Work (GWP) certification, 
held for the past three years. This accolade 
underscores the remarkable organisational

Health and 
safety
Risk
In the realm of the workplace, the Company 
places paramount importance on the well-
being of its workforce. Given its operations 
in the electronics manufacturing sector, the 
safety of its employees is a critical concern.
The Company’s dedication to 
preserving workforce health and 
safety is evident in its record 
of zero accidents and LTIFR 
incidents in its operations.
The Company adopts 
a structured approach, 
striving for a workplace 
devoid of injuries and 
fatalities. It adheres to the 
5S methodology, proactively 
addressing and preventing 
health emergencies.
To counter potential hazards, 
employees are equipped with 
suitable safety gear within the 
factories. For example, in the 
lighting manufacturing unit, 
employees are provided with 
specialized goggles to protect 
their eyes from high-intensity 
lights.
The Company’s commitment 
to safety is further reinforced 
through a distinct occupational 
health and safety policy. 
This policy underscores the 
Company’s dedication to 
creating a safe and healthy work 
environment for its employees.
Positive 
Implications: 
Ensuring the 
health and safety 
of employees 
positively impacts 
the Company. 
Investing in Health 
and Safety to 
create a safe and 
healthy workplace 
promotes 
well being of 
employees and 
reduces risk 
of accidents 
and improves 
productivity. 
In case of any 
accidents, 
corrective actions 
are taken in the 
spot to avoid any 
future mishaps.

Energy 
Management 
and Emission 
Reduction
Opportunity The Company, acknowledging the significant 
role of greenhouse gas emissions in 
exacerbating climate change risks, has 
conscientiously implemented a range of 
measures to reduce its global greenhouse gas 
footprint.
In essence, the Company’s actions reflect 
a steadfast commitment to environmental 
stewardship, demonstrating its role as a 
responsible corporate citizen in the face of 
global climate challenges.
Since Company has been 
undertaking several initiatives 
to curb greenhouse gas 
emissions from its operations, 
it is less likely to pose any risk 
to the Company.
Key among these initiatives 
is the transition to renewable 
energy sources. This is 
exemplified by the installation 
of solar panels to meet energy 
needs, and the switch to more 
eco-friendly fuels, such as the 
replacement of High-Speed 
Diesel (HSD) with Piped 
Natural Gas (PNG).
Moreover, the Company 
regularly measures its 
greenhouse gas emissions 
against international 
standards, specifically ISO 
14064 Part 1 and ISO 14064 
Part 2. This commitment 
to sustainability is further 
extended to improving energy 
efficiency through similar 
strategies.
Positive 
Implications: 
Investing in 
emerging climate 
technologies 
may initially be 
expensive, yet 
the long-term 
returns promise 
significant 
economic, social, 
and environmental 
benefits.
4
Waste 
management
Opportunity Waste management is a critical issue for the 
Company. The improper handling of waste 
could lead to legal consequences, financial 
penalties, and damage to the Company’s 
reputation.
A significant portion of the waste generated 
by the Company’s operations is electronic 
waste (e-waste), which poses substantial risks. 
Inadequate management of this waste could 
result in environmental pollution, threatening 
the health and safety of humans and other 
living organisms.
In essence, the Company is acutely aware of 
the importance of effective waste management 
and is committed to implementing robust 
strategies to mitigate the potential hazards 
associated with waste, particularly e-waste. 
This commitment underscores the Company’s 
dedication to environmental stewardship and 
the well-being of all life forms.
Dixon Technologies (India) 
Limited takes a proactive 
approach to waste 
management. In partnership 
with authorized third-party 
vendors approved by Pollution 
Control Boards, the Company 
ensures the safe disposal of 
all waste, including e-waste 
and plastic waste.
The process begins with 
careful segregation at the 
source. For example, in the 
manufacturing facilities, 
designated bins are used for 
separate waste collection. 
The segregated waste is then 
recycled or safely disposed 
of by authorized waste 
collectors.
Negative 
Implications: 
Although 
partnering with 
a government-
certified recycler 
may incur costs, 
the resulting 
environmental and 
social advantages 
far outweigh these 
expenditures

In the mobile manufacturing 
division, no waste from the 
production process remains 
with the Company. All 
materials, including packaging 
waste, are returned to the 
client, who is then responsible 
for proper disposal. This 
approach underscores Dixon 
Technologies’ commitment to 
environmental responsibility 
and sustainable business 
practices.

Product 
Design and 
Innovation
Opportunity In the dynamic landscape of the electronics 
industry, new technologies continually emerge 
and existing ones becomes obsolete. This 
constant flux significantly transforms not only 
this sector but others as well.
To keep pace with these evolving needs, it is 
crucial to take proactive steps. These include 
consistently innovating product design and 
manufacturing processes to ensure they 
remain cutting-edge.
In line with this principle, Dixon has made 
considerable investments to bolster its 
Research and Development capabilities.

Supply chain 
management
Risk
In today’s globalized world, the supply chain 
has evolved into a complex and expansive 
network. A multitude of factors come into play 
to ensure a robust and disruption-free supply 
chain. These include geopolitical influences, 
logistical considerations, the quality, 
accessibility, and availability of materials, 
among others.
Therefore, it is of paramount importance 
to establish an effective supply chain 
management system. This system is not only 
crucial for the ongoing operations of the 
business but also plays a vital role in ensuring 
the business’s resilience in emergency 
situations. A well-managed supply chain can 
help the business navigate through unforeseen 
challenges, thereby contributing to its long-
term sustainability.
The Company recognizes the 
significance of establishing 
an efficient supply chain 
management system, 
understanding that an 
uninterrupted and seamless 
supply chain is crucial 
for sustaining business 
operations. 
Negative 
Implications: 
Disruptions in 
the supply chain 
can results in 
uncreased costs 
and loss of 
revenue. Non-
compliances on 
the part of the 
Company can 
attract penalties.

feasible and leveraging SAP 
technologies for inventory

in the mobile and laptop 
manufacturing sector, raw 
materials for the production 
process are provided by the 
customer, highlighting their 
responsibility in the supply 
chain.

Climate 
Action
Risk
The ramifications of this global phenomenon, 
including heatwaves, floods, and landslides, 
have become increasingly conspicuous, 
necessitating the implementation of regulatory 
measures.
The electronics industry, akin to various 
other sectors, is susceptible to the physical 
and transitional impacts of climate change. 
Recognizing the urgency of the situation, it 
is imperative for companies to proactively 
address these challenges.
To navigate through these complexities, the 
Company acknowledges the necessity to 
assess potential factors that could obstruct its 
operations. This strategic evaluation is crucial 
in ensuring the Company’s resilience and 
adaptability in the face of climate change.
Dixon believes that the first 
step towards improving 
lies with the assessment of 
where they currently stand. 
Therefore, Dixon has been 
considering conducting a 
climate risk assessment to 
clearly understand the impact 
of climate change on their 
operations. Dixon believes 
that this process will enable 
them in charting out effective 
mitigation strategies.
Negative 
Implications: 
In case of 
negligence 
towards climate 
change, the 
Company can 
face major 
challenges such 
as loss of revenue, 
brand value and 
Goodwill.
10
Human 
Rights
Risk
Human rights are universally inherent to 
every individual. The Company recognizes 
that the protection of these rights not only 
cultivates trust but also bolsters its standing 
among the public. On the flip side, any 
infringement of human rights could lead to 
legal consequences, potentially tarnishing the 
Company’s reputation.
Company has been 
continually working to ensure 
the proper the compliance 
with the relevant statutory 
laws and implementation of 
its policies. It understands 
that as society is evolving at 
a rapid pace, it will also have 
to evolve its practices to be 
at par with the best practices 
and create better working 
environment for the people.

Water 
management
Opportunity The Company sees it as an opportunity to 
improve its water efficiency and minimize its 
water costs.
Sewage Treatment Plants 
(STP) have been set up, RO 
water which is discharged is 
re-used in toilets, cleaning 
utensils etc. and the 
remaining water is used 
for gardening purposes. In 
some of our units, the treated 
water is also released in 
Municipal/ governmental 
sewage pipelines. Rain water 
harvesting have also been 
installed at various locations 
of the Company. Push Punch 
water taps have also been 
installed to ensure minimum 
wastage.
Positive 
Implications 
Measures to 
reduce and 
conserve water 
would optimise

nurturing a robust relationship with its 
customers is the cornerstone for enduring 
business stability and expansion. This belief 
underscores the Company’s commitment to 
customer-centric practices, recognizing their 
pivotal role in driving business success. The 
Company, therefore, places immense value 
on cultivating strong customer relationships, 
viewing it as an essential strategy for 
sustainable growth and prosperity. This 
approach not only enhances customer 
satisfaction but also contributes significantly to 
the Company’s ongoing development.

Biodiversity 
management
Opportunity The Company recognizes biodiversity as a key 
asset, largely unaffected by its operations. It 
prides itself on the strategic placement of its 
factories, none of which are located within or 
in proximity to government-protected areas. 
The Company’s business strategy is explicitly 
designed to avoid the establishment of 
factories in protected or world heritage sites, 
underscoring its commitment to preserving 
biodiversity. This approach results in a minimal 
impact on biodiversity, demonstrating the 
Company’s dedication to environmental 
stewardship and sustainable practices. Thus, 
the Company’s operations and biodiversity 
exist in a harmonious balance, each minimally 
affecting the other. This commitment not only 
reflects the Company’s corporate responsibility 
but also its respect for the natural world.
Positive 
Implications
By improving 
efficiency and 
complying with 
rules, regulations 
and guidelines 
and adopting 
biodiversity 
management 
practices, 
the Company 
can improve 
its financial 
performance and 
market standing.

Data security 
and privacy
Risk
The Company is acutely aware that improper 
data management can lead to substantial 
regulatory consequences and tarnish its 
reputation. In response to this, the Company 
has been proactive in enhancing its 
information technology system. A testament 
to this commitment is the Company’s pursuit 
of ISO 27001 certification for its IT system. 
This internationally recognized standard 
underscores the Company’s dedication to 
maintaining the highest level of data security 
and integrity. Thus, the Company not only 
acknowledges the potential risks associated 
with data mismanagement but also takes 
tangible steps to mitigate them, thereby 
safeguarding its reputation and regulatory 
compliance.
Company has formulated and 
implemented data privacy 
policy and also has been 
strengthening information 
security system. The Company 
has been on a regular basis 
monitoring their softwares 
and framing stringent policies 
for cyber security. The 
Company has implemented 
access control and IPS/IDS 
in firewall which reduced the 
risk of unwanted access and 
hacking.
This will have 
positive financial 
implications on 
the Company 
as it will prevent 
data breaches 
and other 
cybersecurity 
related risks

Principle 2: Business should provide goods and services in a manner that is 
sustainable and safe
SDG
Dixon Technologies demonstrates a strong commitment to sustainability 
across its operations. Although the Company lacks a formal sustainable 
procurement strategy, its consistent integration of sustainable sourcing 
principles speaks to its dedication. Dixon excels in waste management by 
complying with regulations and partnering with authorized recyclers for safe 
disposal. All manufacturing facilities operate as Zero Waste to Landfill (ZWL). 
The Company acknowledges Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) and 
aligns waste collection with regulatory requirements. While formal Life Cycle 
Assessments haven’t been conducted, Dixon remains steadfast in mitigating

some of the leading companies in the electronics industry. During these operations, various types of waste, 
such as plastic and electronic waste, are generated. Dixon Technologies has established partnerships 
with authorized third-party recyclers, like Greeniva Recycler and other waste recyclers, to safely dispose of 
processing waste. However, since the Company operates in the B2B segment, the provision of reclaiming 
products is not applicable.
All manufacturing facilities of Dixon Technologies are Zero Waste to Landfill (ZWL), demonstrating the 
Company’s commitment to sustainable practices and reducing its environmental impact. It’s reassuring to 
note that any waste generated at the factories is securely disposed of, and disposal agencies approved by
