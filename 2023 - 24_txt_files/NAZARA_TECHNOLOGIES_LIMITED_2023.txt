term value for shareholders, maintain 
its reputation, and comply with legal 
and regulatory requirements.

damaged reputation. Furthermore, incidents that 
raise ethical concerns, even if not regulatory, can 
also harm the Company’s reputation.
2.
Data Privacy
Risk
Data privacy is vital for the Company 
as 
it 
helps 
uphold

obligations, and safeguard against

3.
Regulatory 
Approvals

Retention 
Risk and 
Opportunity
The Company should foster a positive 
work 
environment 
emphasising 
employee development, competitive 
salaries, benefits, and a culture 
of innovation. This approach will 
enhance 
talent 
attraction 
and 
retention, driving long-term success 
and growth. However, challenges in 
retaining key employees could result 
in the loss of crucial knowledge and 
expertise, potentially hindering the

encouraging workplace
Employee Development: Emphasise opportunities for 
professional growth and skill development

and 
Well-Being
Risk
Prioritising employee safety and

as employees are its most valuable 
asset. To ensure this, the Company 
actively evaluates and manages 
health and safety risks across all 
operations.
Safety as a Priority: Establish safety as a fundamental 
requirement across all operations
Health and Well-Being Measures: Implement various 
initiatives to support employee health
Health Awareness Programmes: Conduct programmes to 
raise awareness about health and wellness
Positive
Focussing on employee health, safety, and 
well-being can benefit the Company financially 
by lowering accident and illness-related costs, 
boosting 
productivity 
and 
profitability, 
and 
enhancing talent attraction and retention.

efficient sources

Risk & 
Opportunity
If the Company fails to prioritise 
customer needs and preferences, it 
may result in decreased satisfaction, 
pushing customers to competitors 
and 
reducing 
market 
share. 
Conversely, 
by 
ensuring 
clear,

communications

Positive
Customer satisfaction and loyalty can significantly 
boost profitability and open up better business 
opportunities, contributing to financial growth.
Negative
Losing customers can reduce market share and 
revenue, while customer dissatisfaction can harm 
the Company’s reputation.
9
Waste 
Management
Risk
The rapid growth of the gaming 
industry 
has 
had 
notable 
environmental impacts, including 
reliance on mined metals and plastic 
in electronics, substantial energy 
use for game consoles, and rising 
concerns relating to e-waste.
Reduce Plastic Waste: Implement measures to minimise 
plastic waste
Promote Recyclable Paper: Encourage the use of 
recyclable paper products
Visual Aids: Use visual aids to promote and support waste 
management practices
Replace PET Bottles: Transition away from PET plastic bottles

Statement by the director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting 
ESG-related challenges, targets and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding 
the placement of this disclosure)
Nazara Technologies, a leading company in gaming and sports media, is dedicated to 
conducting business in a responsible and sustainable manner, fully aligning our actions 
with Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) responsibilities. We have implemented 
various environmental initiatives designed to minimise waste and enhance recycling 
efforts. These initiatives encompass the adoption of energy efficient technologies, the 
utilisation of cloud servers for data storage, the implementation of advanced water 
management systems, and active tree plantation efforts.
In our special sphere, we prioritise customer satisfaction, diversity, equality, ethical 
conduct, and community involvement. Our firm commitment to these values undercores 
our effort to make a positive impact on both society and our stakeholders as we strive 
to create a positive impact on society and our stakeholders.
Maintaining effective communication with investors and shareholders is integral to 
our corporate governance practices. We recognise that ethical business conduct, 
efficient and transparent customer service, robust corporate governance, diligent risk 
management, and human capital development are key ESG issues. To address these, 
we have implemented several measures, including a Comprehensive Code of Conduct 
and Business Ethics, the promotion of a sound risk culture, the introduction of innovative 
products, investment in cybersecurity and information security, and the development of 
comprehensive employee welfare policies. Additionally, we closely monitor resource 
consumption and have established targets to reduce electricity, fuel, and paper usage.
Our achievements in these areas reflect our commitment to ESG principles. However, 
we acknowledge that ongoing challenges persist. The dynamic nature of environmental 
concerns, rapid technological advancements, and evolving stakeholder expectations 
entail continuous adaptation and refinement of our strategies.
In conclusion, Nazara Technologies remains dedicated to sustainability and responsible 
business practices. We will continue to strive towards achieving our ESG targets and 
addressing challenges proactively, ensuring that our actions deliver benefits to not only 
the Company but also the broader community and environment.
