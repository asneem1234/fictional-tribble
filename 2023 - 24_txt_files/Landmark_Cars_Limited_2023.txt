Energy 
Management
Risk
Businesses in this sector 
necessitate substantial 
energy usage for their 
warehouse operations. 
With the rise of regulations 
targeting greenhouse gas 
emissions (GHG Emissions) 
and incentives promoting 
energy efficiency and 
renewable resources, 
traditional electricity 
costs may escalate, while 
alternative energy sources 
become more cost-
competitive.
Decisions regarding 
energy sourcing often 
involve balancing costs 
and operational reliability, 
presenting trade-offs. 
Consequently, the effective 
management of overall 
energy efficiency and the 
availability of alternative 
energy sources are 
becoming more crucial for 
organisations. At present, 
we are in the early stages 
of negotiations with a small 
group of suppliers concerning 
the shift towards renewable 
energy. The Company is 
exploring the installation of 
rooftop solar panels with 
these suppliers.
Negative
*There were no 
negative financial 
impact in the  
FY 2023-24
2.
Labour 
Practices
Risk
Maintaining cordial labour 
relations is a challenge in 
the industry in which the 
Company operates. High 
workforce turnover rate 
due to comparatively lower 
average wage is a growing 
risk in this industry. Since 
customers regularly interact 
directly with retail employees, 
entities may experience 
decreased market share 
and revenue from negative 
consumer sentiment because 
of poor labour relations.
Landmark understands that 
adopting sound Labour 
practices and taking 
measures to improve labour 
productivity can improve our 
reputation, reduce cost of 
capital and help us mitigate 
this risk. The Company 
strives to take measures in 
terms of employee welfare 
and employee engagement 
activities to ensure the same.

Employee 
Engagement, 
Diversity & 
Inclusion
Opportunity
The Company operates in 
consumer-facing industries 
and depends on effective 
communication with 
customers throughout the 
sales process, as well as the 
ability to adjust to evolving 
consumer preferences. With 
significant demographic 
changes occurring in 
many developed markets, 
businesses in this sector 
stand to gain. Due to the 
Company’s commitment to an 
equal-opportunity workplace 
policy, it can effectively adapt 
to demographic shifts and 
hire a diverse workforce 
capable of comprehending 
the needs of different 
populations. This strategy 
enables us to better serve 
large segments of society, 
giving the Company a 
competitive edge.

4.
Data Security
Risk
The Company’s dependence 
on digital platforms exposes 
it to potential disruptions or 
failures in technology for 
various reasons, including 
software or hardware 
malfunctions, system 
implementations or upgrades, 
computer viruses, third-
party security breaches, 
employee errors, misuse, 
power disruptions, and other 
factors. These events could 
cause significant interruptions 
in operations, resulting in 
corresponding revenue and 
profit losses.
We are consistently 
committed to strengthening 
our digital infrastructure by 
implementing strong technical 
protections and closely 
monitoring both emerging 
and current threats. Our main 
priority is to reduce data 
security risks and minimise 
any potential impact on 
our operations. Through 
proactive measures to tackle 
these challenges, we aim to 
uphold a secure and resilient 
environment for our Company 
and its stakeholders.
Negative
*There were no 
negative financial 
impact in the

Restrictions 
imposed by 
OEMs
Risk
The Company is heavily 
affected by the considerable 
influence and limitations 
imposed by Original 
Equipment Manufacturers 
(OEMs) as per the terms 
of our dealership or 
agency agreements. These 
conditions could negatively 
affect our business, financial 
performance, and prospects, 
including our capacity to 
enter new markets and obtain 
additional dealerships.
As an authorised agent 
for Mercedes-Benz, our 
operations are influenced 
significantly by restrictions 
and agreements entered 
into with Original Equipment 
Manufacturers (OEMs) 
and vendors and subject to 
dealership terms we strive 
to ensure to arrive at mutual 
decisions causing minimum 
impact of the risk identified.
