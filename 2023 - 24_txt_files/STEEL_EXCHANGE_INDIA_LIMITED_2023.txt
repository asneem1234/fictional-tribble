Employee turnover is a crucial metric for measuring the performance of human resources departments or human resource management apps. 
High turnover means that many people are leaving the company, while low turnover means that people tend to stay in their jobs longer. The employee 
turnover rate is a way to measure how often employees leave a company and are replaced by new ones. 
Analyzing turnover rates can help organizations identify areas for improvement in terms of employee engagement, retention strategies, and overall 
workplace culture. It can also be used to compare turnover rates within different departments or industries, providing insights into the relative health and 
stability of different work environments.

2. 
a. 
Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No) 
The steel industry is one of the largest carbon emitters globally, and while research and development efforts are underway to decarbonize the 
steelmaking process, these technologies have not yet matured for large-scale commercial operations. Given this, sustainably sourcing input raw 
materials, which are major contributors to carbon emissions, remains a significant challenge. Despite this, the Company is underway and 
collaborating with selected suppliers to ensure sustainable sourcing of key input materials. 
b. 
If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably? 
Zero. 
The Company is in the process of setting up mechanisms to follow and track this data digitally. 
3. 
Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of life, for (a) Plastics 
(including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste. 
Steel has a very long service life before it needs to be recycled. End-of-life steel or scrap steel is not considered as waste product by the Company, 
instead used as input product by remelting. The Company is committed to circularity and reuses scrap generated during the production process. 
Further 
the steel slag generated during the production is sold to cement manufacturers which helps in reducing the emission intensity of cement 
production. 
4. 
Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity's activities (Yes / No). If yes, whether the waste collection 
plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to Pollution Control Boards? If not, provide steps taken 
to address the same.
