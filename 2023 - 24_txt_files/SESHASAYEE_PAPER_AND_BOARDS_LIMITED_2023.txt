2.	 Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues
	
Please indicate material responsible business conduct and sustainability issues pertaining to 
environmental and social matters that present a risk or an opportunity to your business, rationale 
for identifying the same, approach to adapt or mitigate the risk along-with its financial implications, 
as per the following format.

Financial 
implications 
of the risk or 
opportunity
1
Printing and writing 
paper segment which 
is the prime grade 
among company's 
products, is expected 
to be negatively 
impacted in the near 
future.
Opportunity 
& Risk
Risk: 
Will affect the margins business that 
the Company operates.
Opportunity:
(i)	 Provides opportunity to diversify 
in to other product range to cater 
to different segments of markets.
(ii)	 To take advantage of restrictions 
on single use plastic materials, 
by developing alternatives.
The Company has been making 
necessary investments to diversify 
its product range and has also been 
strengthening its marketing network, 
as well as the supply chain.
Adverse 
since 
margins of 
alternate 
grades are 
likely to be 
lower when 
compared 
with printing 
and writing 
segment.
2
Failure of Monsoon 
and absence of water 
flow in the River from 
where the Company 
draws its water 
requirements
Risk
Risk: Since water shortage will 
directly disrupt the pulp and paper 
production.
The Company is taking various 
initiatives to curtail quantum of fresh 
water used in the process.

Financial 
implications 
of the risk or

3
Wood availability
Risk
Risk: Since wood pulp constitutes 
the major portion in the pulp furnish 
of the paper manufacturing in the 
Company.
The Company has well defined tree 
farming strategy to enable marginal 
land owners in nearby districts to 
grow trees in about 20000 acres 
annually. This enables Company to 
be wood positive.
This risk is further addressed thro’ a 
4 pronged strategy :
-	
Adding Newer species of wood to 
its raw material base
-	
Enhancing the sourcing of wood 
from regions outside Tamil Nadu
-	
Direct connect with Farmers thro’ 
Contract Farming initiatives
-	
Enhancing usage of bagasse 
& 
deinked 
pulp 
to 
reduce 
dependency on wood pulp.
Negative 
since 
shortage of 
wood will 
result in 
company 
resorting 
to use of 
costlier 
sourced pulp.
4
Dependency 
on 
Imported Coal
Opportunity 
& Risk
Risk: Since this results in increase in 
energy cost.
Opportunity: Since this opens up 
avenues to move towards non-fossil 
fuel based energy sources.
The company has continuously taken 
steps to reduce its dependency on 
Coal.
Today, 61% of the energy needs of 
the Unit : Erode is addressed thro’ 
renewable 
energy 
sources 
and 
bio-fuels. Further steps are being 
taken 
to 
increase 
the 
share 
by 
augmenting 
 
in-house 
pulp 
production.
Neutral 
since the 
company’s 
dependency 
on Coal has 
come down.

5
Monsoon failures 
affecting the Sugar 
Industry thereby 
restricting the supply 
of Bagasse
Risk
Risk: Since Bagasse is a key input 
material for the company.
The Company has its own Captive 
source with Bagasse sourced from 
Associate Company. The Bagasse 
production by the Associate Company 
is more than the material required by 
SPB.
Neutral since 
bagasse 
represents 
only about 
10% of the 
pulp mix 
in Erode 
operations.

As can be seen from the above, the three primary fibrous raw materials viz. Wood, Sugar cane 
Bagasse and Waste Paper are obtained through a sustainable process model helping the local 
community.  
• 
The paper manufacturing process adopted by our company is also environmentally friendly and 
green. Our process is energy efficient and totally “Elemental Chlorine Free”. Our process uses 
environmentally friendly chemicals viz. Oxygen, Hydrozen Peroxide, Chlorine Di-oxide, etc. which 
make our process green.  The process adapted by our company generates a liquor called “Black 
Liquor” which is a biomass rich in lignin is burnt in a boiler to produce green power.
• 
Nearly 70% of the energy consumed by Unit : Erode is green power generated from ‘Black Liquor’ 
in the Chemical Recovery Complex and bio-fuels used in our Power Boilers.  Nearly 96% of the 
Chemicals used in pulping process are recovered back in the Chemical Recovery Complex and 
recycled.

for hundreds of small board manufacturers and the board produced is used for Egg tray, Hosiery 
packing, Footwear packing, etc.
• 
Our company has a unique waste water treatment facility.  The waste water from the Mill is classified 
into three categories viz. (i) High COD, (ii) Medium COD & (iii) Low COD.  
• 
The high COD stream is taken to Anaerobic Lagoon which generates Methane gas which is used in 
Rotary Lime Kiln to replace fossil fuel viz. Furnace Oil.
• 
The low COD stream is taken to Clarifier and is recycled back in the process.
• 
The medium COD stream is treated in the waste water treatment facility meeting the standards 
prescribed by the Pollution Control Board and the treated waste water is used for irrigating the waste 
land around the Mill through Lift Irrigation Scheme.
•

Our company is constantly focused on identifying new wood species.  Recently the company 
has identified newer varieties of wood like Melia-Dubia and Subabul as wood suitable for pulp 
production.
Technical support to the farmers for this initiative is being provided in association with 
the Department of Tree Breeding of Forest College and Research Institute, attached to 
Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Coimbatore, through a Collaborative Research Project.
Our company has a structured, innovative Lift Irrigation Scheme by which our treated waste 
water is used to irrigate nearly 1500 acres of land in which local farmers grow sugar cane. The 
sugar cane produced is procured by our associate Company viz. Ponni Sugars(Erode) Limited 
which in turn gives bagasse, a residue left after extraction of sugar from sugar cane.  Bagasse 
is used by our Company to produce paper, and in turn, our Company gives treated waste water 
to the farmers to grow sugar cane.  This tripartite arrangement between our Company, Ponni 
Sugars (Erode) Limited and the nearby Farmers has been in operation for over 35 years. This 
innovative Lift Irrigation Scheme is a unique and innovative irrigation scheme and has caught 
the attention of Overseas Experts and UNDP as a Role Model.

• 
The Company’s unit in Erode is an integrated pulp and paper mill. The practice of ZLD has not 
been achieved in any integrated pulp and paper mill so far (Reference :Central Pulp & Paper 
Research Institute (CPPRI), Saharanpur, report on the subject).
• 
However, the company, in its Erode unit, has a structured, innovative Lift Irrigation Scheme 
by which our treated waste water is used to irrigate nearly 1500 acres of land in which local 
farmers grow sugar cane. The sugar cane produced is procured by our associate Company 
viz. Ponni Sugars(Erode) Limited which in turn gives bagasse, a residue left after extraction 
of sugar from sugar cane.  Bagasse is used by our Company to produce paper, and in turn, 
our Company gives treated waste water to the farmers to grow sugar cane.  This tripartite 
arrangement between our Company, Ponni Sugars (Erode) Limited and the nearby Farmers 
has been in operation for over 35 years. This innovative Lift Irrigation Scheme is a unique and 
innovative irrigation scheme and has caught the attention of Overseas Experts and UNDP as 
a Role Model.
