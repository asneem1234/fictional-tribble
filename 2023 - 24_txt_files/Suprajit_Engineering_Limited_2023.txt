No. We do not have ZLD as our operations are not water intensive. STP has been set up in Units where the treated water is used 
for gardening purposes. One Unit is handing over the used water to GIDC pipeline in accordance to the State Govt Guidelines. 
One Unit is handing over the STP water to Govt approved CETP pipelines thus abiding by the State Pollution Control Board 
norms. All other Units have in house STP facilities Thus there is no external discharge outside the plant boundary.
