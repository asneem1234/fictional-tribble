A brief on types of customers
The Company serves a diverse set of customers as mentioned below:
• 
Dealers: The Company appoints dealers in the markets and sells cement through them. Dealers further sell cement to 
retailers and end consumers. Retailers thereafter sell cement and service the demand of retail customers. Dealers place 
orders on the warehouse / plant and supplies are made accordingly. The Company gives discounts / incentives to the 
dealers both monetary and in kind which are linked to their targets.
• 
Retailers: The Company appoints retailers in the market to whom dealers sell cement. The retailers operate counters 
(sale outlet) and they service the demand of retail customers in vicinity of their location. Majorly, dealers while placing 
orders on Company specify the Retailer rm to whom the cement is to be delivered (Ship-to-party). The Company also 
offers discount schemes to retailers to promote its products and create brand pull from customers. 
• 
As part of its institutional sales (non-trade) strategy, Company directly sells to customers depending on their order, size 
and location. These customers can be Real Estate developers, Infrastructure companies or government departments 
who consume cement for civil construction activities. Such orders could either be procured directly by company ofcials 
or initiated by commission agents. In either case the billing is done by the company directly to the customers. 
• 
In order to support its sales & marketing activities, the Company deploys a team of sales personnel for generating 
business from the dealers and direct customers and gather market information. The Company also deploys customer 
service executives to provide technical guidance to end users. The Company uses various modes of advertising for sales 
promotion and brand building.

Overview of the entity's material responsible business conduct issues 
 
 
Please indicate material responsible business conduct and sustainability issues pertaining to environmental and 
social matters that present a risk or an opportunity to your business, rationale for identifying the same, approach to 
adapt or mitigate the risk along with its nancial implications, as per the following format:
Emissions management is a material risk for any  
manufacturing enterprise due to its potential 
impacts on regulatory compliance, reputation, 
nancial performance, and operational continuity. 
Inadequate management can lead to regulatory 
penalties, reputational damage, increased costs, 
and disruptions, making it a critical concern in an 
environmentally conscious and regulated 
landscape.
 Limestone constitutes a primary raw material in  
cement production and necessitates fossil fuel for its 
combustion during the manufacturing process.  
As a result of this process, CO  emissions are 
2
generated through both the calcination of limestone  
and the fuel combustion. Such emissions potentially  
contribute to global warming, thereby exerting the  
potential to inuence business continuity and even  
precipitate disruptions.
 The Company is 
meticulously planning  
and implementing  various 
measures,  including 
transitioning  to renewable 
energy  sources, 
increasing
 power generation from 
waste heat recovery 
generation system,  and 
investing in  alternative 
fuels handling  & storage 
facility to  increase 
Thermal Substitution Rate 
(TSR).  The above 
measures helps in 
reducing CO  emission

 The Company has recognized opportunities for  
reduction in carbon footprint and operational costs. 
Switching over from conventional power from  
thermal power plant to green power also helps to  
comply with Renewable Power Purchase Obligation  
(RPPO) mandated by the State Governments. 
 Prioritizing occupational health and safety  
measures can protect employees, reduce accidents,  
improve productivity, and enhance the company's  
reputation as a responsible employer. It also helps in 
attracting and retaining skilled manpower.
Non-compliance with health and safety regulations  
can have severe consequences for a company.  
Furthermore, workplace incidents and illnesses can 
affect productivity, inate expenses, and expose  
the company to legal liabilities. Moreover, such 
incidents can adversely affect employee morale,  
impact the company's culture, and make it  
challenging to retain skilled staff and attract new  
talent. The Company may also face reputational risk.
 Investing in community development programmes, 
such as rural infrastructure development, healthcare 
facilities and educational programs, benets the 
local community and also creates a positive impact 
on the Company's brand image. As a responsible 
corporate citizen, the Company strives to improve 
the standard of living of the beneciaries.
We are committed to support social and economic 
development of our neighbouring communities.

Heidelberg Materials Group has formulated Anti-Corruption Guidelines and the Company has adopted the same. One of 
the goals of the Heidelberg Materials Group’s compliance programme is to prevent corrupt behavior by Group companies 
and employees. Sections 2.3-2.5 of the Code of Business Conduct (“Anticorruption”, “Gifts, hospitality and benefits”, 
“Conflicts of interest”) set forth general anticorruption principles. This Guideline is part of the Group compliance 
programme and gives guidance to employees by providing additional details. The Guidelines apply to all companies of 
Heidelberg Materials Group. This Guideline not only prohibits corrupt practices punishable under relevant penal laws but 
also addresses conflict of interest issues and prohibits unethical behavior, even if such conduct is not a punishable 
criminal offence. This approach is based on the principle that it is important to avoid even the suggestion that a business or 
governmental decision might have been influenced by the acceptance or granting of an advantage, be it personal or for 
any third party. The Company has also implemented a Code of Conduct that requires the employees to act with high 
standards of personal and professional ethics, integrity and ensure strict compliance with the applicable laws. You can 
refer to the Code of Conduct-https://www.mycemco.com/sites/default/files/PDF/Policies/Code_of_Conduct.pdf

PRINCIPLE 2 - BUSINESSES SHOULD PROVIDE GOODS AND SERVICES IN A MANNER THAT IS SUSTAINABLE AND 
SAFE
Essential Indicators
1. Percentage of R&D and capital expenditure (capex) investments in specific technologies to improve the environmental 
and social impacts of product and processes to total R&D and capex investments made by the entity, respectively.
2 a. Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing?: Yes
 
 
The Company has systems in place for sustainable sourcing of materials and their transportation. Limestone is the 
primary raw material for manufacturing of cement. The Company uses latest mining techniques to stay cost effective 
in its operations and avoid wastage. The transportation of limestone from Patheria mines to Narsingarh Clinkerisation 
plant is done in a sustainable manner via 22 km long Overland Belt Conveyor (OLBC). Despite being capital intensive, 
OLBC has proven advantage over conventional road transportation when it comes to reducing carbon footprint and 
at the same time it reduces logistics cost. In order to optimize and thereby conserve Limestone, the Company has 
been producing blended cement only, i.e. producing more cement from every ton of clinker it produces. 
Consequently, the life of the mines is also getting extended. With a belief that sustainable transportation is attained 
through less polluting and fuel-efficient transportation mix, most of the inward transported bulk material are by rail 
and fuel-efficient transportation mix, most of the inward transported bulk material are by rail.
 
 
The Company has long term agreements with thermal power plants to ensure uninterrupted supply of fly ash. The 
Company ensures maximum consumption of fly ash including wet fly ash, to the extent possible within the 
permissible norms laid down by Bureau of Indian Standards.
 
b. If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?
 
 
For all the major purchases such as coal, petcoke, gypsum, fly ash, sweetener, and equipment spares and services 
are sourced sustainably. The Company utilizes the SAP-Ariba platform as the guided buying, sourcing, and 
contracting tool, enabling stakeholders to conduct their sourcing activities digitally. Additionally, the Company has 
implemented SAP ERP to ensure a robust procure-to-pay process for all purchases.
3. Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of 
life, for 
 
(a) Plastics (including packaging):  
 
 
The Company produces cement, which is packed in cement bags. These bags are frequently reused to store other 
construction material.
 
 
All the plastic bag procurement quantity are covered under EPR obligation. We are complying with EPR liability.
 
(b) E-waste:  
 
 
Our manufacturing process does not produce any e-waste, however, the e-waste produced in the office operations is 
sold to the registered recyclers.
 
(c) Hazardous waste:
 
 
The Hazardous waste generated in the cement production process, is sold to the registered recyclers or disposers. 
The incinerable fractions of the hazardous waste are disposed off within the plant kilns itself as per the permissions 
from State Pollution Control Board.
 
(d) Other waste: We are utilising hazardous waste as an alternative fuel and waste/by-products of other industries viz., 
fly ash, slag, pet coke and red mud as raw materials in our cement manufacturing process.
 
 
Other non-hazardous waste such as paper, wood, metal scrap etc. sold out to vendors on bidding basis.
4. Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity's activities. If yes, whether the waste 
collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to Pollution Control 
Boards? If not, provide steps taken to address the same.
 
Yes. Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the company and followed as per the plan submitted to the 
Pollution Control Board. Cement Bags get recycled during use phase multiple time to store various items. In addition, the 
company disposes off much higher quantities of plastic waste (from other industries and municipalities) as compared to 
the PP bags used by it in cement packaging.

basis by the entity?
 
 
For the maintenance of a secure cement plant environment, implementation of a comprehensive safety management 
system is pivotal. This system encompasses risk evaluation and control protocols for all processing activities, a 
meticulously structured permit system, the use of secure machinery, well-equipped firefighting systems, the upkeep 
of a clean workspace, regular safety audits, and a skilled and proficient workforce. Additionally, the Company

actions are taken. The initial response involves isolating the hazard to prevent any individuals from approaching it. 
The area is cordoned off, and the operational team is promptly notified to assess the situation and implement 
remedial and preventive measures within the specified timeframe. This ensures the safety of all workers and thereby 
mitigates the risks associated with work-related hazards.

adhere to health and safety programs and protocols. Each plant is equipped with a designated plant safety officer. While 
rare, process-related hazards may arise during operational periods, often resulting from inadvertent unsafe actions.
 
All manufacturing plants hold ISO 45001:2018 Occupational Health and Safety Management System certification, 
endorsed by TUV SUD South Asia Private Limited. External safety audits, overseen by TUV auditors, are conducted 
annually, supplemented by semi-annual internal audits. Furthermore, the Head of Safety conducts plant safety 
inspections across all facilities on  quarterly basis.
 
For any maintenance work, authorized employees are required to obtain a 'Permit to Work'. It's imperative that all 
equipment guards and protective measures are in place before closing the permit, as overlooking this step could lead to 
potential hazards.
 
To maintain the safety momentum and awareness throughout the year, the Company has adopted the following health 
and safety initiatives:
 
• A monthly safety gate meeting 
 
• A monthly safety theme and communication
 
• Once-a-four-month plant safety star award programme
 
• Strict adherence to safety cardinal rules 
 
• Safety zone system, hazard identification and risk assessment control measures
 
• Work permits and procedures
 
• Safety inspections and audits 
 
• Fire prevention and protection 
 
• Accident and near-miss incident reporting 
 
• Investigation to determine the root cause & Implementation of safety measures
 
If a near miss or other event occurs at any plant, the incident learnings are shared with all plants so that necessary 
corrective actions can be taken if a similar risky condition exists in any other plant. If any of the plant's safety cardinal rules 
are violated, a warning letter is given to the responsible engineer/manager to modify their behaviour and prevent the 
recurrence of such events in future.
 
There are "Safety Cardinal Rules" that must be followed by workers and contractors. To ensure the safety of employees, 
contractors and third parties, it is compulsory to wear the following Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) at all plants and 
comply with the following Cardinal Rules:
 
• All personal protective equipment (PPE) required for a specific task must be used correctly.
 
• Before performing any task, all equipment's are separated from intrinsic energy sources and inspected to verify that it
 
cannot start or move.
 
• Safeguards must be put in place before the equipment is started or resumed.
 
•  Competent people with work permit signed by the responsible superior could enter confined places.
 
• All workplace issues are reported and examined to determine the root cause and implement corrective actions and
 
lessons learnt.
 
• All drivers must follow driving norms in strict compliance with local laws and company regulations.
 
Further Health & Safety requirements are laid down in the Company's Group guidelines and local documents are 
available at the plant which are reviewed and revised. Non-compliance with these rules is viewed seriously in all plants.
 
The Company conducts its business in a way that cause no harm to the people with whom they work with, and 
endeavours to establish a healthy and safe working. With all these in place, senior leadership engagement and 
involvement ensures a safe and healthy workplace.

STAKEHOLDERS
Essential Indicators
1. Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity. 
 
The Company's stakeholder engagement process begins with defining objectives and scope and adopting the medium 
for engagement. This is followed by identifying and prioritising the internal and external stakeholders and conducting 
interaction with various stakeholders' groups such as Employees, Dealers, Retailers, Customers, Suppliers, 
Contractors, Other Service Providers, Regulatory Authorities, Shareholders, Investors, Analysts and Local 
Communities.
 
Throughout the course of the year, we maintain ongoing dialogue with the many stakeholders by utilising a variety of 
channels of contact. The process of engaging stakeholders also includes regular feedback and grievance redressal 
methods, both of which are vital components of the process.
 
This involvement helps us in understanding their viewpoint and put forth our perspective. On the basis of outcome of 
interaction, appropriate actions are taken in the interest of all the stakeholders. The insights that we gain from these 
discussions are helpful, because they allow us to continually enhance both our strategy and our operations.

4. Do you have a focal point (Individual/ Committee) responsible for addressing human rights impacts or issues 
caused or contributed to by the business?
 
Yes, The Company has in place a Policy Statement on Human Rights wherein the all the employees and workers of the 
Company are familiarized about ensuring of Human Rights based on UN Guiding Principles. Also, during Financial Year 
2023-24, the Company had conducted a Human Rights Risk Assessment at Plant level wherein a human rights risk 
coordinator was appointed by the Company to identify human rights risk at the plant and correspondingly conduct risk 
assessment  through interviews to people belonging to Executive and Management level in order to take preventive and 
mitigation measures at the plant level. Simultaneously a report was presented to the Management about ensuring of 
compliance with Human Rights.
5. Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues 
 
In line with the Company's Grievance Redressal Policy, a confidential and anonymous compliance hotline has been 
implemented for employees as well as suppliers / contractors to report breaches of both social and professional norms. 
This system operates in tandem with the Vigil Mechanism, designed to ensure appropriate resolution of grievances. 
 
Ensuring an unbiased approach, the Ethics Counsellor and/or the Chairperson of the Audit Committee oversee 
investigations of Protected Disclosures received under Vigil Mechanism / Whistle Blower Policy. This process 
underscores the significance of the complainant's rights, confidentiality, cooperation, and timely completion, all while 
upholding fairness and thwarting any undue interference.
 
Furthermore, employees have the option to formally register their complaint(s) in writing with POSH committee or 
directly address their concerns to the chairperson of the committee in respect of sexual harassment incidents.

8. Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases 
 
In order to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases, the Company has 
established mechanisms aimed at ensuring a fair and unbiased resolution process. One such mechanism is the inclusion 
of external members in the decision-making committee. These external members bring an objective unbiased perspective 
and help maintain the integrity of the proceedings. Any complaint received is investigated promptly and thoroughly.
 
In matters related to POSH where the complaint remains unresolved by the internal POSH committee, the option of 
litigation is available. This serves as an additional safeguard to protect the rights and well-being of the complainant. 
Litigation provides a formal avenue for seeking legal remedies and addressing any adverse consequences that may 
have resulted from the discrimination or harassment.
 
By incorporating external members, the Company demonstrates its commitment to address discrimination and 
harassment cases thoroughly and transparently. These measures are designed to ensure that the complainant is duly 
supported and protected against victimisation. 
 
To deal with issues other than Sexual Harassment incidents, Heidelberg Materials Group has established a compliance 
hotline known as “Speak Up” which can be used by any employee/ vendor of any of the subsidiaries of Heidelberg 
Materials group to anonymously report compliance incidents. In line with the group policy, HCIL has also extended this 
facility to its employees/ vendors for reporting compliance incidents. This platform ensures that all complaints are heard, 
recorded and registered with the compliance officer for appropriate action and simultaneously ensuring fariness and 
confidentiality are maintained. It helps in improving confidence of concerned stakeholders in the organisation and also 
has as a deterrent effect.

Energy management lies at the heart of HCIL's sustainability strategy. The Company strives to reduce its reliance on 
fossil fuels and transition to renewable energy sources. This Commitment is crucial in minimizing greenhouse gas 
emissions and promoting environmentally friendly practices. The Company aims to lower air pollutants below average 
emissions prescribed for the cement industry. Further, to mitigate climate impact on operations, the Company has 
implemented a wide range of initiatives and focuses on reduction in emission and adoption of renewable energy. The 
Company has significantly increased its renewable energy footprint by incorporating solar energy and biomass-based 
fuels in its operations to mitigate climate impact. Additionally, the plant is equipped with a waste heat recovery system, 
allowing the Company to recover and utilize a significant portion of energy demand. Dedicated plant teams continuously

monitor and work to reduce energy consumption and emissions by implementing strategic interventions such as 
incorporating conveyor belts in the supply chain and retrofitting existing equipment and machinery. The Company 
commissioned a 5.5 Mega Watt (MW) Solar Power Plant situated in its mining area at Damoh, Madhya Pradesh. This 
development has enabled the mining operations and clinker plant to receive a reliable supply of electricity. With an 
estimated annual generation of 10 Gigawatt hours, the solar plant serves as a sustainable alternative to the electricity 
previously procured through short term open access and from the grid. This initiative aligns with the Company's 
commitment to reducing its carbon footprint and promoting the use of renewable energy sources. Replacement of fossil 
fuels with alternative fuels (AFs) in clinker production has led to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions leading to 
significant expansion of renewable energy footprint. In line with these goals, AFs were introduced in Narsingarh Line 3, 
initially using biomass from nearby areas. The system handles up to 15t/h of AF, including biomass, RDF (Refuse Derived 
Fuel), and combustible components of Municipal Solid Waste. This initiative underscores the Company's commitment to 
sustainable practices and innovative energy sourcing.

10. Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted 
by your Company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the 
practices adopted to manage such wastes.
 
The Company is aligned with the concept of the circular economy and prioritizes waste management by embedding 
circularity throughout its production processes, including storage, usage, reuse, recycling, and disposal of waste 
generated at its facilities.
 
The Company strives to replace hazardous and toxic chemicals in or products with eco-friendly alternatives. The Company 
utilizes waste materials from other industries, such as blast furnace slag and fly ash, as input materials for cement 
manufacturing, effectively reducing the reliance on naturally extracted resources and promoting material circularity.
 
Various types of hazardous and non-hazardous waste are generated at the company's different plants, including used 
oil, biomedical waste, E-waste, and battery waste. The company has implemented appropriate infrastructure at each site 
to safely handle, collect, and store the different types of waste until they are sold to registered Central Pollution Control 
Board (CPCB) / State Pollution Control Board (SPCB) vendors and recyclers.
 
At the plant level, waste generated on-site is systematically managed through a color-coded collection bin system. 
However, instead of dealing with the waste disposal internally, the company has opted for selling waste to external 
vendors who take charge of the entire waste management process, from collection to final disposal. This helps the 
Company to safely dispose hazardous and non-hazardous waste.
