Business Conduct covers the definition of ‘Conflict of Interest’. Clause 3 (e) of the Code of Conduct for Board of Directors 
and Senior Management Personnel and Clause 13 of the Code of Ethics and Business Conduct explains the requirement 
of not involving in any subject matter which could cause a conflict of interest. The ‘WE HEAR’ tool is the mechanism 
followed by the Company where the matter can be raised and sent by email to the CS directly. Later, a team is formed 
to resolve the conflict. 
The relevant provisions are contained in clause 13 of Code of Conduct for Board Members and Senior Management with 
regards to disclosure of “Conflict of Interest”, which are reproduced as under: 
Conflicts of interest could arise: 
.	
Being employed (you or a close family member) by, or being in economic relation with an actual or potential customer, 
competitor, supplier or contractor. 
.	
Hiring or supervising family members or closely related persons. 
.	
Serving as a board member for another company or organization. 
.	
Owning or having a substantial interest in a customer, competitor, supplier or contractor. 
.	
Having a personal interest, financial interest or potential personal gain in any company transaction. 
.	
If co-workers become involved in personal relations with each other, the onus is on the senior employee concerned 
to bring this to the attention of his or her manager to confirm that there is no conflict of interest, nor will a conflict of 
interest arise.

At MapmyIndia, occupational health impacts arising from the nature of work environment are key material aspects. Primary 
among these are ergonomic health impacts, communicable diseases, food safety and commute/business travel safety. 
Identification and control of risks arising out of unsafe occupational environments and work practices are material aspects.

unsafe handling methods of waste, among others.
Our Approach is to look at health and safety from a holistic and integrated perspective, covering preventive and mitigation 
measures.

 Holistic programs are those that meet requirements across life stages and address aspects of both mental and physical 
well-being of an individual. 
• 	
An integrated approach seeks to incentivize behaviours through both organization-facilitated forums/programs and 
individuals compensation-benefit structures. 
• 	
Preventive measures include compliance with management systems and regulations, awareness building, 
communication and forum for consultation and feedback, including reviews and audits. 
• 	
Mitigation measures include post incident response handling and recovery measures. The Administration Team and 
HR department acts in case of fire alarms, medical situations, and partial and total evacuations of the Company location 
in question. The Members of these teams receive relevant training on an annual basis.

The goal of MapmyIndia is to actively assist major 
socio-economic growth in India and make it 
possible for a sizable number of individuals to take 
part in and profit from that development. This is 
based on the idea that development and expansion 
are only successful when they lead to greater 
access to opportunities and favourable outcomes 
for a larger segment of society. All of our CSR 
projects, are intended to benefit the impoverished 
and members of the society’s marginalised and 
vulnerable groups in one way or the other.
