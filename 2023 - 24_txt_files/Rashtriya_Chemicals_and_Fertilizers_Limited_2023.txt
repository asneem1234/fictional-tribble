5. 	Specific commitments, goals and targets set by the entity 
with defined timelines, if any. 24
RCF commits to conduct its business with highest 
ethical and governance standards. It has taken 
proactive quality improvement targets internally to 
ensure our customers are able to use best-in-class 
products. The business has also defined initiatives 
to enhance employee engagement and well-being. 
Our ESG Framework consists of three interlinked 
pillars, i.e., Protective Environment, Minimising 
Resource Use, and Inclusive Growth that reflect our 
commitment to minimizing the adverse impact of 
our operations on the planet and people. Each pillar 
encompasses specific themes and focus areas that 
guide our sustainability roadmap.  
The company is also in the process of setting ESG 
targets at organizational level within the defined 
boundaries.  Ammonia-V revamp project is being 
implemented as a part of energy improvement 
schemes to meet the new energy norms for Trombay 
Urea plant.  The scheme is envisaged to result in 
energy saving of 0.18 Gcal/MT of Ammonia. Project 
was completed in May 2024. 
The Company is upgrading the existing Effluent 
Treatment Plant at Thal for treating 10,000 M3/day 
effluent to ensure the quality of treated effluent not 
only meeting the statutory norms but also suitable 
for recycling the treated effluent as raw water. 
Benefit of the project will be better environment 
management on sustained basis through recycling 
of treated effluent as a raw water. The project is 
executed in two phases. In 1st phase, around 5000 
m3/day treated water will be recycled.  In 2nd phase, 
balance effluent will be recycled, to achieve “Zero 
Effluent Discharge” goal.  Project was completed in 
May 2024.

The Company is running Two Sewage Treatment 
Plants (STPs) at Trombay Unit with each plant having 
capacity to treat around 22.75 million Litres per 
Day (MLD) of sewage received from MCGM which 
otherwise would have been drained into the sea 
after preliminary treatment. The STP plants treat 
waste sewage generated in the city and convert it 
into treated water. Both plants together generate 
about 30 MLD of treated water which is being used 
in our plants as process water. Both STP plants of the 
Company are of great value to residents of Mumbai 
and Society at large besides improving reliability of 
operations of RCF Trombay Unit. During the year 
2023-24, about 8,152.82 million litres of treated 
water was generated at both STP plants.   
The Company is setting up Briquette Fired Boiler at 
RCF Thal. The low-cost steam shall help in reducing 
the variable cost of chemicals. Briquette (Biomass) or 
‘White Coal’ is made-up from agriculture and forest 
natural waste. It can be efficiently used to replace fossil 
fuel. Use of Briquettes for steam generation will reduce 
the Green House Gas (GHG) emissions. The project is 
expected to be completed by September 2024. 
As part of achieving ecologically sustainable growth, 
Company has forayed into solar power generation. 
The Company has set up a 2 MWp ground mounted 
Photovoltaic Solar power plant in Trombay Unit. In 
addition to this, the Company has commissioned 
solar rooftop facilities at Thal and Trombay with 
an aggregate capacity of 2.25 MWp. The power 
generated is used for captive consumption, thereby 
reducing Company’s power import to the equivalent 
extent. The green power generated by solar plants 
replaces the conventional power generated through 
burning of fossil fuels leading to reduction in overall 
Greenhouse gas emissions. During the year 2023-24, 
4439 MWh of solar power was generated.

by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the 
practices adopted to manage such wastes.80
	
3R strategy (Reduce, Reuse and Recycle) is employed in the different processes for effective implementation of 
waste management system at RCF. In the course of Fertilizer and Chemical manufacturing, the wastes generated 
from process and from other activities are taken care with proper planning for storage, recycle and disposal.
	
Extensive work is being done in RCF for management of waste by R&D activities and through improvement plans 
for reduction in waste generation, selection of suitable raw material for minimizing waste, R&D on waste for 
recycling and its sale as a valuable product for the end users.
	
At Trombay unit, the sludge generated from ETP contains certain amount of phosphates. It is recycled for 
manufacture of complex fertilizer Suphala (NPK15:15:15) as a source of P2O5. Sulphur sludge is generated in 
Sulphuric Acid plant is recycled to complex fertilizer plant Suphala (15:15:15) as a source of “S” in the form of 
secondary nutrient. Also, recycling of off grade/spoiled Suphala from Silo and converting it into saleable product.

Solar Power Generation 
facilities
As part of achieving ecologically sustainable 
growth, RCF has forayed into solar power 
generation. RCF has set up a 2 MWp ground 
mounted Photovoltaic Solar power plant in 
Trombay Unit in January 2016. In addition to this, 
RCF has commissioned solar rooftop facilities at 
Thal and Trombay with an aggregate capacity of 
2.17 MWp.
Use of renewable energy 
leading to lower greenhouse 
gas emissions
2
Sewage Treatment 
Plants (STPs)
RCF is operating Two Sewage Treatment Plants 
(STPs) at Trombay Unit each plant having capacity 
to treat around 22.75 Million Litres per Day (MLD) 
of sewage received from Municipal Corporation of 
Greater Mumbai (MCGM) which otherwise would 
have been drained in to the sea after preliminary 
treatment. The plant serves as a dual purpose, it 
not only solves the issue of treatment and disposal 
of sewage, but also relieves MCGM from the 
obligation of supply of 30 MLD of industrial water, 
and making equivalent amount of water available 
for the local community.
Treating 45.5 MLD of sewage 
to generate 30 MLD treated 
water, helps in conserving 
important natural resource 
i.e. Water there by reducing 
waste water.

Nano Urea Fertilizer 
Plant
RCF is setting-up a new Nano Urea Fertilizer Plant 
of capacity of 75 KL per day i.e. 1.5 Lakh Bottles 
per day of 500 ml capacity at RCF Trombay Unit.
Resources utilisation for 
production of the conventional 
urea and Fuel requirement

risks in existing plants & upcoming projects by conducting PSM audit, ISO audit, HSE index audit.
	
Disaster Prevention Measures:
	
The following activities are carried out for disaster prevention:
	
• 	
Periodical Safety Audit / OHSAS Audits.

Annexure – ESG Materiality Assessment FY 2023-24
Setting the ESG priorities:
ESG Material Assessment identifies key Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) factors that could impact business 
and stakeholders. RCF has considered a double materiality assessment, under which ESG factor is evaluated based on 
importance to the organization and its expected influence on business success, as well as the significance of the issue 
to stakeholders and their likely impact on business success based on the organization’s efforts (or lack thereof) on this 
issue.
RCF has performed its First ESG Materiality Assessment and has identified 14 material topics which are important to 
the business and stakeholders. 
The Materiality Assessment has been done by factoring global ESG standards and framework including GRI, SASB and 
MSCI and BRSR, benchmarking against peer materiality matrix across the chemical and fertilizer sector and inputs 
from extant government regulations. 
All the ESG materiality topics identified after inputs from above sources were shared to key stakeholders through an 
online survey for determining importance to stakeholders. The stakeholder group for the survey consisted of employees 
(management and non-management), customers, dealers & distributors, and domestic and international suppliers and 
contractors.
The material topics important to the business were identified by means of engagement through senior management 
of RCF, peer analysis and inputs from methodology used by ESG Rating Agencies.
The highest material topics so identified have been specified as risk or opportunity and RCF is envisaging actions to 
mitigate the risk and leverage on the opportunities identified.
