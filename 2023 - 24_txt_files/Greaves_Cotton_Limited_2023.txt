Leadership Indicators
1.	
Has the entity conducted Life Cycle Perspective / Assessments (LCA) for any of its products (for the manufacturing 
industry) or for its services (for the service industry)?
	
No. While we acknowledge the need for a comprehensive Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), we have actively implemented measures 
within our manufacturing operations to mitigate our environmental and social impact. Our commitment to sustainable practices is 
demonstrated through initiatives aimed at reducing energy consumption, water usage, and waste generation.
2.	
If there are any significant social or environmental concerns and/or risks arising from production or disposal of your 
products / services, as identified in the Life Cycle Perspective / Assessments (LCA) or through any other means,

3.	
Percentage of recycled or reused input material to total material (by value) used in production (for manufacturing 
industry) or providing services (for service industry).
	
Customer safety is of utmost importance to Greaves. Considering the critical products manufactured by Greaves, we do not recycle 
or reuse the input material in production. However, we do reuse/recycle packaging material to the extent possible. For more details, 
please refer answer to question number 4 of leadership indicator in Principle 2.
4.	
Of the products and packaging reclaimed at end of life of products, amount (in metric tons) reused, recycled, and 
safely disposed of.
	
Greaves does not reclaim products at the end of their lifecycle. However, we do reuse and recycle packaging materials wherever 
feasible. For instance,
	
1.	
We reuse steel pallets for engine transfers to OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers), thereby minimizing waste generation. 
This practice of utilizing reusable steel pallets instead of disposable ones not only conserves resources but also promotes 
sustainability.
	
2.	
We use reusable and recyclable Polypropylene packaging boxes multiple times which is used for supplying our products to 
OEM’s. This helps us to minimize corrugated box waste generation and promote sustainability.
	
3.	
We have employed a chip wringer to extract oil from scrap coolant, enabling us to reuse the coolant. This process efficiently 
recovers valuable oil while separating it from the coolant, reducing waste and maximizing resource utilization. By reusing the 
coolant, we not only minimize waste but also enhance environmental efficiency.
	
4.	
We have employed oil extractor and tramp oil cleaning machine to extract the oil from machining scrap coolant, enabling us to 
reuse this oil as machine coolant. This process efficiently recovers valuable oil while separating it from the scrap, reducing waste 
by removing tramp from coolant and maximizing resource utilization. By reusing the coolant, we not only minimize waste but 
also enhance environmental efficiency.

Is there a mechanism available to receive and redress grievances for the following categories of employees and

Yes/ No 
(If yes, then give details of the mechanism in brief)
Permanent Workers
 “Pancha Tatva” comprising of five values: Transparency, Integrity, Responsibility, Passion for Excellence and 
Respect, towards all our stakeholders is founding pillar to ensure that the business is carried within these 
boundaries ensuring positive workplace environment.
We have rolled out multiple platforms for addressing grievances, accessible to all employees and workers, 
providing them with opportunities to voice and report any complaints or concerns that they may have. 
‘SAMVAAD’ is one such platform where employees and workers collaborate and connect with each other 
for cooperation and better understanding.
We also conduct periodic welfare meeting, safety committee meeting, ‘Happy to Help’ activity for effective 
grievance redressal and ensuring a healthy workplace environment. Unit meetings are periodically held 
for both contractual and non-contractual workers and employees to discuss any concerns or grievances.
Additionally, ‘Whistle Blower Policy’ acts as a grievance mechanism for employees, workers and senior 
management where they can approach the Compliance Officer or the Chairman of the Audit Committee in 
situations of misconduct or breach of code of conduct and any other issues which hamper the functioning 
of the organization. This policy ensures responsible whistle blowing through efficient redressal and 
disciplinary action.
This approach encourages candid feedback and open discussion of issues, without employees fearing of 
repercussions or reprimands.
We strive to ensure transparency and effective redressal through open communication and access for all 
employees and workers to voice their concerns to the senior management.
Besides the above we also have a Prevention of Sexual Harassment (POSH) Policy to ensure a safe and secure 
working environment which can be accessed at https://greavescotton.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/

centralized treatment plant onsite. Post the treatment, the reclaimed water is utilized for gardening purposes, thereby reducing water 
consumption and promoting environmental sustainability.
	
In a proactive effort to further enhance water resilience, we have established a rainwater harvesting pond at the onset of the 
monsoon season. This reservoir serves as a vital water source year-round, supporting various operational activities, including 
production processes. By reducing reliance on freshwater sources and alleviating pressure on local water supplies, we demonstrate 
our commitment to sustainable water management. These comprehensive initiatives underscore our dedication to environmental

Independent Reasonable Assurance Statement on 
Business Responsibility & Sustainability Reporting
Introduction
We (‘Agile ESG Advisors Private Limited’ or ‘Agile Advisors’ or 
‘the Firm’) have been engaged by Greaves Cotton Limited or ‘the 
Company’ to provide an independent reasonable assurance on the 
non-financial sustainability disclosures presented in the Business 
Responsibility and Sustainability Report (‘BRSR’) 2023-24 (‘BRSR 
2023-24’) of Greaves Cotton Limited, for the period covering 
1st April 2023 to 31st March 2024 (‘the Year’ or ‘the Reporting Period’) 
as described in the scope, and limitations below. Our assurance 
process adhered to the requirements outlined in the ISAE 3000 
(Revised) standard.
Management’s Responsibilities
The management at the Company is responsible for preparing the 
designed BRSR 2023-24 that is free from any material misstatement 
in accordance with the reporting criteria (BRSR format) laid down 
by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (‘SEBI’) and for the 
information contained therein. The Company’s responsibilities 
include developing, implementing, and maintaining internal controls 
relevant to preparing and presenting the BRSR 2023-24 that is free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. It also 
includes conducting the materiality assessment process to identify 
material topics relevant to the Company based on the responses 
of the internal and external stakeholders. The Company ensures 
that it complies with the BRSR framework and local regulations. 
It designs, implements, and effectively operates controls to achieve 
the stated control objectives; selects and applies policies; makes 
judgments and estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances; 
and maintains adequate records in relation to its BRSR 2023-24. 
The Company is also responsible for preventing and detecting fraud 
and for identifying and ensuring that the Company complies with 
laws and regulations applicable to its activities. The Company is 
responsible for ensuring that the Company’s staff involved with the 
preparation of the BRSR 2023-24 are adequately trained, systems 
are appropriately updated, and that any changes in reporting 
encompass all significant operational sites.
Our Responsibilities
Our responsibility is to examine the BRSR 2023-24 prepared by the 
Company and to report thereon on the non-financial sustainability 
disclosures in the form of an independent reasonable assurance 
conclusion based on the evidence obtained. We conducted 
our engagement in accordance with the International Standard 
on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised), Assurance 
Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial 
Information issued by the International Auditing and Assurance 
Standards Board. The standard requires that we plan and perform 
our procedures to obtain a level of assurance about whether the 
non-financial sustainability disclosures in the BRSR 2023-24 comply 
with the BRSR framework in all material respects as the basis for our 
reasonable assurance conclusion.
The Firm applies the international standard on quality management, 
which requires the Firm to design, implement and operate a quality 
management system, including policies or procedures regarding 
compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and 
applicable legal and regulatory requirements. We have complied 
with the independence and other ethical requirements of the 
International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ International 
Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International 
Independence Standards) (‘IESBA Code’), which is founded on 
the fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional 
competence, and due care, confidentiality, and professional 
behaviour. The assurance procedures selected depend on our 
understanding of the BRSR 2023-24 and other engagement 
circumstances and our consideration of the areas where material 
misstatements are likely to arise. In obtaining an understanding 
of the BRSR 2023-24 and other engagement circumstances, we 
have considered the process used to prepare the BRSR 2023-24 in 
order to design assurance procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing a conclusion 
as to the effectiveness of the Company’s process or internal controls 
over the preparation and presentation of the BRSR 2023-24.
Our engagement regarding the non-financial sustainability 
disclosures also included assessing the appropriateness of the 
BRSR 2023-24, the suitability of the criteria used by the Company 
in preparing the BRSR 2023-24 in the circumstances of the 
engagement, evaluating the appropriateness of the methods, 
policies, and procedures, and models used in the preparation of 
the BRSR 2023-24, and the reasonableness of estimates made 
by the Company in the context of the non-financial sustainability 
disclosures. As part of this engagement, we have not performed any 
procedures by way of audit, review, or verification of the financial 
disclosures nor of the underlying records or other sources from 
which the financial statements and information were extracted.
Assurance Procedures
Our assurance process involves performing procedures to obtain 
evidence about the reliability of the disclosures in the BRSR 
2023-24. The nature, timing, and extent of the selected procedures 
depend on our judgment, including assessing the risks of material 
misstatement of the non-financial sustainability disclosures, 
whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, we 
have considered internal controls relevant to preparing the BRSR 
2023-24 to design assurance procedures that are appropriate in 
the circumstances.

Scope of Assurance
Our assurance engagement covered the BRSR disclosures made 
by Greaves Cotton Limited for the reporting period 2023-2024. 
The scope included assessing the organization’s adherence 
to the BRSR framework, which comprises key performance 
indicators (‘KPIs’).
Level of Assurance
Our work resulted in a reasonable assurance engagement of BRSR 
Core indicators and Limited assurance on other sustainability 
indicators in BRSR. We conducted our procedures in accordance 
with ISAE 3000 (Revised) and obtained evidence to support 
our conclusions.
Limitations
The assurance scope excludes the following:
•	
Data related to the Company’s financial performance.
•	
Data and information outside the defined Reporting 
Period FY 2023-24.
•	
The Company’s statements that describe the expression 
of opinion, claims, belief, aspirations, expectations, 
aims to future intentions provided by the Company and 
assertions related to Intellectual Property Rights and other 
competitive issues.
•	
Mapping of the BRSR 2023-24 with reporting frameworks 
other than those mentioned in the reporting criteria above.
•	
Performance of any management function, the Company 
is responsible for making management decisions, including 
accepting responsibility for the results of our services.
•	
Review of legal compliances.
Our scope and associated responsibility exclude, for the avoidance 
of doubt, any form of review of the commercial merits, technical 
feasibility, accuracy, or compliance with applicable legislation, and 
accordingly, we express no opinion thereon. We have also not 
verified any of the judgments and commercial risks associated with 
BRSR 2023-24 nor commented upon the possibility of any financial 
projections being achieved. We have relied on the data furnished 
by the Company and have not verified the efficacy and reliability of 
the Company’s information technology systems, technology tools/
platforms or data management systems.
Conclusion
Our conclusion has been formed based on and is subject to, the 
matters outlined in this report. We believe the evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
conclusion. Based on the procedures performed and evidence 
obtained, in our opinion, the non-financial sustainability disclosures 
are properly prepared in all material respects, based on the 
reporting criteria of BRSR. The BRSR 2023-24 has been evaluated 
against the BRSR framework. These criteria have been developed 
only for sustainability-related disclosures. As a result, the BRSR 
2023-24 may not be suitable for another purpose.
Independence
The assurance was conducted by a multidisciplinary team, 
including professionals with suitable skills and experience in 
auditing environmental, social, and governance information 
as per the requirements of ISAE 3000 (Revised). Our work was 
performed in compliance with the provisions of the IFAC Code 
of Ethics for Professional Accountants, which requires, among 
other requirements, that the members of the assurance team 
(practitioners) be independent of the assurance client in relation 
to the scope of this assurance engagement, including not being 
involved in writing the BRSR 2023-24. The Code also includes 
detailed requirements for practitioners regarding integrity, 
objectivity, professional competence, and due care, confidentiality, 
and professional behaviour.

on by any party wishing to acquire rights against us other than the 
Company for any purpose or context. Any party other than the
