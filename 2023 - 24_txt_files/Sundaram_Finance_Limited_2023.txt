6.
Performance of the entity against the specific 
commitments, goals and targets along-with reasons in 
case the same are not met.
Recognising its role towards all stakeholders at large, the Company has 
proactively taken the following steps:
a)	
Periodic engagement with different categories of customers, 
business partners and other value chain partners to ensure timely 
and fair financial access, as well as meaningful inclusion. The 
Company conducts regular training and awareness programs 
for employees to educate them on the importance of healthy 
customer relationship.  Further, the Company conducts periodic 
awareness programs for customers as part of RBI’s customer 
awareness initiatives. 80 − 90 % of financing is targeted towards 
the underserved Indian small entrepreneur.
	
Additionally, the Company engages periodically with depositors and 
shareholders in connection with unclaimed deposits, unclaimed 
dividends / shares, dematerialisation, nomination, electronic 
transfer option for receipt of dividends etc.
b)	
Contribution towards the sustenance of healthcare, education, 
environmental sustainability, ecological balance, heritage, art 
& culture, disaster relief, women empowerment, and rural 
development, so as to reach out to the vulnerable sections of the 
society across the country. Periodic health awareness programmes 
are conducted for employees and customers, with special focus on 
the marginalised and vulnerable segments like drivers, women, etc. 
During FY2024, the Company’s spending in respect of its CSR outlay 
included 37% towards healthcare, 40% towards education, 11% 
towards environment and ecology, and the balance 12% towards 
other focus areas. The Company carried out an impact assessment 
of the contributions made to six institutions, including three 
assessments on voluntary basis, through independent agencies.
c)	
Increased focus on funding in alternative fuel space, windmills, 
etc., high degree of investment in solar energy, prudence in the 
day-to-day consumption of energy, water etc., responsible waste 
management and increased thrust on preservation of ecological 
balance under CSR.  Nearly `2,500 cr. of disbursements in FY2024 
were towards financing clean fuel vehicles (EV, CNG, LNG, etc.).

Governance, leadership, and oversight
7.
Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets, and 
achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
Sundaram Finance has, over the past nearly seven decades, provided access to finance to small road transport operators, small 
construction equipment operators, small farmers and aspirational MSME entrepreneurs. The founding purpose of the Company 
has been to provide these underserved stakeholders finance at reasonable rates coupled with renowned “Sundaram experience,” 
an unswerving commitment to customer service.
The Company has a long history of adhering to the highest standards of governance, fairness and transparency, often leading 
the industry in adopting regulatory and policy dispensations well ahead of timelines set by respective authorities. The founder 
Chairman’s initiative to move an act of Parliament and amend the SBI Act to enable bank financing to NBFCs exemplifies these 
standards the Company has striven to hold. The Company also has an equally long track record in contributing to the communities 
that we live and operate in, with the focus being largely in the areas of healthcare, education, ecology and conservation of India’s 
rich culture & heritage. Consequently, the more contemporary ESG considerations have been an integral part of the complexion 
of the Company for decades now.
The Company has always taken a long-term view and believes that Sustainability objectives are an integral part of its core purpose. 
The Company has increased its focus on financing clean fuel vehicles and in its endeavour to reduce its carbon footprint, has 
ensured that nearly all branches, regional offices and its corporate head office have embraced solar power. Its social contributions 
extend pan-India and encompass support to over 100 beneficiaries. The Company believes that high standards of governance are 
a necessary imperative for serving all its stakeholders responsibly and to promote sustainability. The Company’s considered view 
is that ESG responsibilities and deliverables should be measured by how wide and deep ESG parameters are integrated into the 
Company’s processes, operational decisions & priorities, and not so much by “outcome” metrics.

Although, this Principle has limited or no applicability to the Company, the following steps are effectively implemented to ensure 
appropriate handling of e-waste:

2.	 The items are then bifurcated into reusable and disposable category. 
	
3.	 In respect of storage devices to be disposed of, hard disks are degaussed. 
	
4.	 Disposal of all e-waste in the Company is done only through a pre-approved e-waste management agency, with whom the Company

and takes suitable steps to dispose the devices at the agreed scrap value. 
	
6.	 E-waste disposal is done by the Company once in every three months, or at such shorter intervals as may be required.
	
The Company makes very limited use of plastic mineral water bottles and stationery items made of plastic.  The Company ensures 
that all such plastic waste is disposed of on a monthly basis or such other shorter frequency as may be considered necessary, in a 
responsible manner, through vendors who are authorised to recycle the same.  All other bio-degradable waste is disposed of in a
