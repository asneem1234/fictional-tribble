A brief on types of customers
	
	
	
Fedfina secured its NBFC license in 2010 and presently operates a network of 621 branches nationwide with 
presence in 17 states and union territories across India, with a strong footprint in the Southern and Western 
regions of the country.
	
	
	
We offer a diverse range of products, including Small Ticket Loan against Property (MSE LAP), mid ticket LAP, 
loans for Affordable Housing, Gold loans, Medium term working capital unsecured loans, etc..
	
	
	
Our affordable Home Loans are targeted at individuals with steady income streams (salaried or self-employed) 
but with inadequate ‘Formal Income Proofs’ who are hence deprived of financial assistance through traditional 
banking channels. We offer small ticket size loans against property (LAP) in urban, semi-urban and rural markets 
for meeting working capital needs, small business expansions, equipment purchases etc. as well as at times to 
meet personal needs like marriage, education etc. Our Mid-Size LAP Business or Mid-Ticket Home Loans are 
offered to self-employed customers (MSME) with mid-size/ larger businesses, established credit history, good 
asset base, formal income documentation etc. to meet working capital requirements, business expansions, 
asset finance, debt consolidation etc. We offer Gold loans to borrowers belonging to micro and small business 
segments, salaried, housewife, retired etc. We provide Unsecured Loans to self-employed businesses (MSME) 
and Professionals with established credit history and formal financials.

Financial 
inclusion
Opportunity
There is a significant 
gap in the reach of 
financial inclusion 
initiatives, with many 
underprivileged 
sections of society 
facing challenges in 
accessing essential 
financial tools. By 
reaching out to the 
underprivileged 
population, Fedfina’s 
goal is to bridge the 
financial gap and 
empower individuals 
economically. The 
ultimate aim is to 
contribute to the 
socio-economic 
development of these 
communities and 
enhance their overall 
well-being by offering 
them the means to 
save, invest, and 
secure their financial 
future.
Fedfina’s Vision Statement 
is aligned to ‘Empower 
Emerging India’. We have 
focus product programs 
(MSE LAP & Gold Loans) 
to meet working capital 
requirements of under-
served population 
segments with minimal 
/ no formal income 
documentation. Our 
Affordable Housing
programs meet working 
capital requirements 
of lesser privileged 
sections of the society 
and enable them to climb 
up the economic curve 
by supporting financial 
inclusion.
Positive:
-	
Accessing underserved 
populations broadens the 
customer base, potentially 
leading to increased 
revenue streams.
-	
Establishing long-term 
relationships through 
inclusive financial services 
can result in sustained 
customer loyalty, reducing 
new customer acquisition 
costs.
-	
We hire locals from 
the regions around our 
offices, thereby providing 
employment to the youth.
-	
Empowering 
underprivileged populations 
with inclusive services can 
result in an overall positive 
impact on economic activity 
in the country, contributing 
to sustainable development.

Responsible 
lending and 
Consumer 
Financial 
Protection
Risk/ 
Opportunity
It is critical that 
organisations make 
lending decisions that 
consider not only the 
financial health of the 
borrowers but also the 
broader economic and 
social implications.
It is a regulatory and 
a strategic necessity 
to prevent customers 
from falling victim to 
unfair or deceptive 
practices. It has 
become pertinent 
to align with the 
evolving consumer 
expectations for 
responsible and ethical 
business practices.
Fedfina’s commitment 
to responsible lending 
and consumer 
protection is evident 
in its comprehensive 
strategy that spans 
policy development, risk 
management, customer 
education, technology 
integration, compliance, 
and community 
engagement. We 
continuously evaluate and 
endeavour to improve our 
lending practices, ensuring 
alignment with NBFC 
regulatory frameworks. 
Robust risk management 
initiatives include 
enhancing the credit 
assessment process and 
implementing reasonable 
Loan-to-Value ratios. We 
as an entity try to support 
up & coming smaller 
groups or SHGs who 
require a start-up capital of 
up to 20 Lac.
We also do not promote 
or encourage any 
organization that conducts 
practices that will lead to 
harmful environmental 
impacts.
Customer education 
focuses on transparency, 
clear communication. 
Technology integration 
employs data analytics 
and digital platforms 
for efficient, compliant 
lending. Employee 
training emphasizes 
ethical practices, and CSR 
initiatives. Continuous 
improvement, driven by 
feedback and adaptability 
to market conditions, 
positions Fedfina to 
significantly contribute 
to the long-term 
financial well-being of its 
customers.
Negative:
-	
Monetary loss on account 
of fines and penalties
-	
Reputational damage
Positive:
-	
Enhanced customer trust 
and reduced customer 
turnover
-	
Lower default rates, 
translating into fewer 
non-performing assets and 
potential losses.
-	
Competitive advantage, 
being the go-to organisation 
for all financing needs of 
customers
-	
Increase in brand reputation

Human 
rights & 
grievance 
redressal
Opportunity
Human rights and 
grievance redressal 
should not only be a 
response to societal 
expectations but 
also be a strategic 
decision by companies 
to positively 
impact reputation, 
relationships with 
stakeholders, and 
overall business 
sustainability.
At Fedfina, we not only 
comply with ethical 
standards but also 
turn human rights 
considerations into an 
opportunity for positive 
impact, reputation 
enhancement, and 
sustainable business 
practices. Respecting & 
promoting human rights 
is one of the key ESG 
principles at Fedfina. 
We have dedicated 
policy commitments 
for accommodating all 
human rights aligning with 
national & international 
standards. All operational 
activities, vendor 
engagements & HR 
policies carry provisions 
against forced labour & 
child labour. They promote 
payments as per minimum 
wages, decent working 
conditions, grievance 
redressal mechanisms etc.
Positive:
-	
Reduced legal costs 
resulting from proactively 
managing human rights 
risks and addressing 
grievances promptly.
-	
A commitment to human 
rights can provide a 
competitive advantage 
in markets where ethical 
considerations influence 
consumer choices.
5.
Human 
Capital 
Development
Opportunity
In a sector like 
financial lending, a 
focus on employee 
development is not 
only an investment in 
the individuals but also 
in the overall resilience, 
competitiveness, 
and sustainability 
of the organization. 
It is important for 
organizations to 
ensure that human 
capital development 
strategies align 
with organizational 
success, enhance 
workforce capabilities, 
foster innovation, and 
contribute to a positive 
workplace culture.
At Fedfina, we believe 
in investing in the 
development of our people. 
Our initiatives are focussed 
to help create a skilled 
and efficient workforce, 
boosting productivity. 
We believe continuous 
learning drives innovation, 
giving us an edge in 
today’s knowledge-based 
economy. We are
committed to providing 
a safe, inclusive and 
respectful workplace to our 
employees and have put 
in place various measures 
to safeguard employee 
well-being and provide an 
engaging and interactive 
culture
Positive:
-	
A positive workplace culture 
can lead to higher employee 
morale and job satisfaction, 
which, in the long term, 
contributes to increased 
productivity and lower 
turnover.
-	
Improved employee 
relations leading to less 
disruptions, ensuring 
business continuity.
-	
Reduced long-term costs 
associated with hiring
-	
Continuous learning fosters 
innovation and adaptability, 
leading to long-term 
efficiency gains. This

processes and cost savings 
in the operational workflow.

Governance, leadership, and oversight
7. 	
Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG -related challenges, targets, and achievements
	
Fedfina has been a transformative force with over 13+ years of providing loans at reduced rates through its extensive network of 573+ branches. Despite 
our robust product offerings, we recognize and face several challenges in the implementation of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles, 
in our own operations as well as the value chain. In the environmental domain, challenges include addressing our carbon footprint, energy consumption, 
and the impacts of climate change. On the social aspect, ensuring financial inclusion, customer protection, and fostering diversity and inclusion pose 
challenges. On the governance front, maintaining high ethical standards, transparency, and compliance with regulatory requirements remain focal 
points.
	
In the fiscal year 2023, we initiated the incorporation of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles into our business operations, reinforcing 
our commitment to sustainability. We conducted a comprehensive baseline assessment of our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, waste management 
processes and other environmental indicators. Furthermore, we conducted an ESG materiality assessment, identifying key topics relevant to our 
company and sector. This assessment has informed our strategic priorities, and we are working towards developing an ESG roadmap for the future- 
setting internal reduction targets and defining timelines and initiatives to achieve those set targets.
	
As we are growing and becoming sizeable in the geographies and products we are in, we have ensured our commitment to the key Environmental, 
Societal and Governance related policies. We have formed a board approved ESG policy to ensure that the business growth is both sustainable and 
stable. Keeping in mind, the issue of climate change, we have formed an in-house climate change committee.
	
We believe that human talent is one of the key pillars for our success and growth. Our ability to attract and retain talent is demonstrated by our Company 
being certified as a “Great Place to Work” for the last four consecutive years, by the Great Place to Work Institute, India. Further, in calendar year 2023, we 
have also been recognized as one of the Top 50 Indian’s Best Workplaces in BFSI 2023’ by the Great Place to Work Institute, India. On the societal and 
community front, we continued our focus on responsible lending, and community engagement through CSR activities.
	
Going forward, Fedfina assures its unwavering commitment to ESG principles, emphasizing environmental sustainability, expanding financial inclusion 
efforts, employee empowerment, customer satisfaction, and community development. Strengthening governance mechanisms and promoting a culture 
of integrity and accountability are integral to our future endeavours and looking ahead, we will continue to be dedicated to having a positive imprint on 
the environment and society.

Essential Indicators
1. 	
Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity.
	
At Fedfina, Stakeholder Mapping involves conducting a thorough analysis to identify individuals, groups, or entities that have 
an impact on or are influenced by Fedfina. This includes internal stakeholders like employees and management, as well as 
external stakeholders such as customers, regulators, investors, suppliers, and local communities. The acknowledgment of 
government and regulatory bodies, industry associations, and engagement with advocacy groups is crucial. Recognizing 
the significance of customers, investors, suppliers, and local communities, as well as understanding public opinion, 
ensures a positive public image. Identifying and understanding competitors and considering internal committees further 
contribute to the development of effective engagement, communication, and collaboration strategies for a harmonious 
relationship with all relevant parties.
