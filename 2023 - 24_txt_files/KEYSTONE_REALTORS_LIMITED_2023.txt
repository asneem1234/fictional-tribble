Environmental 
norms/
legislations
Risk
New laws related 
to environment 
(specifically climate 
related), CSR activities 
are being created and 
enforced. Adherence to 
these new laws poses 
challenge.
Our 
EHS 
team 
understands 
the 
regulatory 
requirements 
to 
be 
complied with for the different legal 
requirements. They also seek help from 
the Compliance team to understand 
any specific compliance requirements 
that may be applicable. These areas 
are covered under the internal audit 
program from a compliance point of 
view as well. As part of sustainability 
reporting, independent assessments 
conducted (by external consultants/
experts) also help in addressing gaps if 
any in this area.
Negative 
Implications
2.
Regulatory 
Compliance
Risk
Failure to comply 
with regulatory 
requirements can 
manifest in financial 
and reputational 
consequences for an 
organisation and erode 
stakeholder trust.
The Company has a robust set of 
environmental, social and governance-
related policies to foster a culture of 
compliance within the organisation. 
Disciplinary 
measures 
and 
reinforcement mechanisms have been 
defined as well. The ESG organogram 
further highlights the importance of 
overall 
compliance 
by 
positioning 
the CS in a key role, ensuring overall 
corporate governance in all three 
verticals (ESG). In addition, Legal 
and functional teams also monitor 
the regulatory compliances across 
businesses at defined frequencies.
Negative

Community 
Development
Opportunity
Community 
development activities 
helps a company 
to create a positive 
impact on society 
by undertaking 
meaningful 
interventions to bring 
significant benefits to 
large sections of the 
society. The CSR efforts 
also help foster a more 
productive and positive 
work environment for 
employees. 
The 
Rustomjee 
Foundation 
has 
been striving to create sustainable 
opportunities for the marginalized 
communities by facilitating quality 
education, 
sustainable 
livelihood 
development, promoting a healthy 
society 
and 
supporting 
rural 
infrastructure 
development. 
The 
outreach as of now has been to 741 
Students, 
villages 
in 
Maharashtra. 
With an aim to contribute to the 
holistic development of communities, 
Rustomjee Foundation is contributing 
to the global agenda of meeting 
Sustainable

Modernization, 
Innovation 
and Resource 
Optimization 
Opportunity
The world is changing 
constantly and to 
remain relevant and 
profitable, it is an 
essential need to 
adapt and develop 
new advancements for 
meeting new realities. 
The same applies to 
construction industry 
during and post 
construction
Innovation advancements are at centre 
stage, 
which 
supports 
enhancing 
operational efficiency, and reducing 
overall environmental impacts. The 
company has invested in technologies 
and made changes to its processes 
to reduce resource consumption not 
only during the construction phase 
but also as a sustainable impact to its 
customers.  Energy efficiency through 
passive and active measures, reduced 
water consumption, effective waste 
management, use of sustainable and 
green products in the buildings are 
some of the initiatives taken and being 
enhanced for future projects. As a 
result two of our larger projects have 
achieved a silver rating from IGBC's 
new building rating systems and most 
of our upcoming and ongoing  projects 
are slated to be certified under IGBC's 
new building rating systems.   We are 
also in the process of initiating one of 
our key projects as a net zero energy, 
waste and water project.
Positive 
Implications
5.
Scarcity Of Water
Risk
Water is a shared 
resource, making 
it important for 
businesses to 
use it responsibly. 
Ensuring responsible 
consumption is key 
to the business’ social 
license to operate and 
a sustainable planet 
for all. Water being an 
important resource in 
construction industry 
its scarcity may lead 
to disruptions in 
operations and delay 
timelines of project 
completion
Mumbai and its suburban areas/
adjoining districts receive good rainfall 
every year and ground water table 
is recharged. The turbidity of water 
and the sulphate and iron content in 
water used for construction may pose 
a threat to quality of construction 
(corrosion etc). The cost of treatment 
of GW, procuring water and non-
supply of municipal water will become 
a high-risk event in the future. KRL 
and 
its 
subsidiaries 
continues 
to 
adopt water conservation strategies 
across all of the existing project sites 
and also supplement internal water 
generation by procuring water from 
outside agencies. Rainwater harvesting 
system has been implemented at few 
facilities which helps in increasing 
the ground level water. This results in 
release of sub soil water from recharge 
pits, and this reduces the dependency 
on external agencies. The Company 
has instituted an EHS Policy that 
highlights the importance of Resource 
Conservation, this serves as a guiding 
principle to reduce consumption of 
water and other resources. The EHS 
team runs awareness campaigns to 
ensure that all personnel are aware of 
the risk related to water shortage.

Human Rights 
such as child 
labor, forced/
compulsory 
labor, health 
and safety, 
discrimination 
and freedom 
of association 
and collective 
bargaining 
including anti- 
harassment
Risk
Upholding human 
rights is essential 
to protecting 
organization’s 
communities, 
employees and other 
stakeholders.
The 
Company 
has 
constituted 
a 
standing forum, both at the Group Level 
as well as at individual entity level, that 
aids and advises the management in its 
approach towards building sustainable 
Human Rights. Group HR is responsible 
to ensure that any issue or impact 
related to human rights are addressed 
in the defined manner within the 
stipulated 
timeline. 
The 
Company 
has a robust contractor management 
system which ensures human rights 
practices are adhered to (as per ILO) 
by the contractors supplying man-
power to the Company. We have very 
stringent norms for child labor, anti-
discrimination, forced labor or bonded 
labor, anti- harassment, workers health 
and safety and other human rights 
issues at all project sites.

Economic 
Performance
Opportunity
Ensuring business 
profitability and strong

in the growth of the 
business, employees,

stakeholders.
The Company thrives to deliver strong 
economic 
performance 
through 
our operational practices and risk 
mitigation strategies that supports the 
nation building and create a value for 
all the stakeholders.

Climate change 
resulting in 
acute and 
chronic physical 
conditions
Risk
Severe weather 
events are a risk to our 
operations and asset 
management along 
with internal as well as 
external stakeholders. 
Climate risk is material 
to customers, investors, 
and employees too. 
Responding to these 
concerns has become 
central to stakeholder 
understanding of 
climate-related risk 
to the company.  
Climate change can 
impact our operations 
due to extreme 
weather conditions 
like cyclones, floods, 
droughts and heat 
waves, to name a few 
events that have the 
potential to create 
severe disruptions.
The Company is in the process of 
implementing various initiatives across 
projects sites/facilities to control our 
scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions mainly 
due to energy consumption & Waste 
generation.  The company is in the 
process of also calculating our scope 
3 emissions in 3 major categories 
applicable to our business in FY24-
25.  We also plan to work closely with 
our critical suppliers to understand 
their strategies to comply with and 
move beyond on their material ESG 
issues. 
Hazard 
Identification 
and 
Risk 
assessment with 
regards 
to 
severe weather conditions have been

Occupational 
health and safety
Risk
Failure to ensure the 
health, safety and 
well-being of the 
company employees 
and  contractor 
workforce can impact 
productivity. This can 
consequently affect our 
business operations, 
customer satisfaction 
and profitability.
The Company strives to foster a safe 
working 
environment 
and 
ensure 
Zero Harm. Hazards and risks are 
periodically identified, with mitigation 
plans devised for each. Additionally, 
safety 
trainings 
are 
provided 
to 
employees and workers (labour force) 
on regular basis to ensure their holistic 
well-being. Safety and Health of labour 
workers is critical and our Contractor 
management 
system 
ensures 
the 
requirements are adhered to.   
Negative 
Implications

Cybersecurity 
and data privacy.
Risk
Protecting customer 
(personal) and 
company information 
is of utmost concern to 
us.  This ensure trust 
in the company and 
misappropriation of 
data. 
We have an information security and 
incident management policy in place. 
Awareness on the policy was cascaded 
to all employees within the company 
for compliance in FY23-24 and will 
be continued in the coming Financial 
years. Presently we have access control 
review mechanisms that are also 
enabled by segregation of duties.  This 
ensures protection of all information 
systems.  Moving forward we are 
working on masking personal sensitive 
information as would be outlined in the 
data protection bill in the future.

Plastics  
(including packaging)
We prioritize responsible waste management by sorting non-biodegradable plastics within 
our facilities and directing them to designated vendors for recycling or reuse.
E-waste
To ensure responsible e-waste management, all electronic devices reaching the end of 
their life cycle within our company premises are recycled by certified vendors approved by 
the State Pollution Control Board within 180 days, complying with e-waste management 
regulations.
Hazardous waste
All hazardous waste is generated by contractors at our projects. In order to ensure responsible 
and compliant hazardous waste management, we have a contract agreement with our 
contractors to utilize State Pollution Control Board (SPCB)-authorized vendors for the disposal 
of all hazardous waste.
Other waste
Our labor camps prioritize responsible waste management practices through a partnership 
with the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). BMC diverts biodegradable food waste 
for composting or processing into manure, minimizing landfill dependence and promoting 
resource recovery. Construction debris is managed according to BMC regulations. This may 
involve selective demolition practices to minimize waste generation and ensure proper 
disposal at designated landfills.

The company has provided labor camps for contract workers at some project sites. In line with our commitment to human 
rights and equality, we ensure that contract laborers have access to basic amenities such as potable drinking water, 
sanitized and hygienic washrooms, clean rest areas, and good housekeeping measures, including regular pest control 
to avoid pests and rodents. This not only enhances the well-being of workers by keeping them free from contagious 
diseases spread by infestations of pests and mosquitoes but also increases productivity by reducing absenteeism. Our 
new labor camp in Thane is designed with better amenities, including a full-fledged STP aimed at reusing treated water, 
as well as recreation areas for workers. We also plan to build a crèche for workers with families and children.
We are working on our Supplier Code of Conduct and plan to roll it out in FY2024-25 to foster an environmentally 
sustainable culture among our critical suppliers, who need our support and assistance to ensure that their activities do 
not further impact the planet.
