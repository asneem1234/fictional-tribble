7. 	 Statement by director responsible 
for the business responsibility report, 
highlighting ESG related challenges, 
targets and achievements (listed entity 
has flexibility regarding the placement 
of this disclosure
At 
Greenlam, 
environment-social-governance 
(ESG) 
is 
particularly critical as the end product needs to be built with 
natural resource and any deviation from the mean or perceived 
irresponsibility can affect respect and market position. The 
environment component at our company ensures that our 
business consumes environmentally responsible resources, 
consumes only as much as is moderately needed, recycles 
water, responsible waste management, consumes moderate 
fossil fuels and builds resistance to climate change. The social 
component addresses the need to invest in employees, 
vendors, customers and community engagement, a framework 
of relationships that protects the company from unexpected 
supply or demand or production shocks. At Greenlam, ESG 
provides a platform for doing the right things the right way at 
the right time, the basis of its long-term sustainability.
