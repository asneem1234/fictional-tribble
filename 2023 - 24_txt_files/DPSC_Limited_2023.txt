Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report 2023-2024
INTRODUCTION
India Power Corporation Limited (“IPCL”) is one of India’s leading smart-holistic-sustainable power utilities, operating in India’s 
only parallel licensee distribution area- Asansol-Raniganj. Established in 1919 during the era of British rule, the company has 
ingrained sustainability as a core value since obtaining its power distribution license in 1935. Across its 105-year journey, 
IPCL has weathered significant shifts in political, social, and business landscapes, notably India's independence, transitioning 
from British management to public sector administration, and finally to private leadership.
Surviving and thriving for over a century is a testament to IPCL's commitment to business, environmental and social 
sustainability. Adapting to industry dynamics, the company has expanded its distribution network, embraced disruptive 
technologies, ventured into green energy and prioritized community development.
Originally focused on coal mines and industries; IPCL’s distribution model evolved to serve railways, commercial markets, and 
eventually the low tension (LT) domestic segment. With a remarkable transmission and distribution loss of only 3%, achieved 
through continuous technical upgrades, IPCL has emerged as a digital organization, leveraging smart meters, SCADA systems, 
GIS-equipped substations and more.
Stepping into the future, IPCL embraces green initiatives, with 50% of its power procurement already sourced from renewable 
energy. IPCL’s association with Switzerland-based E2S Power to bring efficient Thermal Energy Storage Systems (TESS) is a 
testament to its contribution towards India’s mission to achieve net zero emission by 2070. The synchronization of the TESS 
unit with IPCL’s power plant at Asansol will help the company achieve its goal of integrating 80% renewable energy into the 
distribution system by the end of 2024.
Social responsibility is deeply ingrained in IPCL’s corporate philosophy, encapsulated by the 3Ds: Discipline, Dedication, and 
Devotion. Beyond mere business interests, the company actively engages in community development, offering scholarships, 
recognizing women achievers, promoting cultural heritage, and championing health and environmental initiatives.
IPCL’s commitment to social and environmental sustainability is documented in its Business Responsibility & Sustainability 
Report (BRSR), aligned with national guidelines and regulatory requirements. By adhering to responsible business conduct 
principles, the company ensures transparency and accountability in its operations, driving holistic growth while serving as a 
beacon of sustainable development in the power sector.

1
GHG 
Emissions
Risk
Customers may demand commitments to 
reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 
or impose conditions related to emissions 
for conducting business. Certain investors 
focused on environmental, social and 
governance (ESG) criteria may only invest 
in companies that meet GHG reduction 
targets. In the power generation sector, 
companies may be required to implement 
emission reduction programs due to 
India’s current and potential future climate 
commitments. The government may 
also establish stringent targets and is in 
the process of creating a carbon trading 
market. Failure to mitigate GHG emissions 
could lead to the loss of potential 
customers, disinterest from specific 
groups of investors, and increased costs 
to comply with regulatory requirements.
GHG emissions is 
being mitigated by
(1)Conducting 
energy audits and 
identifying areas 
of energy loss 
reduction
(2)Increased sourcing 
of renewable 
energy
Negative financial 
implications could 
result in the form of 
capital expenditure or 
increase of renewable 
energy procurement 
and/or purchase of 
voluntary or mandatory 
emission offsets 
(under the proposed 
CCTS).

Waste 
Management
Risk
Improper hazardous waste management 
by waste management contractors 
presents risks to land, water bodies, 
flora and fauna. Non-compliance with 
regulation and inefficient modus operandi 
can firstly have direct financial and 
reputational implications, and secondly 
impact the environment.
Ensuring that 
hazardous waste is 
handled and disposed 
off by only authorized 
contractors of the 
State Pollution 
Control Board.
The resource 
conservation policy 
provides guidance 
to incorporate 
the principles 
of circularity in 
processes and 
production. Complies 
with all applicable 
environmental laws 
and regulations and 
takes initiatives to 
manage and reduce 
quantities of waste 
generated.
Negative financial 
implications could 
result in the form of 
capital expenditure for 
recycling of unwanted 
scraps.
3
Energy 
management
Risk
IPCL’s energy generation processes 
require a significant amount of energy, 
and saving energy not only contributes to 
our financial performance but also helps 
us reach our emissions reduction targets.
Conducting energy 
audits and identifying 
areas of energy 
reduction and 
implementing suitable 
measures for the 
same
Negative financial 
implications could 
result in the form of 
capital expenditure 
for implementation 
of energy reduction 
initiatives.
Positive implications 
to the company’s 
business could 
result from initiatives 
taken around energy 
management 
attracting customers 
aligned to sustainable 
businesses.

Product 
Responsibility
Opportunity
IPCL encourages customers to adopt 
energy conservation techniques, which 
help reduce overall emissions and 
promote sustainability. By providing 
resources and support for efficient 
energy use, we not only demonstrate 
our commitment to the environment 
but also build trust with our customers. 
This mutual effort leads to cost savings, 
enhances energy security and fosters 
a stronger and more responsible 
community.
IPCL being a 
member of the World 
Business Council 
for Sustainable 
Development 
(WBCSD), we 
are aligning our 
business model 
with the Products 
and Materials 
transformation 
pathway to Vision 
2050, to ensure 
resource use is 
optimized to meet 
society’s needs while

Occupational 
Health and 
Safety
Risk
It directly affects individuals and the 
local community and has the potential to 
cause disruptions in operations. Failure 
to ensure health and safety could result 
in increased cost of litigation, reduced 
availability of manpower, reduced 
employee morale, or even threaten the 
viability of operations in worst case 
scenarios.
IPCL has taken 
various measures to 
mitigate occupational 
health and safety 
risks including:
1.Implementing safety 
and occupational 
health standards.
2.Automation and 
mechanization 
plan to eliminate 
high risk manual 
activities
3.Identifying, 
understanding, 
controlling and 
eliminating the 
risks associated 
with hazards at the 
workplace.
Negative financial 
implications could 
arise from impacts on 
business reputation. 
Employee morale and 
performance could 
also be impacted and 
attributed to negative 
business performance.
6
Diversity, 
Equity, 
Inclusion
Opportunity
This is a key facet of an equal opportunity 
employer, which would lead to a more 
inclusive and equitable workplace, 
strengthen employee engagement, 
improve customer satisfaction, and build 
a positive brand reputation.
We provide the 
right work culture 
through policies and 
processes which 
encourage diversity in 
the workforce.
Positive financial 
implications.
7
Transparency 
& Disclosure
Risk/ 
Opportunity
Risks related to transparency 
and disclosure present in timely 
communication of regulatory and 
stakeholder-oriented disclosures. Failure 
to disclose IPCL’s financial and ESG related 
information in a transparent manner could 
lead to reputational risks and negative 
perceptions from stakeholders.
Opportunities are present in factually 
correct, transparent and timely disclosures. 
Increase in publishing climate related 
disclosures presents an opportunity for 
IPCL to build trust and reputation with all 
stakeholders.
To mitigate risks 
related to transparency 
and disclosure, regular 
and open dialogue 
with all stakeholders 
are conducted. 
Disclosures for 
increased transparency 
are also improved.
Both positive and 
negative financial 
implications arising 
from the brand 
reputation of the 
company.
