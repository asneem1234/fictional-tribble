Economic 
Performance
Risk
Economic performance is a 
risk for BPCL as it directly 
impacts the company’s 
financial strength, including 
revenue growth, cost 
optimization, profitability, and 
shareholder value, which is 
also impacted due to higher 
crude oil prices, geopolitical 
conflicts, and market risks.
To achieve sustainable financial returns and 
mitigate climate change risks, the company  
has committed to achieving Scope 1 and 
Scope 2 Net Zero emissions by 2040.
Negative implications as it 
will affect the profitability of 
the company.
2
Being a 
Responsible 
Corporate
Risk
Being a responsible 
corporate organization 
subjects the business to 
regulatory risk owing to 
non-compliance concerns. 
Ethical business practices, 
transparency, adherence 
to legislation, and CSR 
programs have a substantial 
impact on external 
impressions that might 
have implications for the 
organization.
Regularly engage with diverse stakeholders 
to understand their concerns and maintain 
positive relationships. Implement CSR projects 
aligned with business goals to contribute 
positively to communities and enhance 
reputation. Embed sustainability into decision-
making to mitigate environmental and social 
risks while driving long-term value. Enhance 
transparency in governance practices to build 
trust and credibility. Working with industry, 
government, and non-profits to address shared 
challenges and promote best practices.
Negative Implication as 
non-compliance with 
regulatory requirements 
would lead to penalties and 
litigation. 
Non-compliance can 
lead to legal penalties, 
reputational damage, and a 
loss of investor confidence.
3
Compliance to 
Governance
Risk
Compliance with governance 
regulations is crucial for 
maintaining legal standing, 
ensuring transparency, 
upholding ethical business 
practices, and building 
trust among stakeholders. 
Regulatory changes, 
evolving standards, 
and global governance 
frameworks pose risks if not 
adhered to, affecting BPCL's 
reputation and financial 
performance.
Conduct regular compliance risk assessments. 
Develop and implement remediation plans 
promptly. Establish clear escalation procedures 
and whistleblower mechanisms. Strengthening 
of internal audit functions. Collaborate with 
legal advisors and industry peers.
Negative Implication 
as identifying risks and 
opportunities related 
to governance helps 
BPCL mitigate legal and 
regulatory compliance 
risks, foster stakeholder 
trust, and demonstrate 
commitment to ethical 
governance.
4
Product 
Security
Risk
Ensuring product security is 
vital to maintaining customer 
trust in product quality, 
safety, hazardous nature, 
and brand reputation. 
With increasing concerns 
about product safety and 
counterfeit activities, failure 
to address these risks could 
result in a loss of market 
competitiveness and legal 
liabilities.
BPCL ensures the safe transportation of 
petroleum products through safety standards 
and capacity-building programs, high standards 
of vehicular safety, inclusive development of 
transport crews, regular training for PCVO 
crew, DSM, and delivery staff, and identifying 
opportunities to replace existing modes of 
transportation with safer alternatives like 
pipelines.
Negative implications 
include risks such as 
tampering, theft, or 
contamination, which can 
lead to financial losses and 
damage to reputation.
5
Efficient Water 
Management
Risk
Water is a critical resource 
in various aspects of BPCL's 
operations, including refining 
processes and cooling 
systems. Effective water 
management is essential 
for ensuring sustainable 
operations, particularly in 
regions experiencing water 
scarcity.
Efficient water management significantly 
enhances BPCL's corporate value by reducing 
environmental impact, lowering operating 
costs, increasing productivity, and mitigating 
risks related to water shortages and regulatory 
compliance. This streamlines manufacturing 
processes and improves operational efficiency.
Negative implications 
include risks such as 
water shortages, pollution 
incidents, and regulatory 
non-compliance, which 
can impact operational 
continuity and stakeholder 
perception.

6
Energy Use 
and Transition
Opportunity BPCL's efforts to transition 
to sustainable energy 
sources and optimize energy 
use are critical for reducing 
emissions and ensuring 
long-term resilience. 
Opportunities include 
future regulatory changes, 
market and technological 
disruptions, and new 
sources of energy. Failure 
to adapt to changing energy 
landscapes could result in 
increased costs, penalties, 
and stranded assets.
BPCL's strategic focus on energy resource 
management and transitioning to sustainable 
energy sources is crucial for its long-term value 
creation. This approach ensures environmental 
sustainability, drives cost efficiency, enhances 
competitiveness, and positions the company 
for future growth, demonstrating BPCL's 
commitment to financial viability, environmental 
responsibility, and technological advancement.
Positive implications 
include aligning with 
global energy transition 
trends, enhancing 
BPCL's competitiveness, 
mitigating climate-
related risks, adopting 
low-carbon technology, 
and contributing to a 
sustainable energy future.
7
Occupational 
Health & 
Safety
Risk
Prioritizing occupational 
health and safety is essential 
to protect employees and 
maintain productivity. Risks 
include workplace accidents, 
injuries, and regulatory 
non-compliance, which 
can compromise human 
well-being, lead to financial 
losses, damage reputation, 
and cause employee 
disengagement.
Conduct comprehensive risk assessments, 
develop robust safety management systems, 
provide safety training, foster a proactive 
safety culture, and monitor safety performance 
metrics. Identifying occupational health and 
safety risks enables BPCL to implement robust 
safety protocols, provide adequate training and 
personal protective equipment, conduct regular 
safety audits, and promote a culture of safety 
awareness.
Negative implications 
include the failure to 
ensure a safe work 
environment, which could 
result in legal liabilities and 
penalties.
8
Managing & 
Minimizing 
Environmental 
Impact
Risk
Minimizing environmental 
impact is crucial for 
mitigating climate change 
and preserving natural 
resources. Risks include 
air and water pollution, 
habitat destruction, and 
regulatory fines. By 
integrating environmental 
considerations into its 
operations, BPCL can 
enhance environmental 
stewardship, mitigate 
reputational risks, and 
contribute to sustainable 
development goals.
BPCL conducts operations with minimal 
environmental and ecological impacts, focusing 
on natural resources such as soil, water, 
air, and biodiversity. Suitable management 
and mitigation measures are implemented 
throughout the project lifecycle.
Negative implications 
include the failure to 
manage environmental 
risks, which could result in 
legal sanctions, community 
backlash, and operational 
disruptions.
9
Asset Integrity 
& Process 
Safety
Risk
Maintaining asset integrity 
and process safety is 
essential to prevent 
accidents and protect human

Does the entity have processes in place to avoid/manage conflict of interests involving members of the 
Board? (Yes/No) If yes, provide details of the same.
	
Yes, the Company has established a ‘Code of Conduct for Board Members and Senior Management Personnel’ 
to prevent conflicts of interest wherein the directors must sign a declaration stating that they will not participate in 
situations which are directly or indirectly in conflict with the Company’s interests. The Code prohibits directors from

a.	
Does the entity have procedures in place for 
sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)
	
	
The company abides by the Public Procurement 
Policy for Micro and Small Enterprises (MSE) 
Order 2012 and its subsequent amendments. The 
company’s total procurement value of Goods and 
Services during 2023-24, excluding Works Contracts, 
where MSEs could have participated was I 9,821.28 
crore whereas the actual procurement value from 
MSEs was I 3,315.40 crore, i.e., an achievement of 
33.76% thereby exceeding the target of 25%. The 
company also offers Trades Receivable Discounting 
Scheme (TReDS) to its MSME Vendors.
 
 
As an effort to enhance procurement from MSEs, 
the Company held online Vendor Development 
Programs for MSE SC/ST and MSE Women, 
in which over 250 vendors participated and 
received extensive presentations from MSME and 
NSSHO (National SC/ST Hub office) authorities. 
The firm also took part in ten MSME Vendor 
Development Programs hosted by several MSME 
DFOs (Development and Facilitation Offices). The 
company also conducted two workshops for BPCL 
vendors to enroll them in TReDS platforms. In all 
of these events, vendors were welcomed, and their 
expertise was expanded by various presentations 
on the company’s existing and future business 
requirements, as well as emerging trends.
	
b.	
If yes, what percentage of inputs were 
sourced sustainably?
 
 
33.76% inputs were sourced sustainably.
3.	
Describe the processes in place to safely 
reclaim your products for reusing, recycling, 
and disposing at the end of life, for (a) Plastics 
(including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous 
waste and (d) other waste.
 
BPCL R&D is exploring the use of mixed plastic waste 
in environmentally friendly and sustainable ways, such 
as road making at refineries and retail outlets. The 
proposal is to evaluate this through certified bodies for 
commercial applications, aiming to achieve “Net Zero” 
goals and meet the “Swachh Bharat Mission” targets.
	
The Plastic Waste Management Rules mandate 
Extended Producers Responsibility (EPR) for managing 
plastic waste packaging. In 2023-24, BPCL Lube 
collected 4891 MT of plastic waste and reprocessed it 
through an approved party.
	
E-Waste 
is 
being 
disposed 
as 
per 
E-waste 
Management Rules 2022 requirements. BPCL has also 
made a waste management manual for the benefit of 
locations. E-waste disposal is centrally monitored by 
IS Department.
	
Hazardous waste includes spent catalysts, oily sludge, 
and oily sludge from refineries. Spent catalysts contain 
precious metals and are sent to recyclers for recovery, 
co-processing, or incineration. Oily sludge from storage 
tanks and Effluent Treatment Plants is treated and 
blended with finished products. Unused sludge is either 
bio-remediated or incinerated.
	
Kitchen waste, generated in refinery towns and 
canteens, is treated in waste management plants 
to convert it into biogas and manure. Biomedical 
waste is managed according to the Biomedical Waste 
Management Rules, 2016, and batteries are disposed off 
through registered recyclers through a buy back policy.
	
Non-hazardous wastes are managed through the 
reduction, reuse, and recycling process.
	
Waste Management System at BPCL:
	
BPCL’s waste management system operates on a 
clear categorization of waste into hazardous and non-
hazardous types, each with specific disposal methods 
and recycling strategies. Within the hazardous category, 
materials like spent catalysts and slop oil undergo a 
recycling process, either through authorized recyclers 
or internal reprocessing for reuse. On the other hand, 
non-hazardous waste, including light waste, plastic 
waste, and canteen waste, follows a different route. 
These materials are either internally recycled or sold to 
authorized vendors, serving various purposes like the 
production of bio-manure. Moreover, BPCL ensures the

responsible disposal of hazardous waste like spent clay containing oil or residues containing oil, employing safe landfilling 
methods facilitated by Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facilities (TSDF). For critical waste streams like bio-medical 
waste, BPCL relies on incineration, a process predominantly managed by government hospitals.

Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes/No). If yes, 
whether the waste collection plan is in line with the EPR plan submitted to Pollution Control Boards? If not, 
provide steps taken to address the same.
 
The Plastic Waste Management Rules mandate Extended Producers Responsibility (EPR) for managing plastic waste 
packaging. BPCL, a lubricant manufacturer and packaging company, has been granted EPR for plastic waste recycling 
in the Indian market. The policy was notified on February 16, 2022, and the waste collection plan aligns with the EPR 
plan submitted with the Pollution Control Board. In 2023-24, BPCL Lubes collected 4891 MT of plastic waste and 
reprocessed it through a CPCB-approved party, which is used in manufacturing various everyday plastic items.

Leadership Indicators
1.	
Provide the processes for consultation between 
stakeholders and the board on economic, 
environmental, and social topics or if consultation 
is delegated, how is feedback from such 
consultations provided to the board.
	
Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) is 
dedicated to sustainability and ethical business 
practices. It has instituted procedures to facilitate 
dialogue between stakeholders and the board regarding 
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) matters. 
The company actively engages in surveys, focus 
groups, and stakeholder meetings to gather input on its 
sustainability endeavors.
	
BPCL has established a Board-level Sustainable 
Development Committee (SDC), composed of two full-
time Directors and four Independent Directors, with 
an independent director leading the committee. The 
Sustainable Development Committee is responsible for 
overseeing strategy and monitoring the implementation 
of key sustainability initiatives. Twice a year, the 
Sustainable 
Development 
Committee 
assesses 
sustainability efforts, reviews material topics, evaluates 
stakeholder engagement, and examines Environmental, 
Social, and Governance (ESG) metrics overseen by the 
Corporate HSSE department.
	
The board receives regular updates on the company’s 
sustainability performance and progress towards ESG 
targets through the SDC. The committee ensures 
that stakeholder feedback informs decision-making 
processes, underscoring BPCL’s commitment to 
transparency and responsiveness.
2.	
Whether stakeholder consultation is used to 
support the identification and management of 
environmental, and social topics (Yes/No). If so, 
provide details of instances as to how the inputs 
received from stakeholders on these topics were 
incorporated into the policies and activities of the 
entity.
	
Stakeholder consultation plays a pivotal role in 
identifying areas for enhancement in corporate 
environmental and social endeavors. For instance:
	
When engaging in CSR initiatives or environmental 
conservation projects beyond BPCL’s boundaries, 
input and feedback from stakeholders such as 
communities and regulatory bodies are actively 
sought. BPCL consistently takes steps to enhance 
its products, such as transitioning from BS-IV to BS-
VI grade fuels, improving fuel and lubricant efficiency, 
tailoring fuels for colder climates, incorporating Ethanol 
blending in petrol, advancing toward renewable 
energy and biofuels, navigating the Energy Transition, 
establishing EV charging infrastructure, and developing 
a roadmap toward Net Zero emissions, all through 
collaboration with government bodies, customers, and 
other stakeholders.

Entity 
with 
Social 
Responsibility

effluent treatment plants before being recycled to a reverse osmosis-based demineralisation facility (RODM). Domestic 
sanitary water is processed in two Sewage Treatment Plants (STP), with the treated water recycled back to the effluent 
treatment plant.
	
Bina Refinery: Yes, BR has implemented mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD). The initiatives taken for the 
same are given below:
 
1) 
Effluent generated is treated in Latest technology membrane-based Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) of 9000 KLD 
capacity which includes Sequential Batch Reactor (SBR) and Membrane Bio Rector(MBR) having physical, chemical 
and biological treatment of wastewater. Treated effluent is further treated in Reverse Osmosis Demineralization 
plant (RO-DM) and used in boilers.
 
2. 
Robust waste water treatment, enabling to achieve 100% recycling of ETP treated water to RO plant
	
3.	
Recycling and treatment of storm channel water
	
4.	
Segregating and utilizing high TDS stream in DFDS system
 
5. 
Utilizing low TDS (<1500 ppm) RO reject water for green belt watering.

Annual Report 2023-24
10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices 
adopted in your establishments. Describe the 
strategy adopted by your company to reduce 
the usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in 
your products and processes and the practices 
adopted to manage such wastes.
 
1. 
Plastics (including packaging)
	
	
BPCL, a lubricant manufacturer and packaging 
company, is required to establish a system for 
managing plastic waste generated for product sales 
under Extended Producers Responsibility (EPR). In 
2023-24, BPCL’s Lubricant business unit collected 
4891 MT of plastic waste and reprocessed it through 
a CPCB-approved party, which used the processed 
plastic for various everyday use products.
 
2. 
E-waste
	
	
BPCL follows e-waste disposal guidelines as per 
E-waste Management Rules 2022. BPCL has 
also made a waste management manual for the 
benefit of locations. E-waste disposal is centrally 
monitored by IS Department. In FY 2023-24, 0 
tons of e-waste was disposed.
 
3. 
Hazardous waste
	
	
a.	
Spent Catalyst
 
 
 
BPCL 
refineries 
comply 
with 
CPCB 
regulations and recycle recoverable catalysts 
through licensed re-processors for metal 
recovery. Solid hazardous waste is disposed 
of in an approved SPCB facility, with safety 
features like impermeable liners and rain 
protection, and groundwater pollution levels 
are periodically monitored.
	
	
b.	
Slop oil
 
 
 
Oily sludge waste from equipment transfers, 
turnarounds, and routine operations is collected 
from refineries and sent to a weathering pit 
for oil recovery. The balance sludge quantity 
is either sent for Bioremediation/incineration 
or as per guidelines of Hazardous Waste 
Management. Slop oil from process units is 
reprocessed in a crude distillation column. 
Slop oil at marketing and pipeline locations is 
recycled before blending in the product system 
after ensuring product quality norms.
	
	
c.	
Oily Sludge
 
 
 
In refineries, oily sludge waste generated 
during handing over of equipment/tankages, 
turnarounds or routine operations etc. is 
collected and sent to weathering pit. After 
recovery of oil by chemical and mechanical 
methods, residual sludge from weathering pit 
is sent for Bioremediation which is a process 
that uses naturally occurring microorganizms 
to transform harmful substances to non-toxic 
compounds. As per Hazardous Waste Rules, 
2016, oil content in sludge waste should be 
less than 0.5% before it can be disposed-off.

Outcome of the initiative
1
Setting up of 2G Bio-Ethanol Plant BPCL is constructing a plant in Bargarh District, 
Odisha to produce 100 Kilo Liters per Day of 2nd 
Generation (2G) Bio-Ethanol and 1st Generation 
(1G) Bio-Ethanol. The plant will produce fuel 
grade Ethanol for blending in petrol, in line with 
the Government of India’s Ethanol Blended Petrol 
(EBP) Program and achieving 20% blending 
by 2025. The plant is in advanced stage of 
construction, which will be mechanically completed 
by October 2024 and final commissioning by March 
2025. The 2G plant will use 480 tons of agricultural 
waste (Rice straw) as feedstock, while the 1G plant 
will use 230 tons of surplus/damaged Rice grain. 
The plant will also use 300 tons of Rice straw daily 
as fuel in the boiler.
Expected total emission reduction from 
Bargarh Bio-refinery (at full design 
capacity) shall be around 1.1 lakh tons 
CO2 eq. per Year.

Development of High efficiency 
PNG Stove
LPG stoves available in the market gives a 
thermal efficiency of 68%. When the LPG stove 
is used for Piped Natural Gas (PNG) without any 
modification, its efficiency drops down to <45%. 
Hence, the PNG operator retrofits LPG stove 
for PNG use (change of injector only!). Although 
it improves the efficiency, it doesn’t regain the 
efficiency to full extent and remains at 55-60%. 
This calls for requirement of modification in burner 
top, pan support and the mixing tube. With this 
objective, BPCL Corporate R&D Center has 
developed a domestic stove of 74% efficiency for 
PNG use, tested at standard conditions.
An average household consumes 180-
200 SCM of NG annually, and a 15% 
efficiency increase can save 30 SCM 
of gas annually which is equivalent 
to reduction of 50-55 kg CO2 per 
household annually.

Waste Plastic Road
As part of Corporations initiative to address the 
EPR targets, CRDC developed a product from 
end-of-life plastic waste and developed a process 
for its environmentally friendly application in 
roads, RO’s, footpaths and allied applications. The 
product and process has been patented by BPCL. 
In view of getting the accreditation from competent 
authority, BPCL has signed an Memorandum of 
Agreement (MoA) with Central Road Research 
Institute, New Delhi (CSIR-CRRI) to undertake 
the feasibility study to use waste plastic in road 
construction. The report will assit in getting 
accreditation for BPCL process.
BPCL has successfully utilized 250 MT 
of plastic waste, preparing 14 waste 
plastic stretches across the country, 
and received EPR Certificate for its 
utilization. This has also helped in 
reduction of carbon emission to the 
extent of 750 MT CO2e.

Scale up of indigenous alkaline 
electrolyzer technology jointly with 
BARC.
Currently, electrolyzer technology for Green 
hydrogen production is available with only few 
foreign suppliers. BPCL has taken up a very 
ambitious initiative of scaling up India’s first and 
most efficient alkaline electrolyzer technology for 
Green Hydrogen production in collaboration with 
Bhabha Atomic Research Center (BARC). BPCL 
has led the initiative by entering into technology 
licensing with BARC, scaling up the electrolyzer 
components through third parties.
The technology demonstration of a 
500 kW electrolyser system is under 
construction and later shall be scaled 
up. This techonology will help in 
genereation of green hydrogen and 
reduction of carbon emissions.
5
Setting up EV charging stations
To promote the faster adoption of EVs in India 
market, BPCL is developing an EV charging 
ecosystem. BPCL has already set up 3135 EV 
charging stations till March 2024.
A robust charging network spread 
across country would address discovery 
and range anxiety of the EV customers 
and thus would lead to faster adoption 
of EVs. It will further lead to reduction in 
tailpipe emission from the vehicles.
