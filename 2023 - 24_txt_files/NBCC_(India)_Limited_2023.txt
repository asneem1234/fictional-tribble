Climate 
Change 
(Environment)
R
Risk – It is widely acknowledged in science that 
human activity is the primary cause of climate 
change, which has serious consequences. 
NBCC’s operations and the construction industry 
add to greenhouse gas emissions that expediate 
climate change. The performance of buildings 
can be directly impacted by climate change, 
raising maintenance costs and dangers to the 
occupants. Furthermore, shifting microclimates 
present problems for energy use and building 
design.
- Adopt energy management 
techniques (such as energy audits 
and renewable energy) to reduce 
the risk of GHG emissions sur-
passing expectations. 
-Tree Plantation initiatives as per 
applicable statutes. 
-Air pollution monitoring at all 
project sites to adhere to legal 
compliance and enhance air qual-
ity. 
-Regularly monitor and report 
GHG emissions to track progress 
and identify areas for improve-
ment.

Waste 
Management 
(Environment)
O/R
Opportunity – Waste management is identified 
as an opportunity due to its environmental 
benefits in reducing pollution and resource 
conservation through recycling and waste-
to-energy initiatives. 
It 
creates economic 
opportunities, job growth, and cost savings while 
complying with regulations. Improved waste 
management enhances community health and 
fosters innovation to combat climate change.
NBCC is still in the early phases of identifying its 
waste input/output, this presents a chance to 
implement improvements to our system. 
Risk- Waste management is recognized as a risk 
because of its possible environmental dangers, 
health effects, resource contamination, and 
contributions to climate change. Effective waste 
management is essential to reduce these risks 
and safeguard the environment and public 
health.

within 
our 
current 
safety 
mechanisms. 
Addressing these areas is crucial to mitigate the 
risk of unanticipated health and safety incidents 
in the future.
-Implementation of ISO45001:

Management System has been 
initiated in NBCC. This would help 
address the safety segment of our 
operations and ensure our safety 
related risks are under control.

IT Security
O/R
Opportunity- NBCC’s IT Security Policy is a 
comprehensive guideline that ensures a secure 
and safe system for the usage of information 
services and assets while protecting the 
organization from security threats. The record-
keeping and data maintenance are streamlined 
in NBCC by adopting an Employee Resource 
Planning (ERP) system.
To track, manage, and store digital documents, 
NBCC uses a Document Management System 
(DMS) that also reduces paper usage. Additionally, 
NBCC employs tech-friendly and transparent 
mechanisms through various applications such 
as E-office, Vendor Grievance Management 
System, E-billing, Technical Support System, and 
Building Management System.
NBCC is certified with ISO/IEC 27001 for 
Information Security Management Systems.
Risk- Information Technology (IT) security is a 
critical aspect of any organization’s operations. 
Failing to adequately protect digital assets and 
data can result in various risks and potential 
consequences. Key IT security risks include 
unauthorized access to sensitive information 
(data breaches), threats from malicious actors 
attempting to compromise systems (cyber 
attacks), vulnerabilities due to unpatched 
software 
(outdated 
software 
and 
patch 
management), insufficient restrictions on data 
access (inadequate access controls), unprotected 
data that can be intercepted (lack of encryption), 
and the loss of important information due to 
various factors (data loss). These risks can be 
mitigated by implementing robust internal 
controls and conducting regular audits.
By taking adequate measures and 
establishing robust internal con-
trols and timely audit processes, 
IT Security related risks may be 
prevented

Specific commitments, goals 
and targets set by the entity 
with defined timelines, if any
Our approach to achieving steady, profitable, competitive, and responsible 
growth is anchored in the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) objec-
tives we regularly set. In our last reporting period, we committed to adopting 
several key standards to demonstrate our dedication to ESG principles. These 
include ISO 26000 for Social Responsibility, ISO 20400 for Sustainable Procure-
ment, ISO 37001 for Anti-Bribery Management Systems, and ISO 45001 for 
Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems.

-
This year, these management systems will be fully operational, marking a sig-
nificant milestone in our ESG journey. By embedding these standards into our 
operational framework, we aim to solidify our commitment to ESG excellence, 
fostering a culture of continuous improvement, transparency, and accountabil-
ity. Our dedication to these principles not only strengthens our business but 
also contributes positively to the communities and environments in which we 
operate.
6.
Performance 
of 
the 
entity against the specific 
commitments, 
goals 
and 
targets along with reasons in 
case the same are not met.
As committed in the previous reporting period, we are currently in the process 
of implementing four key ISO standards: ISO 26000, ISO 20400, ISO 37001, and 
ISO 45001. These standards represent our dedication to social responsibility, 
sustainable procurement, anti-bribery measures, and occupational health and 
safety.
To achieve alignment with these ISO standards, we have undertaken a com-
prehensive restructuring of our practices. This involved a thorough review and 
revision of our existing policies and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to 
ensure they meet the stringent requirements set forth by each ISO standard.

Statement by director 
responsible for the business 
responsibility report, 
highlighting ESG related 
challenges, targets and 
achievements
Our dedication to delivering world-class projects drives NBCC’s leadership in 
the construction and infrastructure sector. Our projects, which include resi-
dential complexes, office buildings, hospitals, educational institutions, and ma-
jor infrastructure developments, are driven by a commitment to sustainability 
and excellence.
At NBCC, we recognize the importance of integrating evolving sustainability 
standards across all our operations. Our mission is to create a greener and 
more eco-friendly built environment. To this end, we are adopting green build-
ing practices, utilizing smart and efficient energy solutions, and minimizing en-
vironmental impacts such as pollution and waste generation, while ensuring 
stringent quality control throughout the construction process.
Our approach to achieving steady, profitable, competitive, and responsible 
growth is rooted in our Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) objec-
tives, which we regularly update. In line with our commitment from the last 
reporting period, we are currently focused on adopting several key ISO stan-
dards:
ISO 26000: Social Responsibility
ISO 20400: Sustainable Procurement
ISO 37001: Anti-Bribery Management Systems
ISO 45001: Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems
These management systems will be fully operational this year, further solidi-
fying our dedication to ESG excellence. Through our collective efforts, NBCC is 
committed to advancing our ESG performance and fostering a more sustain-
able and responsible built environment. Our focus on integrating key ISO stan-
dards, enhancing data accuracy, and maintaining rigorous governance practic-
es underscores our dedication to excellence and continuous improvement. We 
are confident that these initiatives will drive our company forward, ensuring 
steady, profitable, and responsible growth.

We deeply value the trust and support of our stakeholders and look forward to 
continuing this journey towards a greener, more inclusive future. Together, we 
will build not just structures, but a legacy of sustainability and social responsi-
bility that will benefit generations to come.

Does the entity have an anti-corruption or anti-bribery policy? If yes, provide details in brief and if available,

Yes, we have an Anti-corruption and Anti-bribery policy. NBCC is currently in the process of implementing a 
robust Anti-Bribery Management System, ISO37001. The policy for anti-corruption and anti-bribery has well-
defined clauses that establishes a zero-tolerance stance towards any form of corruption or bribery, ensuring 
adherence to legal standards and industry best practices. The policy emphasizes the responsibilities of employees 
and management in preventing, detecting, and reporting any unethical conduct. Regular training and awareness 
programs are mandated to keep everyone informed and vigilant.
	
NBCC also follows the guidelines issued by the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC), aimed at promoting 
transparency, integrity, and accountability in public administration. These guidelines serve as a framework for 
preventing corruption and ensuring good governance. Major areas the CVC guidelines help NBCC are preventive 
vigilance, whistleblower protection, proactive disclosures, investigation and prosecution. Apart from the 
guidelines, the organization has policies and protocols for Fraud Prevention and Detection, Whistle Blowing, 
Code of Conduct for ethics and transparency applicable to all employees. This acts as a series of layers that ensure 
accountability and transparency.

Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues.
	
A systematic procedure is used in the POSH grievance redressal mechanism for NBCC (India) Limited to handle 
allegations of sexual harassment. NBCC’s Policy for the Prevention of Sexual Harassment aims to create a safe 
and respectful workplace by preventing and addressing sexual harassment in compliance with the Indian 
Constitution and The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace Act, 2013. This policy applies to all employees 
and covers incidents during work-related activities and commutes. It outlines a structured complaint mechanism, 
with an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) responsible for handling complaints, conducting inquiries, and 
recommending actions while ensuring confidentiality. The policy emphasizes the employer’s role in maintaining 
a safe environment, providing education on acceptable behavior, and supporting aggrieved individuals. False 
accusations are taken seriously, and disciplinary actions against perpetrators include various corrective measures. 
The organization also has a Human Rights Policy, and an Internal and External Grievance Redressal Policy to cater 
to the needs and complaints of both internal and external stakeholders of the organization.

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complaints in discrimination and harassment cases.
	
The POSH Policy ensures a safe and respectful workplace for women by preventing and addressing sexual 
harassment. It applies to all employees, including temporary and contract workers, covering incidents both within 
and outside office premises. The policy establishes an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) to handle complaints 
confidentially and impartially, conduct thorough investigations, and recommend appropriate disciplinary actions. 
It mandates regular awareness and training programs, emphasizes the importance of confidentiality, and strictly 
prohibits retaliation against complainants or witnesses. Additionally, it addresses false accusations, ensuring 
fairness and integrity in handling complaints.
	
To prevent any adverse consequence for complaints in discriminations and harassment cases at our office in 
India, we take several proactive measures. The organization is dedicated to supporting the aggrieved individual 
through comprehensive services and resources during the entire process. Interim measures, recommended by 
the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC), may include transferring either the aggrieved woman or the respondent 
to another workplace within the organization to ensure a safe environment for the investigation. The aggrieved 
woman may also be granted a leave of absence up to three months, in addition to her regular leave entitlements, 
to recover and avoid workplace conflict. The ICC may recommend other specific forms of relief as per relevant 
regulations.

Describe the mechanisms to receive and redress grievances of the community
	
NBCC uses both a grievance mechanism developed internally and the government platform called CPGRAMS for 
their grievance redressal process. The Grievance Redressal SOP of NBCC establishes a transparent, efficient, and 
equitable mechanism for addressing grievances from internal (employees and senior management) and external 
stakeholders (contractors, vendors, customers, etc.). It outlines a structured procedure, specifying reporting 
channels, process flow, and detailed steps for grievance resolution at different levels. For internal stakeholders, 
grievances can be reported verbally, via written forms, or email, escalating from immediate superiors to the 
Chief Grievance Redressal Officer (CGRO) if needed. For external stakeholders, grievances are reported through 
written forms or email, escalating to the CGRO for unresolved issues. The SOP ensures accountability, timely 
resolution, feedback collection, and thorough documentation at each step to maintain trust and transparency. 
On the other hand, CPGRAMS or Centralized Public Grievance Redress and Monitoring System (CPGRAMS) is an 
online platform, a flagship initiative for the reformation in governance started by the Indian central government 
through addressing the grievances of general public. NBCC uses this portal to address grievances of communities 
and track lodged grievances, progress, and receive updates. The department concerned reviews the grievance 
and takes necessary action.

The Grievance Redressal SOP of NBCC establishes a transparent, efficient, and equitable mechanism for addressing 
grievances from internal (employees and senior management) and external stakeholders (contractors, vendors, 
customers, etc.). It outlines a structured procedure, specifying multiple reporting channels (verbal, written forms, 
email), clear process flow, and detailed steps for grievance resolution at different levels. The SOP features a 
Grievance Redressal Matrix involving immediate superiors, nodal representatives, and the Chief Grievance 
Redressal Officer (CGRO), with the Grievance Redressal Committee (GRC) involved as needed. Specific timelines 
for each stage ensure timely resolution, while clearly defined roles and responsibilities ensure accountability. 
The SOP includes a feedback mechanism for continuous improvement, a structured escalation process for 
unresolved issues, and emphasizes confidentiality to maintain trust. Comprehensive documentation and logging 
of grievances ensure proper tracking and compliance.
