A productive workforce is rooted in a 
healthy environment. By fostering a 
comfortable and supportive work 
atmosphere, OnMobile reduces job 
turnover, enhances job satisfaction, 
manages stress, and minimizes 
absenteeism. The company regularly 
engages in employee wellness 
initiatives, such as awareness programs 
and health checkups. OnMobile is 
committed to maintaining a fair 
workplace with strong policies 
supporting gender equality, diversity, 
and a harassment-free environment, as 
highlighted by its POSH Policy.
Talent management at OnMobile aligns 
the work culture with global standards, 
boosting employee loyalty and 
eĨciency. Recruiting locally not only 
helps retain talent but also 
demonstrates the company's 
commitment to community 
development.
To support the overall well-being of 
its employees, OnMobile has 
partnered with YourDost to oĪer a 
24/7 counseling service that is free 
and conĦdential. This platform also 
includes additional resources like 
community connections, lifestyle and 
mental wellness blogs, articles, and 
webinars focused on self-
improvement and mental health. 
Additionally, OnMobile employs a 
Talent Acquisition Procedure to 
ensure the recruitment of highly 
skilled professionals capable of 
delivering top-tier services to clients 
worldwide.
OnMobile, as a provider of mobile 
entertainment products and solutions, 
can gain advantages by prioritizing 
customer-centricity. This involves 
tailoring products and services to 
match customer needs and 
preferences, which can help attract 
new customers and retain current 
ones. However, focusing on customer-
centricity also comes with notable 
risks, such as the costs involved and 
the risk of users engaging in excessive 
mobile game usage.
By addressing the associated risks, 
OnMobile can capitalize on the 
beneĦts of customer-centricity and 
maintain its competitive position in the 
market. Our products cater to a diverse 
customer base, making it crucial to 
consistently simulate, evaluate, and 
reĦne our product development 
strategies to align with customer 
interests and engagement.
OnMobile plans to introduce features 
that enable users to monitor and 
control their gaming time, along with 
providing resources on responsible 
gaming. Additionally, OnMobile is 
committed to strictly following 
mandated warnings and guidelines, 
including those pertaining to children's 
content, set by regulatory authorities 
for gaming companies where 
applicable.

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets and 
achievements
Dear Stakeholders,
It is with great pleasure that I present the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report for OnMobile Global Limited for 
the Ħscal year 2023-24. Our commitment to integrating Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles deeply into 
our business operations and strategic decision-making continues to strengthen and evolve. We recognize the critical 
importance of these elements in sustaining business excellence and ethical practices.
Commitment to Excellence and Sustainability
At OnMobile, we are dedicated to maintaining the highest levels of quality, superior service management, robust 
information security, and sustainable business continuity. These pillars are fundamental to our operational integrity and 
success, ensuring we deliver exceptional value consistently to all our stakeholders.
Environmental Initiatives
Our environmental stewardship initiatives are more crucial than ever as we strive to minimize our impact on the planet. This 
year, we have enhanced our eĪorts by implementing advanced energy-eĨcient lighting systems, expanding our water 
conservation measures, and strengthening our waste management practices. These initiatives are designed not only to 
reduce our environmental footprint but also to set a benchmark in sustainable operations within our industry.
Social Contributions
We believe in empowering the communities in which we operate. This year, we have ampliĦed our eĪorts to create a safe and 
healthy working environment for our employees and extended our community engagement initiatives. Our ongoing 
partnerships with the Sri Kanchi Kamakoti Medical Trust - Sankara Eye Foundation and VAANI Deaf Children's Foundation 
have enabled us to make signiĦcant contributions to healthcare and education. Additionally, we have expanded our skill-
building programs, aiming to equip underprivileged youth with the necessary skills for a sustainable future.
Governance and Ethical Practices
Upholding rigorous standards of governance and transparency remains a top priority. We have strengthened our compliance 
mechanisms and internal controls, ensuring adherence to all applicable laws and regulations. Our robust whistle-blower 
policy continues to be a vital tool for maintaining transparency and addressing stakeholder concerns eĪectively.
Achievements and Future Goals
In the Ħnancial year 2024, we achieved several signiĦcant milestones in our ESG journey:
Ÿ
We achieved a notable reduction in carbon emissions and implemented a comprehensive waste segregation and 
recycling program across all our oĨces.
Ÿ
We Have implemented employee wellness program to promote health and well-being among our staĪ.
Ÿ
We have improved our approach to ensure and adhere to legal standards and ethical practices by empowering our ethics 
and compliance committee.
Looking ahead to Ħnancial year 2025, we have set ambitious targets to further enhance our ESG performance:
