(Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) is the practice of companies disclosing information about their 
environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance. It goes beyond financial reporting to provide stakeholders with a 
comprehensive view of a company’s non-financial impacts and contributions to sustainable development. BRSR covers 
topics such as environmental impact, social responsibility, and governance practices, aiming to promote transparency and 
accountability.)

1.
Climate change
R
The pressing issue of climate 
change has underscored the 
necessity 
to 
enhance 
the 
resilience of urban regions. Many 
infrastructures and public areas 
weren’t planned to cope with the 
environmental 
challenges 
we 
currently face, including severe 
weather conditions, air pollution, 
energy 
deficits, 
and 
water 
scarcity. Tackling climate change 
demands 
the 
expansion 
of 
innovative solutions in areas such 
as energy, efficiency, material use, 
and beyond. Government policies 
are catalyzing a shift towards 
eco-friendly construction. The 
climate action agenda presents 
commercial opportunities that 
empower us to aid in climate 
change adaptation and reduction.
Potential 
alterations 
brought 
on by climate change, such as 
regulatory modifications, shifts 
in consumer preferences, and 
other substantial changes in the 
Company’s operational context, 
could also significantly affect the 
business and poses a risk.
As an organization, 
we recognize 
the imperative to 
address carbon 
emissions as 
a risk. We are 
committed to 
adopting proactive 
measures, including 
investing in clean 
technologies, 
optimizing 
energy efficiency, 
and promoting 
sustainable 
practices. By taking 
decisive action, we 
aim to mitigate our 
carbon footprint 
and contribute to a 
greener, low-carbon 
future.

2.
Circularity, 
including 
materials and 
resources 
efficiency
R
The Company is in construction 
business and the disruption in 
operations could have the risk 
of creating an adverse economic 
impact. The link between circular 
flows and climate emissions 
is clear, and increasing circular 
material flows could help reduce 
climate impact. Circularity and 
resource efficiency are linked 
to operational efficiency and 
reduced environmental impact.
The Company may 
adopt measures 
that promote 
circular practices, 
such as utilizing 
recycled materials, 
implementing 
efficient waste 
management, and 
prioritizing resource 
conservation. 
By embracing 
circularity, we 
aim to minimize 
environmental 
impact and 
contribute to 
a sustainable 
construction 
industry
Negative
3.
Occupational 
health and 
safety
R
The 
Group 
is 
engaged 
in 
executing potentially hazardous 
projects that necessitate ongoing 
supervision and administration 
of 
health 
and 
safety 
risks. 
Neglecting 
to 
handle 
these 
risks could lead to serious 
consequences, such as causing 
fatal or life-altering injuries to 
our employees, subcontractors, 
external 
individuals, 
or 
the 
general public. Additionally, it 
could expose us to the possibility 
of 
legal 
action, 
substantial 
penalties, disqualification from 
tender participation, and damage 
to our reputation.
We have 
implemented 
comprehensive 
risk mitigation 
measures to ensure 
occupational health 
and safety. These 
include regular 
safety training 
programs, strict 
adherence to safety 
protocols, regular 
inspections. We 
prioritize the use of 
personal protective 
equipment (PPE), 
conduct risk 
assessments, 
and promote 
a culture of 
proactive reporting 
and continuous 
improvement.

4.
Corporate 
Governance 
and Business 
Ethics
R
Failure to adhere to the Code of 
Ethics may result from a lack of 
adherence to a risk compliance 
approach; an absence of a 
suitable 
corporate 
culture; 
a deficient training program 
and 
compliance 
monitoring; 
lack of a robust testing and 
monitoring regime; inadequate 
whistleblowing procedures and 
a lack of awareness about these 
channels across the organization; 
or deliberate or negligent non-
compliance. 
Non-compliance 
with the Code of Ethics can leave 
the Group vulnerable to incidents 
of bribery and corruption, fraud, 
deception, 
false 
declarations 
or falsified accounting, unfair 
competitive 
practices, 
and 
violations of human rights such 
as child labor, illegal labor, etc. 
Such 
failures 
could 
trigger 
legal investigations or disputes, 
causing business disruptions, 
financial losses, hefty fines and 
penalties, 
reputational 
harm, 
and 
exclusion 
from 
future 
opportunities
At our organization, 
we have robust 
policies and 
procedures in place 
to ensure effective 
risk mitigation and 
promote sound 
governance and 
business ethics. 
We adhere to 
strict regulatory 
standards, conduct 
regular audits, 
and maintain a 
strong compliance 
framework. Our 
employees are 
educated on ethical 
practices, and we 
foster a culture 
of transparency, 
accountability, and 
integrity across 
all levels of our 
organization.
Negative
5.
Human Rights 
& Labor 
Conditions
R
Companies need to ensure that 
they are not indirectly involved in 
human rights abuses. Violations 
like poor working conditions, 
modern 
slavery, 
child 
labor, 
or 
environmental 
infractions 
at work locations/sites or by 
subcontractors or suppliers in our 
supply chain can inflict harm on 
individuals and the environment. 
Such transgressions can lead 
to 
reputational 
damage, 
a 
loss of trust in the Company’s 
responsibility, and can result in 
fines, penalties, civil litigation, 
and 
criminal 
prosecution. 
It 
is essential for businesses to 
respect and support the principles 
of freedom of association and 
the effective recognition of the 
right to collective bargaining. 
Furthermore, 
businesses 
must 
actively 
work 
towards 
eliminating all forms of forced 
and compulsory labor.
We prioritize 
human rights and 
labor conditions 
by implementing 
comprehensive 
policies and 
practices that 
mitigate risks. 
Our organization 
strictly adheres 
to regulatory 
compliances and 
labor standards. 
We promote fair 
treatment, non-
discrimination, safe 
working conditions, 
and provide 
appropriate training 
and support to 
our employees, 
ensuring their rights 
and wellbeing are 
upheld

Supply chain 
management
R
As a responsible business, it 
entails conducting operations 
in a fair and ethical manner, 
prioritizing integrity in decision 
making, and establishing trust 
as a reliable partner within the 
supply chain. Sustainable supply 
chains are crucial in ensuring 
safe and equitable conditions for 
all stakeholders. Any disruptions 
or shortages of materials and 
labor can lead to both financial 
and nonfinancial repercussions, 
such as environmental or safety 
incidents, violations of human 
rights within the supply chain, 
compromised ability to meet 
customer 
expectations 
and 
project commitments, damage to 
reputation due to suppliers and 
subcontractors acting contrary 
to the Company’s values, and 
potential fines, penalties, and 
lawsuits.
We have 
implemented 
various risk 
mitigation 
measures in our 
supply chain 
management to 
ensure operational 
efficiency. 
This includes 
establishing 
reliable supplier 
networks, and 
maintaining strong 
relationships. We 
have streamlined 
processes for 
timely supplies 
and inventory 
management, 
ensuring 
uninterrupted 
operations.
Negative
7.
Waste & 
Hazardous 
Materials 
Management
R
One of the key areas of focus is 
the advancement of a circular 
model 
that 
emphasizes 
the 
reduction 
and 
optimization 
of material usage, as well as 
effective waste management. By 
optimizing resources, businesses 
can 
enhance 
operational 
and financial efficiency while 
simultaneously 
minimizing 
waste 
generation. 
Neglecting 
proper 
waste 
management 
practices can lead to inefficient 
utilization of raw materials and 
an escalation in production costs
We prioritize proper 
waste management 
practices to 
mitigate risks 
associated with 
waste and materials 
management. 
Our organization 
has implemented 
protocols for the 
storage, handling, 
and disposal of 
waste. We ensure 
compliance with 
all applicable 
regulations and 
industry best 
practices

Water 
usage and 
management
R/O
Risk:
Water plays a vital role in 
construction activities and has 
significant implications for the 
environment 
throughout 
its 
extraction, usage, and discharge 
processes. Given the growing 
strain on water resources and 
the imperative to protect the 
natural environment, effective 
control and management of 
water resources have become 
crucial. Thus, it is essential 
to encourage the responsible 
and 
efficient 
use 
of 
water, 
along with the development of 
infrastructure that promotes its 
conservation in a sustainable and 
environmentally-friendly manner. 
Identifying 
and 
mitigating 
water-related 
risks, 
as 
well 
as 
implementing 
responsible 
management 
procedures, 
are necessary steps towards 
achieving these goals.
Opportunity:
Implementing 
effective 
water 
usage 
and 
management 
practices 
not 
only 
reduces 
costs but also mitigates the 
adverse effects of groundwater 
depletion and water pollution. 
By optimizing water utilization, 
businesses can achieve cost 
savings 
while 
simultaneously 
minimizing their contribution to 
the depletion of groundwater 
sources and pollution of water 
bodies.
We understand 
the importance of 
water management 
and subsequently, 
the Company shall 
put in efforts for 
efficient water 
conservation 
techniques, 
monitor water 
consumption and 
to identify areas 
for improvement. 
Additionally, ensure 
compliance with 
environmental 
standards and 
minimizing water-
related risks.

Quality of 
Products and 
Project delivery
O
Quality serves as a crucial 
competitive advantage in the 
construction 
sector, 
which 
requires high levels of technical 
sophistication. 
Organizations 
must 
adhere 
to 
quality 
standards to effectively identify 
and fulfil customer needs and 
priorities. Failure to meet quality 
expectations 
or 
encountering 
issues related to customer health 
and safety can pose potential 
risks, including a decline in sales 
and damage to reputation

The

of 
customers

Environmental

R
Companies share a reciprocal 
relationship with the natural 
environment, 
relying 
on 
its 
resources while also having 
an impact on it. Consequently, 
it is imperative for companies 
to prioritize the mitigation of 
biodiversity and natural resource 
impacts throughout their projects

operations. 
Assessing 
ecosystem services that directly 
affect the Company is essential. 
Protecting 
and
