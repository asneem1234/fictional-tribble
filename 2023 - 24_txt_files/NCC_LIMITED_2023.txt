12.	 Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy workplace.
	
As a part of the HSE management system, a project specific HSE plan is prepared at the inception of every new project that 
determines the broad parameters of HSE Management. This HSE plan Identifies the hazardous operations and the risk arising 
from such hazards which are within the scope of the work.  It even specifies the required integrated preventive measures 
(Controls) to mitigate the same.
	
The Management provides strong demonstrable visible leadership and commitment towards HSE through personal examples 
and actions.  This is the first principle of NCC L.I.F.E. (Live Injury Free Each Day) leadership commitment.  Management has 
participated in HSE meetings, conducted site Inspections and HSE Audits, to encourage and develop a positive attitude towards 
HSE within NCC Projects and operations.  Management ensured that sufficient HSE resources were available and allocated 
responsibilities for implementing the NCC LIFE framework.  Roles & Responsibilities, targets & objectives, goals, training needs 
& required behaviours had been clearly defined, agreed & communicated throughout the entire organization and structure.
	
To support this further, there is a systematic risk management process in place to identify and control all the hazards in projects 
/ units which requires verification of conformity.  The HSE management system has various procedures and norms.  Therefore, a 
process has been established for carrying out Internal HSE Audits.  This process mandates to organize internal audits for all active 
projects and it is verified by Head Office Audit Team at least once in six months.  Certain Projects were selected for frequent 
auditing, depending on their status, importance, and risk profile.  This was in addition to any external audits carried out by 
accredited auditors.

15.	 Provide details of any corrective action taken or underway to address safety-related incidents (if any) and on significant risks / 
concerns arising from assessments of health and safety practices and working conditions.
	
Every project of the Company’s Safety Committee undertakes a review of all accidents and incidents, and formulate procedures 
based on risk analysis of data gathered through respective Project sites. This data is used for predictive analysis, measurement of 
incidents and unsafe behaviors. This enables identification of the key areas of risk which in turn guides the projects to proactively 
manage and focus resources to prevent any accidents or incidents. Such analysis is shared throughout the group to support NCC 
Mission Safe Working Environment ZERO accident objective. 
	
In view of this collective approach, efforts have been made in understanding the Company’s high- risk profile holistically as well 
as in general. HSE risk management culture has been inculcated across the Company. Various steps have been taken including: 
• 	
Implementation of HSE  Surveillance Rating 
• 	
Developed HSE Training Modules on high-risk activities. 
NCC LIMITED

• 	
Developed standardized template of HSE Lessons Learnt and these alerts are shared in the centralized knowledge sharing 
platform which can be accessed by all employees. 
• 	
Enrolled Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) into the HSE Management Community of central knowledge sharing module. 
• 	
Implementation of senior management audits based on standard checklist  developed by the HSE Council. 
	
The outcome of the efforts has been to capture the high-risk hazardous activities ubiquitous in various NCC’s Business verticals. 
This helps to devise an action plan to enhance the competency among stakeholders in managing such activities with higher 
degree of awareness and suitable training from competent external agencies as well as subject matter experts. Each employee 
of the organisation strives to achieve HSE excellence in their respective functions and align their actions and business decisions.
