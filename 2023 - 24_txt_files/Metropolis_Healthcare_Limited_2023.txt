(Indicate

1
Energy 
management
Opportunity Energy-intensive operations NA
Positive 
impact: It 
leads to 
reductions in 
emissions and 
costs.
2
Waste 
management
Risk
Biomedical waste is 
generated due to the nature 
of the business.
The disposal process is managed by 
a government-authorized partner. 
Waste is separated into various 
coloured bags with barcodes. Before 
transferring it to an authorized vendor, 
the waste is weighed, and all safety 
protocols are observed from the point 
of generation until it is handed over to 
the authority.
Negative 
impact: 
Improper 
disposal 
could lead to 
the spread of 
diseases and 
jeopardize the 
Company’s 
social license 
to operate.
3
Employee 
health & 
safety
Risk
When safety measures are 
insufficient, employees are 
more likely to experience 
injuries or health issues, 
resulting in increased 
sick leave and decreased 
overall work efficiency. 
Additionally, a lack of 
focus on safety can lower 
employee morale and trust 
in the organization, further 
impacting productivity 
and overall workplace 
satisfaction. Therefore, 
prioritizing health and 
safety is essential for 
maintaining a productive 
and motivated workforce.
Well-being, safety, and health have 
always been our top priorities. We 
have designed and planned our 
labs and related infrastructure in a 
manner that ensures safety levels 
as per prescribed standards and 
norms. We have segregated our office 
and lab areas and ensure that we 
undertake periodic fire and electricity 
safety checks. We have formulated 
policies and guidelines to assess and 
mitigate various hazards and risks. 
The associated risk assessment 
procedures are mentioned in the 
safety manual. We also conduct 
regular safety audits through the 
Quality Assurance department to 
ensure compliance.
Negative 
impact: 
Revenue loss, 
recruitment 
difficulties, 
and 
operational 
challenges.

Metropolis has implemented

potential internal and external 
violations and penetration attempts.
We are also following the best 
practices, Digital Personal Data 
Protection Act (DPDPA), and 
ISO 27701, Privacy Information 
Management System (PIMS) standard 
for safeguarding patient privacy and 
securing patients’ electronic health 
records.
Negative 
impact: Loss 
of brand

leading to 
potential 
declines in the 
Company's

growth.

Specific commitments, goals 
and targets set by the entity with 
defined timelines, if any.
As a responsible organization, the Company is committed to the NGRBC principles 
and focuses on energy conservation, water and waste management, diversity, 
women's leadership, and accountable governance. We have set specific targets for 
the ten key materiality topics and will report progress regularly.
Our goals include achieving carbon neutrality by 2043, reducing emissions intensity 
by 45% by 2030, and reaching zero waste in offices by 2030 while cutting plastic 
usage by 50%. We aim to reduce water intensity by 30% by 2030 and achieve water 
neutrality by 2043. In quality of care, we will resolve 100% of service complaints 
registered in our CRM year-on-year and maintain an NPS of 90% by 2028.
We are committed to 100% OHS and ISO 15189 training for all employees and aim 
for a 50:50 gender balance in our workforce by 2028. We also plan to positively 
impact 600,000 beneficiaries by 2043 and maintain zero data breaches year-on-year, 
upholding ISO 27001 and 27701 certifications.
Our risk management involves annual risk assessments and mitigation plans to 
ensure ongoing resilience and compliance.

The Company has made significant progress during the financial year 2023-24, in 
meeting its commitments. We achieved a 30% reduction in energy emissions through 
scheduled HVAC Operations, LED Lights implementation, and through consuming 
30% of our power from renewable sources.
In quality of care, we reached an NPS of 87, reduced detractors from 4% to 3%, and 
collected over 30,000 NPS responses monthly. Our phlebotomist rating was 4.7/5, 
with over 50,000 monthly CRM interactions.
Our gender diversity ratio is 43% female to 57% male, with 36% of our training goals 
met. The Company successfully accomplished ISO 27001 and 27701 certifications, 
affirming our commitment to information security and privacy management. While 
we’ve met many targets, ongoing efforts are needed to address unmet goals and 
sustain progress.
