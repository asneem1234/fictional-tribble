1
Circular 
Economy
O
With shrinking natural resources and 
increased cost of material, transitioning to 
circular models has become very important.
We are committed to efficient 
resource consumption and 
optimized 
packaging 
with 
zero compromise on product 
quality and safety. Most of 
our products are recyclable 
in 
nature. 
Combating 
challenges such as cost, 
market 
performance, 
consumer 
protection, 
as 
well as water and waste 
management, we ensure our 
packaging is fit-for-purpose 
and made from low- impact 
material, or material, which 
is reusable or recyclable at 
the end of its life.
Positive

Product 
Stewardship
R
Poor quality or contamination could result 
in safety issues, reputational damage, 
financial 
losses, 
and 
product 
recalls. 
Consumers are also increasingly curious 
about the impacts of various lifecycle 
stages of the products they consume, 
including packing material used and waste 
generated.
We 
have 
established 
a 
company-wide 
quality 
assurance programme, along 
with product testing and 
traceability 
programmes. 
We engage with suppliers to 
establish and maintain clear 
and stringent norms for raw 
material safety and quality.

Talent, 
Training & 
Education
O
Proficient employees constitute a valuable 
asset for the company. Well-trained workers 
execute their duties more effectively, 
requiring less time and minimizing the risk 
of injuries
Positive
4.
Governance
R/O
Governance is both a risk and an opportunity 
for an organization. Effective governance 
mitigates risks by ensuring compliance 
and ethical practices, reducing legal and 
reputational threats. Simultaneously, it 
presents an opportunity for organizations 
to enhance their reputation, build trust, and 
achieve long-term sustainability, fostering 
growth and success. Balancing governance 
practices is crucial for navigating risks and 
capitalizing on opportunities.
Our 
strategies 
include 
a 
clear 
and 
transparent 
communication 
channel. 
Regular risk assessment to 
identify and address potential 
governance vulnerability. We 
have invested in ongoing 
training for leadership and 
staff to enhance governance 
understanding and practices.
Positive
5
Employee & 
Health Risk
R
Neglecting 
the 
significance 
of 
health 
and safety measures can bring negative 
consequences to the company. These 
consequences 
might 
include 
possible 
increases in legal costs, a decrease in the 
availability of workers, lower employee 
morale, and in severe situations, it could 
jeopardize 
the 
company’s 
operational 
stability.

VIP Industries has cultivated a dynamic work culture that fosters passion, talent, inquisitiveness, empowerment, and 
diversity. Within our organization, individuals have the opportunity to expand their horizons both laterally and vertically. 
Our foundation is built upon core values such as youthfulness, meritocracy, entrepreneurship, and innovation.
Our management team consists of seasoned professionals with extensive experience, energy, and a strong commitment 
to realizing our bold mission of becoming the world’s foremost luggage brand. With diverse backgrounds, expertise from 
various industries, and a wealth of skills, our dedicated team is poised to elevate VIP from a national brand to a global 
leader. We operate on an open-door policy, extending inclusivity to our employees, former staff, and business partners, 
fostering a sense of unity within the ‘One VIP community.’
To boost employee morale, numerous digital initiatives were launched, such as virtual health challenges with gamified 
elements, wellness sessions, online interactions with HR and leadership, and engaging activities aimed at fostering a fun 
work environment.
Numerous training sessions were conducted for both management and sales staff over the course of the year. A 
specialized workshop was organized for the product and design team, while induction training was offered to new hires. Key 
administrative processes such as leave management, attendance tracking, onboarding, business expense reimbursements, 
and travel arrangements were digitized throughout the year. These initiatives collectively fostered a positive workplace 
culture and contributed to improved performance levels.
We have implemented the VIP Employee Stock Appreciation Rights Plan, 2018 (ESARP 2018), wherein employees of the 
Company and its subsidiaries have the privilege of receiving Employee Stock Appreciation Rights (ESAR). These rights allow 
them to benefit from the future increase in the Company's share value, as predetermined, and are settled through the 
allotment of company shares. Our ESARP 2018 Plan adheres to the regulations outlined in the SEBI (Share Based Employee 
Benefits and Sweat Equity) Regulations, 2021.

PRINCIPLE 6: Businesses should respect and make efforts to protect and restore the environment
We are dedicated to environmental sustainability, endeavoring to maintain a delicate equilibrium between economic 
advancement and environmental preservation, with a conscientious consideration for ecological aspects. Regular 
identification and assessment of potential environmental risks associated with our business activities are integral to 
our operational approach. We consistently develop innovative strategies and initiatives to tackle global environmental 
challenges such as climate change and global warming. This involves ongoing efforts to reduce and optimize the utilization 
of energy, water, raw materials, and logistics, coupled with extensive tree plantation initiatives.
As an illustrative example, we have implemented measures such as replacing high-pressure vapor lamps with energy-
efficient LED lights in shop floors and streets. Additionally, the installation of a timer control system for lighting in specified 
areas within manufacturing plants and shop floors, along with the replacement of outdated air compressors with more 
energy-efficient alternatives, underscores our proactive stance in environmental conservation.
We have also worked on technological improvements in forming machine for reducing the heating time of double station 
machines, induction of air saving control valve to reduce the air wastage during idle department operations, induction of 
temperature control system for fan switching ON/OFF for cooling tower in place of fan being continuously ON, replacement 
of old oil based technology HT breaker into latest vacuum type HT breaker and recycling of used stretch wrap film in 
molding of accessories.
