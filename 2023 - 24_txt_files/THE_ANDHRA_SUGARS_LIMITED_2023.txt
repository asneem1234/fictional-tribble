26) Overview of the entity's material responsible business conduct issues:
As diversified enterprise, ASL continues of occasion a system-based approach to Business Risk Manage-
ment. The Management of risk is embedded in the corporate strategies of developing a portfolio of world-
class Businesses that best matches with organizational capability with market opportunities, focusing on
building distributed leadership and succession planning processes, nurturing talent and enhancing organi-
zational capabilities through timely developmental inputs.
Please indicate material responsible business conduct and sustainability issues pertaining to environmental

(Indicatepositive
or negative
implications)
1
Renewable
Power
Opportunity
Reduction of pollu-
tion and protection
of the environment.
The company pro-
poses for sourcing
up of  renewable
energy  like Solar,
Green Hydrogen
etc. that will help in
reducing 
Gree
House 
Gases
(GHG) emissions.
Initially because
of higher Capex,
this will be nega-
tive but in me-
dium to long term
it will be positive.
2
Raw material
(Sugarcane
availability)
Risk
Continuous
drop in the avail-
ability of Sugar
Cane.
Sourcing of sugar-
cane 
produced
through sustain-
able farming prac-
tices 
viz.,
Mechanisation of
Plantation and Har-
vesting, Timely
payment to farmers
and payment of
Cane price more
than the FRP fixed
by Govt.
Inspite of various
approaches to
mitigate this risk,
still plantation lev-
els are not en-
couraging. This
might be negative
in the Medium
Term/ Long Term.

Energy
Management
Risk &
Opportunity
Power being one of
the Major input for
Chlor Alkali and
other Segments.
Availability of Qual-
ity Power at rea-
sonable price is al-
ways a matter of
concern. The com-
pany has setup
Coal Based cap-
tive Power Plant for
augmenting power
requirements for its
captive use.
To effectively manage
the risks associated
with energy manage-
ment, the company is
undertaking the fol-
lowing approaches:
1.Energy Efficiency
efforts: Implementing
energy-efficient tech-
nologies, equipment
upgrades, and pro-
cess optimization to
minimize energy con-
sumption.
2. To reduce reliance
on non-renewable en-
ergy sources.
3. Renewable Energy
Integration: Exploring
and investing in re-
newable 
energy
sources, such as so-
lar and Green Hydro-
gen to diversify the
energy mix and de-
crease dependence
on fossil fuels.
Risk:
Negative Finan-
cial Implications:
Inefficient energy
consumption can
lead to higher en-
ergy costs, im-
pacting 
the
company's profit-
ability.
Opportunity:
Adopting energy-
efficient practices
and integrating
renewable energy
sources can re-
sult in cost sav-
ings over the long
term.
4
Volatile
Market
Trends
Risk
Prices of the Im-
ported Raw Mate-
rials are highly
volatile. Further
volatility in the seg-
ments where the
Company's prod-
ucts are sold is al-
ways a matter of
concern.
To address the
risks associated
with volatile market
trends, the com-
pany is implement-
ing the following
approach: i.e., Di-
versification 
of
Customer Base
and to enhance
supply chain resil-
ience and exploring
various possibilities
for reducing costs
of Key elements
such as power etc.
and investing con-
tinuously in Tech-
nology advance-
ment.

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy
adopted by your company to reduce us age of hazardous and  toxic chemicals in your products and
processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
We have adopted reduce, reuse, and recycle concepts in waste management.The waste generated in
our complex is broadly categorized into different types of wastes viz. solid waste and liquid waste.The
solid waste generated is further segregated into incinerable waste and land fill waste.Incinerable waste
like spent carbon is recycled to cement industries for co-processing / authorized recyclers.
The other hazardous waste (land fillable) is sent to TSDF, Parawada.  Part of the land fillable waste is
being disposed in houses in the secured land fill facility. Waste oil and e-waste are disposed to authorized
recyclers.  Used lead acid batteries are disposed to the battery manufacturers on a buy back basis.
Our Company is encouraging the usage of non-asbestos roof sheets in place of hazardous asbestos
roof sheets for the structural buildings.
Depending on the nature of the liquid wastes, they are treated using different types ofpollution control
technologies, such as anaerobic and aerobic treatment systems, reverse osmosis and multiple effect
evaporation systems and making them zero liquid discharge where-ever possible.
