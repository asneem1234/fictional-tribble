Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, 
targets, and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
Exide has always been at the forefront of embracing and adopting sustainable practices, as it is deeply embedded in our
corporate philosophy. Our business strategy seamlessly incorporates ESG-related targets and challenges into the decision-
making processes, which enables us to plan mitigation strategies for material topics under the ESG pillars.
We are committed to reducing our environmental footprint, by conserving energy, preserving water, and minimising waste.
We are focusing on improving resource efficiency, responsible sourcing of materials, promoting circular economy through
recycling and increasing the share of recycled materials in product development. We continuously strive to improve our
product portfolio by delivering new-age eco-friendly products and solutions through sustainable innovations and deployment
of advanced technologies.
Green energy accounts for 20% of our energy consumption and we are making additional investments in wind and solar
projects. We contribute to circular economy as nearly three-fourth of the key raw material (lead and lead alloys) is recycled
in nature. Exide has three lead and lead-alloy smelting facilities, operating under our subsidiary Chloride Metals Limited
(CML). We source nearly 45% of our recycled lead from our own subsidiary, CML. Recognizing the significance of digital
transformation, we have embraced technology breakthroughs and implemented digital solutions to improve process efficiency 
and resource optimisation. Exide has deployed electric vehicles for last-mile goods deliveries, making its value chain greener
and more sustainable.
Our employees are our greatest assets, and we have always worked to create a progressive and safe work environment
facilitating their growth and development. All our employees and workers are covered under accidental and health insurance.
We uphold the highest health & safety standards and have obtained ISO 45001 certification to guarantee the wellbeing of
employees and workers across all offices and production sites.
With a deep sense of responsibility towards inclusive growth of the Company, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is rooted
in the core strategy of the Company to benefit local communities. As a responsible corporate, we foster the development of
local communities in the areas of health, education, environment, empowerment, and employability ensuring sustainable and
long-term growth.
We have strong Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) and Governance frameworks that are built on the values of transparency,
accountability, and excellence in order to run the business in a responsible and ethical manner while safeguarding and
protecting the interests of all stakeholders. We enhanced our procedures, systems, practices, and internal controls to reduce
strategic, reputational, ESG, compliance, operational, and financial risks. Adopted frameworks for risk management and
governance are in line with the Company’s sustainability vision and business plan.
With persistent and collective efforts towards sustainable development, a shared commitment is firmly ingrained in Exide’s
business operations and among stakeholders for reducing environmental footprint, contributing to the welfare of the society,
and running the business with integrity.

The Company ensures adherence to a fair and accessible grievance redressal process aligned to its core values and meeting 
statutory guidelines. All efforts are made to follow a transparent investigation process for resolving employee/worker grievances 
in a timely and satisfactory manner. As part of this effort, any unresolved employee grievances are directed to the Apex Grievance 
Redressal Committee / Forum, which is the highest-level forum for redressal of grievances. The Committee, comprising of Senior 
management, monitors and evaluates each grievance and the appropriate next step is taken. 
In the factories, the Company has a proactive grievance identification process. Periodically, a collective meeting is conducted with 
workers, where feedback is taken, and any grievances are registered for subsequent action. At the regions, there are designated 
business HR partners to handle employee grievances. Depending on the nature of the issue and attributed factors of grievance, 
the HR department develops a resolution plan and assigns a Single Point of Contact (SPOC) for resolution. Upon completion of 
resolution action, the feedback is taken for satisfactory closure of grievance. Weekly department and functional level interactions 
and feedback sessions are conducted with third-party service provider representatives and the HR team to resolve grievances, if 
any. We also have a robust Whistle Blower Policy to encourage employees to raise concerns against any suspected illegal activity.
Specifically, employee and worker grievances are to be directed to the e-mail: grievance@exide.co.in

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases
Exide encourages reporting of discrimination and harassment cases, maintaining a strict policy against any such incidents with
appropriate measures to prevent any adverse consequences to the complainant. The Company has a Sexual Harassment Avoidance 
Redressal policy in place, in accordance with which redressal committees have been formed at the Apex, factory and regional levels.
Retaliation against any employee who report or provide information about sexual harassment or unwelcome or unacceptable
behavior that might constitute sexual harassment is strictly prohibited. Any act of reprisal, including internal interface, coercion
and restraint by an employee or one acting on his/her behalf violates this policy and will result in appropriate disciplinary action.

any grievances they face, irrespective of the magnitude of the problem. The POSH training is mandated for all employees and
workers of the Company.

which ensures that customer values are optimised, and the batteries perform as expected. The Company investigates all

complaints. These centers evaluate, analyse, and generate fact-based reports for real-time complaint resolution at 
various locations. This enables the customer care team to take prompt actions to address any service shortfalls. Repeat 
complaints trigger a thorough inquiry to address problems and evaluate processes. 
Our sales representatives directly interact with the customers to understand the concerns and complaints of the 
customers and to resolve them through the service teams. Each product packaging consists of warranty terms & 
conditions, instruction to dealers, contact number and email id to get immediate assistance.
