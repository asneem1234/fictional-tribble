Remarks:The Bank has refined its approach to calculating water consumption due to the unavailability of data from all branches. 
In FY 2022-23, water consumption was estimated using purchase records along with state-level data sources and recognized 
standards. For FY 2023-24, water consumption figures have been estimated based on employee numbers. The Bank maintains 
precise consumption data for the Head Office; by applying the employee count and water usage figures from this location, we have 
calculated the water consumption for the entire organization.  Moving forward, we plan to adopt a cost-based calculation method for 
accurate and consistent data.
Remarks: As of now, the company is not tracking water discharge data, but we have planned to implement tracking in the coming years.
