1
Climate 
Change
Opportunity
The 
Company’s 
Carbon 
reduction roadmap will offer 
distinct operational benefits.
By integrating clean energy 
sources into existing power 
networks, the Company is now 
supplying approximately 2.3-
3% of its energy requirements 
from renewable sources.
-
Initiatives addressing climate 
change will have some capex 
requirements, 
but 
it 
will 
financially be rewarding.
2
Emissions
Risk &  
Opportunity
Manufacturing 
emissions 
harm the environment. To 
align with the Government of 
India’s Zero Carbon initiative, 
transitioning to green and 
clean energy solutions is 
essential.
In 
the 
coming 
years, the Company 
intends to implement 
a range of emission 
reduction measures, 
energy conservation 
initiatives, 
and 
energy-efficient 
processes 
across 
all its manufacturing 
facilities to reduce 
emissions.
Though investments in energy 
management 
systems 
and 
technology will have a financial 
impact, 
they 
will 
positively 
impact 
the 
Company’s 
operations 
through 
energy 
conservation initiatives, yielding 
direct financial benefits.
3
Water
management
Risk &
Opportunity
Water, as a limited resource, 
will pose a risk to our 
Company’s operations.
The 
Company 
aims 
to 
tackle 
the 
challenge 
of 
water 
scarcity 
by 
reducing raw water 
consumption 
in 
manufacturing and 
focusing on efficient 
water management. 
This 
proactive 
approach 
ensures 
the issue remains 
manageable 
and 
sustainable for the 
long term.
The 
Company 
has 
made 
substantial investment in waste 
water 
treatment 
for 
water 
conservation and maintaining 
Zero Liquid Discharge status 
in some of the plants. Similar 
investment will be made in 
future to sustain it or if possible, 
to further reduce it.

Diversity
and equal

Opportunity
The ability of the Company to 
ensure that its culture, hiring, 
and promotion policies foster 
the development of a diverse 
and 
inclusive 
workforce, 
makes it’s an opportunity for 
the Company.
-
Strategizing 
improved 
hiring 
techniques and systems may 
incur 
some 
minor 
financial 
implications 
no 
financial 
implications in this
5
Responsible
supply chain
Opportunity
Building a robust supply chain 
has aided us in maintaining 
business continuity in various 
situations. Additionally, our 
strong supply chain has made 
sure that we can maintain 
competitive pricing, together 
with benefiting our customers 
alongside.
-
There may be some financial 
impacts 
while 
further 
strengthening 
supply 
chain 
management.
6
Community 
engagement
Opportunity
Alongside 
the 
Company’s 
interests, 
aligning 
with 
community interests is crucial. 
Building a friendly relationship 
with 
local 
communities 
can 
enhance 
business 
perception and brand image 
positively. 
The 
Company 
actively engages in Corporate 
Social Responsibility (CSR) 
initiatives across all its plants 
to foster stronger community 
ties.
-
These 
continued 
initiatives 
would 
have 
some 
financial 
implications; however, would 
also contribute to the Company’s 
brand image and the creation of 
value for its stakeholders.
7
Manufacturing 
efficiency
Opportunity
Efficient 
manufacturing 
procedures 
enable 
timely 
manufacture 
and 
delivery 
of products to our valued 
clients while also maintaining 
the 
sustainability 
of 
our 
operations. 
Investment 
in 
the 
new 
technology 
and 
processes 
to 
ensure 
the 
quality 
of 
the 
products 
manufactured.

This will have a positive impact 
on the business.

The Company prioritizes stakeholder consultation as integral to our corporate governance and sustainability initiatives. The 
approach involves proactive engagement with a diverse array of stakeholders. Stakeholder consultations are led by relevant 
executives, business leaders, and key process heads of the Company. The Company’s decision-making processes are guided by 
stakeholder’s opinion and view. Based on the thorough input from all stakeholder’s involved, the company regularly reviews different 
developments. This guarantees that, in all pertinent fields, our strategic orientation is in line with our stakeholders’ requirements 
and expectations.
2.

topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these topics 
were incorporated into policies and activities of the entity.
	
Yes, stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental and social topics. The 
incorporation of stakeholder feedback into the process and policy formulation is highly valued by the Company. When necessary, 
stakeholder input is used to help identify and manage social and environmental issues. With this approach, the Company makes 
sure that the decisions taken are well-informed and take into account the various viewpoints and concerns of the people who are 
affected by the Company’s activities.
3.	
Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/ marginalized

has equal opportunity, even though everyone has equal potential from birth, hence efforts are made to identify and assist these 
communities in light of this discrepancy.
