b.	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and 
non-routine basis by the entity
	
	
The hazard identification and risk assessment process is structured into three key stages, involving collaboration between 
ORL 	and its contractors, to ensure workplace safety. An overview of the procedures adhered to has been provided below:
•	
Contractors are tasked with creating a method statement and risk assessment for their activities, which must be reviewed and 
sanctioned by ORL before any work commences.
•	
Contractors conduct an evaluation of the site’s Environment, Health, and Safety (EHS) requirements and submit their EHS Plan 
to ORL for approval, ensuring all operations meet the set safety standards.
•	
It is the contractors’ responsibility to devise a Monthly Inspection Schedule and carry out inspections of the equipment, 
machinery, and workplace to pinpoint potential hazards and implement necessary corrective measures.
•	
ORL staff engage in cross inspections according to a Monthly Activity Plan. Any hazards detected during these inspections are 
reported to the involved contractors via the BIM 360 App for prompt action.
•	
The Central Safety Team undertakes a Monthly EHS Audit at the site, producing a comprehensive report that includes an EHS 
Rating. This report is forwarded to the Projects team to action any needed corrections.
•	
Civil Contractors conduct third-party safety audits independently and follow up with the required corrective measures to address 
any identified risks.
•	
Mandatory Third-Party Inspections (TPI) of all material lifting cranes, tools, tackles, pressure vessels, and passenger hoists are 
carried out biannually, with any necessary corrective actions being executed promptly.
•	
At Oberoi Mall, safety is a paramount concern. Hazards associated with both routine and non-routine tasks are identified and 
evaluated, with effective control measures applied to mitigate risks. Job safety instructions and Standard Operating Procedures 
(SOPs) are carefully drafted and displayed in relevant areas to maintain a safe environment.
•	
Westin MGC adopts a proactive approach to safety, with Daily Rounds to offer continuous updates and feedback. Job Safety 
Analysis (JSA) Trainings are conducted to raise safety awareness and reduce risk exposure. New Joiner Orientations are 
provided to ensure that all new employees are well-integrated into our safety-conscious culture.
	
c.	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove 
themselves from such risks. (Y/N)
	
	
In our dedication to fostering a safe and secure workplace, we ensure that all employees receive thorough safety induction 
training. This encompasses daily toolbox discussions and specific job safety training sessions. Such training is designed to 
equip our workers with the necessary knowledge and skills to identify potential hazards in their tasks and take immediate

To cultivate the right environment and emphasize employee well-being, we have introduced a robust Employee Assistance 
Program (EAP) in collaboration with MediBuddy. This program provides our employees and their family members with access 
to 24/7 tele-counselling and confidential support throughout the year. We also offer face-to-face counselling sessions as 
necessary and conduct special online sessions aimed at promoting mental wellness, raising awareness, and increasing 
sensitivity among our workforce.

Our organization places a high priority on the safety and well-being of our staff and workers. To this end, we have rolled out 
various comprehensive strategies to create and maintain a secure working environment:
•	 We conduct regular Environment, Health, and Safety (EHS) Audits to spot potential hazards and ensure a safe workplace.
•	 We offer periodic safety training sessions, including EHS Induction, Daily Toolbox Talks (TBT), staff training, and emergency 
mock drills, to keep our team informed and ready to handle emergencies.

aluminum formwork shuttering, Rope Suspended Platforms (RSP) for height access, and mobile platforms for working at heights, 
minimizes the need for manual labor and reduces safety risks. We also employ insulated power tools and incorporate earth 
fault and overload protection devices in our electric supply system to prevent electrocution and circuit-related hazards, creating 
a safer work environment.
•	 We ensure the periodic removal of construction waste to keep the work area clean and reduce accidents.
•	 Washrooms and drinking water tanks are cleaned regularly to maintain hygiene in the workplace.
•	 We organize regular medical check-ups for our staff and workers upon entry and arrange periodic health camps to promote 
health awareness and ensure the well-being of our team.
•	 We provide appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), such as safety harnesses for work at heights, ensuring that our 
employees are adequately protected.
•	 The use of scaffolding and mobile platforms for elevated work guarantees the safety of our staff and workers when working 
at heights.
•	 Our electric supply panels are outfitted with Miniature Circuit Breaker (MCB) and Residual Current Circuit Breaker (RCCB) 
protections, securing our electrical systems against potential risks.

Leadership Indicators
1.	
Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, 
and social topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to 
the Board. 
	
The above table outlines the strategies, methods, and goals behind the Company’s stakeholder engagement initiatives. The Company 
firmly believes that active and ongoing engagement with our key stakeholders allows ORL to communicate its strategies and 
achievements more effectively. Continuous interaction facilitates the alignment of expectations, enabling ORL to meet the needs of its 
stakeholders more efficiently. Feedback and insights obtained from these stakeholder engagements are consistently relayed to the ESG 
(Environmental, Social, and Governance) Board Committee, ensuring that stakeholder perspectives are integrated into the Company’s 
decision-making processes
2.	
Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of 
environmental, and social topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs 
received from stakeholders on these topics were incorporated into policies and activities of the entity
	
In the FY 2023-24, our company conducted a double materiality assessment, based on our prior assessment conducted to pinpoint and 
prioritize issues of utmost relevance. This assessment began with an analysis of pertinent ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) 
topics within the Real Estate Industry. By examining the broader business landscape and identifying trends specific to our sector and 
operational locations, we finalized thirty-one topics for further evaluation.
	
These topics were then presented to both our internal and external stakeholders via a survey, seeking their input on the importance of 
these ESG aspects in relation to our global business operations. The range of stakeholders consulted included a representative group of 
our employees, suppliers, contractors, customers, media, and other partners. The feedback received was thoroughly analyzed by our 
Senior Management, and the ESG topics were evaluated based on their potential impact on our business and strategic direction in the 
short to medium term. Consequently, ten topics emerged as significant to both our stakeholders and the business and have since been 
incorporated into our overall strategic planning process.
	
In line with the principles of a double materiality assessment, in FY 2023-24, we have further assessed the inward and outward impact 
of our identified material issues
3.	
Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of 
vulnerable/ marginalized stakeholder groups.  
	
Nurturing and sustaining positive connections with communities significantly enhances our social license to operate and increases 
our brand’s value. Our engagement with marginalized or vulnerable communities is directed by the Company’s Corporate Social 
Responsibility (CSR) policy. Rooted in a commitment to empower the communities surrounding our operations and contribute to creating 
a better future for everyone, our CSR philosophy is action-oriented and impactful.

ment, we did not perform assurance procedures on the remaining information included in the

bility information in accordance with the Reporting Criteria. This responsibility includes in par-
ticular the selection and use of appropriate methods for sustainability reporting, the collection 
and compilation of information and the making of appropriate assumptions or, where appropri-
ate, the making of appropriate estimates. Furthermore, the legal representatives are responsi-
ble for necessary internal controls to enable the preparation of a sustainability report that is 
free of material - intentional or unintentional - erroneous information. 
Verification methodology and procedures performed 
The verification engagement has been planned and performed in accordance with the verifi-
cation methodology developed by the TÜV SÜD Group which is based upon the ISO 17029 
and ISAE 3000.  
The applied level of assurance was “Reasonable Assurance”, the level of assurance ob-
tained in this assurance is higher than limited assurance. The procedures the verification 
team performs in a reasonable assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and 
are more in extent than for a limited assurance engagement.  
The verification was based on a systematic and evidence-based assurance process as 
stated above. The selection of assurance procedures is subject to the auditor’s own judg-
ment. 
The procedures included amongst others: 
- 
Inquiries of personnel who are responsible for the stakeholder engagement und materi-
ality analysis to understand the reporting boundaries 
- 
Evaluation of the design and implementation of the systems and processes for compil-
ing, analysing, and aggregating sustainability information as well as for internal controls
