5.	
Specific commitments, goals and 
targets set by the entity with 
defined timelines, if any.
DBSIL is executing the strategy of becoming water positive and improve soil carbon 
content. Currently, half of the land in the Company’s catchment area has low organic 
carbon content (< 0.5%). The Company aims to increase and maintain the soil organic 
carbon in medium range (0.5% - 0.75%) by 2030. The Company aims to increase the 
soil carbon content through recommended doses in organic manures / compost 
and intervention through animal husbandry programme for domestic animals. The 
Company plans to use green manure crops, undertake crop rotation, and eliminate the 
burning of crop residue.
The water table in the Company’s catchment area in Uttar Pradesh has depleted by 
2 metres in ten years. To address this concern, the Company aims to become 10x 
water positive by 2030. The Company will work with 200,000 sugarcane cultivators in 
reducing their annual ground water consumption by 500 KL per hectare by 2030, with 
annual conservation potential of 25 billion litres.
Soil carbon content and water are the two most critical elements for sustainable 
sugarcane cultivation. By addressing both critical elements, DBSIL is also ensuring 
sustainable livelihoods and income for farmers.
6.	
Performance of the entity against 
the specific commitments, goals 
and targets along-with reasons in 
case the same are not met.
In FY 2023-24, with concentrated effort put up by Company, we have been able to 
achieve carbon content in soil from <0.55% to >0.56%.
With the saving in water consumption and recharge effort with pond/defunct borewell/
recharge structure in water bodies, we nearly achieved target of 2.5X water positive 
with in second year.

7.	
Statement by director responsible 
for the business responsibility 
report, 
highlighting 
ESG 
related challenges, targets and

The Company’s core objective is to ensure the sustainable production of sugar, 
fostering value for both farmers, local communities, and the broader business network. 
Sustainability is at the forefront of the Company’s ethos, marked by initiatives spanning 
water conservation, energy efficiency, resource optimization, waste reduction, and a 
focus on social and corporate responsibility.
In line with its commitment to sustainability, DBSIL is actively promoting a circular 
economy model, often referred to as the non-financial balance sheet. This entails a 
continual exploration of innovative technologies with reduced carbon footprints and 
greenhouse gas emissions.
This year, DBSIL has embraced MVR technology within its distillery operations, 
an advancement aimed at securing sustainable resources for the future. The 
implementation of this technology has resulted in a noteworthy 50% reduction in 
energy requirements compared to traditional methods.
With sustainability as a guiding principle, the Company has identified 34 key areas 
of focus categorized under pillars such as responsible consumption, ethical growth, 
sustainable agricultural practices, and community empowerment.
In response to the evolving landscape of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) 
considerations, the Company is actively crafting an ESG policy centered on sustainable 
sugarcane production. This policy seeks to enrich the lives of farmers and communities 
while safeguarding the ecosystem. Additionally, plans are underway to establish a 
comprehensive monitoring framework to track performance across all ESG dimensions.

LEADERSHIP INDICATORS
1.	 Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, 
and social topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the 
Board.
In this rapidly changing environment, the Company is adapting and responding to issues that matter the most to business and 
stakeholders. It is constantly working on understanding these issues as they help us define strategic priorities and report issues of 
interest to stakeholders. To identify and subsequently validate the material issues, the Company first creates a bucket list of potential 
material aspects by analysing the material issues of peer companies through the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) 
and Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). Furthermore, the Company engages with stakeholder groups to understand views and 
concerns on identified material issues. This helps the Company in defining these material aspects and fabricating a path for long-

2.	 Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, 
and social topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders 
on these topics were incorporated into policies and activities of the entity.
Yes, the stakeholder consultation is important to identify the areas of concern in environment and social sectors. The Company’s 
major stakeholder is the farmers/suppliers/community around us. The main concern is soil health and water conservation, being 
an agrarian community. Hence, the Company is working extensively on soil health management and efficient water usage with 
water conservation, while promoting better agricultural practices for superior yield through the cane department and corporate 
social responsibility initiative. The Company considers unemployment as a concern and operates skill training centres that provide 
placement-linked, short-term skill training programs to the youth.
3.	 Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/ 
marginalized stakeholder groups.
The Company undertakes cane development activities and provides necessary guidance to marginalized cane growers with regards 
to the selection of the right variety of propagation materials, agri-inputs and agronomical practices, support in setting-up farmyard 
manure units, vermicomposting units, provide solar operated sprayers, among others. The promotion of energy-efficient cooking 
methods and the installation of solar lighting has particularly benefited the women and children of the communities. Women 
Self Help Groups are promoted and skills development training sessions (stitching and weaving, Moonj craft, among others) are 
conducted to create additional avenues of income generation for them. Also maternal, neonatal and adolescent health camps 
are run periodically. Many school intervention programmes have been implemented and remedial education centres have been 
established for children. The construction of individual sanitary latrines in line with ‘Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan’ and ‘Swachh Vidyalaya 
Abhiyaan’ benefitted the local community. Skill training centers (ITI and DIKSHa) are being run to ensure skill development, 
enhancing the employability of the local youth.

consumption. We used treated water for green belt development within our plants, supplied to farmers and reused the condensate 
water in the process, cooling applications and green belt development. The Company recognises the importance of watershed and 
water harvesting practices and saved significant amounts of water in and around our plants through such initiatives. In Maharashtra 
and Uttar Pradesh, the Company implemented various water conservation initiatives and constructed several village ponds near 
our plants to increase the availability of fresh water for the local community. The Company sustained near-zero water consumption 
in sugar cane processing with improvements to use recycled water.

At Dalmia Bharat Sugar, we are committed to sustainable practices that mitigate our environmental impact. In line with this

Implementation of MVR Technology: In our ongoing efforts to optimize energy consumption, we have successfully integrated 
Mechanical Vapor Recompression (MVR) technology within our processes. This innovative technology has enabled us to significantly 
lower steam consumption, consequently reducing our overall energy demand. By implementing MVR technology, we have not 
only enhanced our operational efficiency but also achieved a tangible reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.
Enhanced Pollution Control Measures: Recognizing the importance of stringent pollution control, we have undertaken extensive 
modifications to our existing pollution control devices. Additionally, we have proactively installed state-of-the-art pollution control 
equipment at one of our plants. These measures have been instrumental in ensuring compliance with environmental regulations 
while simultaneously minimizing our environmental footprint.

Falling Film Evaporators: The integration of falling film evaporators represents a significant advancement in our operational 
efficiency. By leveraging this technology, we have achieved a substantial reduction in steam demand, leading to lower bagasse 
consumption. This streamlined approach not only enhances our resource utilization but also contributes to a tangible reduction in 
greenhouse gas emissions.
Juice Heaters with Bleeding Arrangements: Our adoption of juice heaters with bleeding arrangements further underscores 
our proactive approach to sustainability. This innovative configuration optimizes heat transfer efficiency, resulting in a reduced 
requirement for steam. As a result, we minimize our reliance on fossil fuels while simultaneously lowering our carbon emissions.
Expansion of Green Initiatives: In the fiscal year (FY), we have significantly expanded our green initiatives by intensifying our 
efforts in afforestation. Recognizing the critical role of trees in carbon sequestration, we have substantially increased the number of 
trees planted across our operational areas. This concerted effort directly contributes to the absorption of carbon dioxide (CO2) from 
the atmosphere, thereby mitigating our carbon footprint.
These initiatives underscore our steadfast commitment to environmental stewardship and align with our broader sustainability 
objectives. Moving forward, we remain dedicated to exploring innovative solutions that foster environmental sustainability and 
contribute to a greener future.
