(Indicate positive 
or negative 
implications)
1. GHG 
Emissions
Risk
Greenhouse 
gas 
(GHG) 
emissions pose several risks 
for a dairy company which 
contributes to a significant 
amount of global emissions. 
As climate change intensifies, 
shifting 
weather 
patterns 
compromise the availability 
and 
quality 
of 
essential 
resources like water and feed 
crops for dairy cattle. Rising 
temperatures also exacerbate 
heat 
stress 
in 
cattle, 
undermining their health and 
productivity.
To mitigate GHG emissions 
risks, PMFL is enhancing 
feed efficiency, decreasing 
manure emissions, using 
45% of clean Renewable 
Energy in its Operations, 
implementing conservation 
measures, optimizing water 
usage, 
and 
addressing 
public concerns regarding 
the ecological footprint of 
the Company.

2. Water 
Management
Risk 
Effective water management is 
crucial in the dairy industry for 
maintaining hygiene, product 
quality and sustainability. Poor 
water quality can harm the 
taste, texture, and shelf-life 
of dairy products, impacting 
brand 
reputation. 
Water 
scarcity 
challenges 
animal 
welfare and farm profitability, 
as dairy farming relies heavily 
on 
water. 
Unsustainable 
water usage and wastewater 
disposal can lead to pollution 
and ecosystem degradation.
To 
address 
water 
management 
risks, 
PMFL 
has implemented various 
strategies, including water 
conservation 
practices, 
monitoring 
water 
usage, 
and implementing water 
management plans. As a 
result, it has significantly 
reduced water consumption 
per litre of milk handled. 
Approximately 
55% 
of 
the unit's water usage is 
sourced 
from 
recycled 
sources, 
demonstrating 
commitment to responsible 
water 
management 
and 
environmental 
preservation. 
This 
achievement is driven by 
recycling and reusing ETP-
treated water for gardening, 
agriculture, and cleaning 
milk 
storage 
tankers, 
adoption of the Zero Liquid 
Discharge principle.
Negative
3. Waste 
Management
Risk
Improper 
disposal 
of 
dairy 
waste 
can 
result 
in 
environmental 
pollution, 
contaminating water sources 
and harming local ecosystems. 
Health 
hazards 
emerge 
as 
manure 
accumulation 
becomes 
a 
ground 
for 
pathogens, 
posing 
threats 
to both livestock and nearby 
communities.
Our 
Company 
mitigates 
the risks associated with 
waste 
management 
by 
implementing the following 
strategies: Reducing waste 
generation, 
Segregating 
and 
managing 
waste, 
implementing 
waste 
management 
plans, 
conducting Training and 
awareness.
Negative
4.
Product 
Quality & 
Safety
Opportunity
PMFL differentiates themselves 
from 
competitors 
and 
establish 
a 
competitive 
advantage. 
Consumers 
are willing to pay more for 
products that are perceived to 
be of higher quality and safe. 
Prioritizing product quality and 
safety encourages innovation 
and differentiation within the 
industry.

2030. In waste management, we have made considerable progress, setting 
ambitious targets to reduce waste generation by 8%, improve packaging 
material consumption by 2% by Year 2026, and reach a 5% improvement per 
metric ton by Year 2030. We are also committed to using 100% recyclable 
packaging material by Year 2030.
Our water management efforts have been equally impressive. We are focused 
on reducing water use per litre of milk, increasing water recycling by 20%, and 
achieving a 35% reduction in fresh water usage by Year 2026. Additionally, we 
are dedicated to recharging 150,000 litres of groundwater Annually through 
initiatives such as rainwater harvesting and pond desilting.
Beyond these environmental initiatives, we have strengthened our 
engagement with suppliers to ensure ethical sourcing practices and 
invested in local communities through various programs. Our commitment 
to ESG performance remains steadfast as we set new targets and refine our 
strategies, continuously striving to drive further progress and uphold our 
dedication to sustainability.

Processes in place to reclaim products for reuse, recycle and safe disposal of products at the end of life:
Describe the processes in place to safely 
reclaim 
your 
products 
for 
reusing, 
recycling and disposing at the end of life, 
for (a) Plastics (including packaging) 
(b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) 
other waste.
As a dairy-based company, our products are perishable and thus 
not intended for recycling. However, we take significant steps to 
manage our environmental impact through effective recycling 
practices within our production process. Specifically, we recycle 
effluent water used for washing milk storage tankers and crates, 
and repurpose it for gardening and other uses.
(a)	 Plastics (Including Packaging):
We work with certified waste handlers to manage our plastic 
waste. This waste is processed through Extended Producer 
Responsibility (EPR) programs, while hazardous plastic waste 
is disposed of by certified vendors. Other types of waste, such 
as food waste, are converted into manure.
(b)	 E-Waste:
As part of our commitment to environmental responsibility, we 
dispose of electronic waste through authorized IT dismantling, 
refurbishing, and servicing facilities once they reach the end of 
their useful life. We obtain disposal and recycling certificates 
from these e-waste vendors to ensure proper management.
(c)	 Hazardous Waste:
Batteries are returned to authorized vendors under a buyback 
policy with original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) when 
they reach the end of their life cycle. Used oil is handed over 
to government-authorized registered recyclers for proper 
disposal.
(d)	 Other Waste:
For general waste management, we partner with certified 
waste handlers. We ensure that we receive disposal and 
recycling certificates from these vendors to verify proper 
waste processing.
Our Company adheres to the principles of ‘Reduce,’ ‘Recycle,’ 
and ‘Recover’ to promote environmental sustainability and 
minimize our ecological footprint.

Extended 
Producer

the

plan 
is in line with the Extended Producer 
Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to 
Pollution Control Boards? If not, provide 
steps taken to address the same.
Yes
Our Company is dedicated to circular waste management 
practices. In June, 2022, we obtained a Brand Owner registration 
certificate from the Central Pollution Control Board, with Registration 
Number: BO-15-000-06-AABCP0425G-22. Our waste collection 
strategy aligns with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) 
plan that we submitted to the Pollution Control Boards.

Our Company has adopted the Occupational Health 
and Safety Assessment Series (OHSAS) standards to 
ensure the health and well-being of our employees. 
We conduct regular awareness sessions focusing 
on safety-related issues and provide training in 
Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) and 
Total Productive Maintenance to further enhance 
safety and operational efficiency.
In addition to physical health, we are committed to 
the mental well-being of our employees. We offer 
various programs and organize discussions with 
well-being experts and medical practitioners to 
support mental health.
To oversee and manage these efforts, we have 
established a Health and Safety Committee, 
supported by a dedicated Health and Safety 
Manager. This team ensures that our health and 
safety practices are effectively implemented and 
continuously improved.
b)

non-routine basis by the entity?
We systematically identify and assess all work-
related hazards associated with our routine activities 
through Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment 
(HIRA). Based on this assessment, we implement 
appropriate control measures to mitigate risks. Our 
site risk register is regularly reviewed and updated 
to reflect any changes.
In addition, we conduct regular audits either internal 
or performed by external customers to continuously 
identify and evaluate work-related hazards. These 
audits help us address both routine and non-
routine risks effectively, ensuring ongoing safety 
and compliance with established standards.

Our Company is committed to reducing our environmental impact 
and preserving our planet for future generations. That’s why we

eliminating all liquid waste from our operations. Our program 
covers all aspects of our operations and is designed to minimize 
the release of harmful chemicals and other pollutants into the 
environment. We have invested in state-of-the-art treatment and 
discharge systems, and we are constantly seeking new ways to 
improve our processes and reduce our environmental impact. 
During our production process, we recycle effluent water used 
in our production facilities for washing milk storage tankers and 
crates, gardening etc.
We believe that this is a critical component of our commitment to 
sustainability, and we are proud of the progress we have made in 
this area. We will continue to prioritize zero liquid discharge and to 
seek out opportunities to further reduce our environmental impact.
