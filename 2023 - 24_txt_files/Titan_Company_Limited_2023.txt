implications)
1.
Carbon, 
Emissions & 
Energy
Risk
Climate change impact 
is growing day by day. 
Especially given the increasing 
regulations in this area a lack 
of prioritisation can negatively 
impact various ESG factors.
1) Conducting carbon, 
emissions and energy audits 
and identifying areas of 
energy reduction
2) Increased sourcing of 
renewable energy
Negative - Risk
2.
Waste 
Management 
and Circular 
Economy
Risk
Poor waste management 
practices can lead to landfill 
buildup and public health 
issues. Failure to appropriately 
manage waste or to 
implement circular strategies, 
during a period of increasing 
regulation of the same, 
can negatively impact the 
Company’s reputation.
Ensuring different types 
of waste are segregated, 
handled and disposed of 
appropriately and by only 
authorised contractors of the 
State Pollution Control Board. 
Additionally, to develop and 
follow circular economy 
initiatives to reduce and reuse 
the waste created during 
production.
Negative - Risk
3.
Water 
Management
Risk
Water is becoming 
increasingly a scarce resource 
especially in India where the 
seasonal rainfalls are the 
primary source of water. Poor 
water management will lead 
to stress for the operations 
and employee well-being.
Adhering to the existing 
water management 
regulations and establishing 
goals for reducing water. 
Furthermore, continuously 
discovering and implementing 
better ways to measure and 
reduce water usage through 
various technologies and 
behaviour change within the 
workforce.
Negative - Risk
4.
Corporate 
Governance 
(Compliance & 
Ethics)
Opportunity
Strong corporate governance 
can foster a culture of ethics 
and social responsibility, 
potentially improving 
employee well-being and 
working conditions. 
Strong corporate governance 
practices promote 
transparency, accountability 
and risk management within 
the Company and hence 
boost the Brand reputation.
Mitigating risk in corporate 
governance involves 
establishing internal controls, 
utilising risk transfer 
mechanisms like engaging in 
active governance oversight 
through Board involvement. 
Additionally, being prepared 
to accurately complete and 
submit relevant compliance 
frameworks in a timely 
manner.

Opportunity
A focus on customer 
centricity can lead to 
enhanced customer 
satisfaction, fostering strong, 
positive relationships with the 
Company’s patrons.
Additionally,a company that 
prioritises customer centricity 
demonstrates strong 
governance and may increase 
investor confidence due to 
its ability to retain and satisfy 
customers.

with customers through 
various means including 
virtual interactions
2) Loyalty driven programs 
and promotion of products 
and services
3) Enhanced customer 
experience at retail stores
4) Leveraging of social

Positive - Opportunity
6.

materials can support local 
economies and enhance the 
Company’s image among 
consumers.
By using sustainable and/
or recycled raw materials, 
the Company can conserve 
natural resources and reduce 
environmental impact.
1) Setting goals to reduce 
the Company’s dependence 
on finite and non-renewable 
raw materials by promoting 
recycling of materials 
wherever possible
2) Adopting policies for 
responsible raw material 
sourcing and sustainable 
procurement, thereby 
ensuring product traceability
Positive - Opportunity
7.
Sustainability 
Practices of 
Suppliers
Opportunity
A well-enforced supplier 
code of conduct is a sign of 
strong corporate governance, 
improving the Company’s 
credibility among investors 
and other stakeholders. 
Furthermore, sustainable 
practices can directly 
contribute to improved 
working and living conditions 
for the supplier communities 
and could result in indirect 
positive environmental 
impacts though reduced 
resource usage.
1) Adopting policies for 
responsible sourcing and 
sustainable procurement 
to enhance the Company’s 
sustainability performance in 
the supply chain
2) Suppliers are required

Governance, leadership and oversight
7.	
Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, 
targets and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
	
The Company is committed to integrating Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) principles into its business 
strategy which is central to improving the quality of life of the stakeholders it serves. The Company has taken 
measures to inculcate beneficial and fair business practices to the labour, human capital and to the community 
at large. It provides employees and workers with working conditions that are clean, healthy and safe. During the 
reporting period, our CSR committee was reconstituted as CSR and Sustainability Committee, which would assist 
in developing ESG centric goals and targets. The Company has been at the forefront of leading initiatives like 
Affirmative Action, Diversity, Inclusion and Equity, Corporate Social Responsibility considering all the stakeholders. 
With ESG gaining centre stage in our business strategy, we have identified the key ESG areas we want to focus 
as part of our business strategy and are in process of establishing goals and targets for these areas. Titan also 
has been transforming the industry, especially in jewellery and more recently in dresswear, which are known for 
their unhygienic and hazardous working conditions. Titan Company has set-up state-of-the-art and worker-friendly 
working facilities and has influenced the vendor partners also to emulate the same, thereby improving the working 
conditions and health & safety of the Karigar community. Titan Company has also invested significantly in renewable 
energy and continues to foster a greener environment for the future. During the reporting period, we had sourced 
1.72 crore units of renewable energy for our manufacturing plants and offices. The Company has also identified 
Water as a key focus area and has taken up projects of scale both within and outside the fence. Waste management 
especially plastics will be a key focus area from this year. On the Governance side, Titan has a very strong and 
versatile Board which has won many accolades in the recent past. It also has a strong programme around ethical 
conduct that has been crafted on the lines of the Tata Code of Conduct (TCOC) and has an independent oversight by 
the Board of Ethics Committee. CSR and Sustainability Committee of the Board is focused on guiding the Company 
with ambitious goals whilst there will be challenges with standardisation across the very diverse, unorganised 
vendor ecosystem and a very wide set of consumers.

12.	 Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy work place. 
	
Our Company is working to ensure “Every person goes home safe and healthy every day” that reflects our vision to ‘Be 
the Safest and Healthiest Organisation in the Eyes of all our Stakeholders’. Our strategy is built on four cornerstones, which 
are leadership, a systematic approach, continually building an active OHS culture and safe workplaces and equipment. We 
have continued to build on our OHS strategy by strengthening our safety leadership capability, fostering a strong safety 
culture, improving the effectiveness of our safety management system, and managing risks associated with workplaces 
and equipment.
	
A.	
Leadership Skills:
	
	
We constantly focus on building safety leadership capability from senior leaders to front-line supervisors. 
	
	
a)	
The safety messages from the senior management team are circulated to all the frontline employees on a 
periodical basis through video messages, e-mail communications and displays at prominent locations.
	
	
b)	
Any meeting concerned with the entity, starts with the safety note. The same is being followed at internal and 
external meetings too.
	
	
c)	
The senior management team is involved in periodical walkthroughs.
	
B.	
Systematic Approach:
	
	
We follow a unique approach towards safety culture. The pattern of our approach is risk centric, where we drive 
the entire system based on anticipation and identification of the risks well in advance, proactively and ensuring the 
effective control measures are put in place. The scope of our safety system covers the end to end of the entity. Below 
are few of our practices.
	
	
a)	
Project Suraksha - Retail stores: To keep our retail stores safe and secure, not only for our employees but also 
for all our customers who walk in. We make sure that safety and health requirements are part of the design. 
We carry out deep dive safety assessments of our stores named “Project Suraksha to make sure that the design 
intent is complied with.
	
	
b)	
Manufacturing Units - Risk Based Approaches: We have identified all our ongoing activities at department level 
across the Integrated Supply Chain Management (ISCMs). The risks are quantified and prioritised; thereof the

Leadership Indicators
1.	
Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and 
social topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.
	
The Company ensures transparent communication and access to relevant information about its decisions that impact 
relevant stakeholders, keeping in mind the need to protect confidential competitive plans and information. Engagement 
with stakeholders is a continuous process which are driven by the senior management, coordinated by the corporate 
sustainability team and site level management representatives. The inputs from stakeholders are provided by the senior 
management to the CSR and Sustainability Committee and Stakeholders Relationship Committee, which is responsible to 
prioritise and place these feedback to the board.
2.	
Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, 
and social topics (Yes/No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders 
on these topics were incorporated into policies and activities of the entity.
	
Yes. We have a structured methodology for stakeholder consultation. It is done by involving multiple approaches such as
	
1.	
Internally each dept reviews the environment aspect and impact of the activities carried out. Significant negative 
impact is identified and actions are taken.
	
2.	
The management identifies significant environment issues and address them through Sustainability Mission programs.
	
3.	
We have a framework to capture the interested party concern. The public or any interested parties can record their 
concern through the complaint register provided at the main entrance office. Any such complaints received will be 
reviewed by the Environmental Engineer and action taken to address the concern.

The action plans for mitigation are monitored and reviewed by the HODs and presented to the factory Head annually.
	
In case of society/community the inputs are translated into a series of CSR programs that are then implemented in the 
community with a clear understanding and definition of likely impact it will create, through the help of NGO partners we 
work with. 
3.	
Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/ 
marginalised stakeholder groups. 
	
a)	
The Company has a well-defined engagement with vulnerable or marginalised stakeholder groups. The women self-help 
groups (MEADOWS) that has been in existence for over three decades and that support our operations is a classic example 
of working with underprivileged women. The Karigar Centre/Park for jewellery and Weavershala for the saree vendors are 
also examples of well-established approaches to support the vulnerable and under supported/served sectors.
	
b)	
We have embedded inclusion as an important part of our CSR policy. All our programs are directed towards 
marginalised community be it people from Affirmative Action (AA), underprivileged girl child for education or the 
underprivileged youth where we impart skilling. This apart, we have also embedded PWDs as part of the CSR/AA 
engagements across the country.
	
	
These are well-defined programs and can be classified as one of best-in-class policy of inclusion.
