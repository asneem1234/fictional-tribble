Yes. Health and safety are of paramount importance in the real estate industry. At Puravankara, we ensure that our employees 
and workers have access to a safe and healthy workplace. Our projects are executed as turnkey through well-established 
contractors. All our turnkey contractors adhere to high quality standards and most of them are certified for EMS and OHS 
standards. The contractors follow all statutory frameworks such as provisions of remittance, payments and filing of returns

diligence and audits in these areas. 
b. What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by the 
entity? 
The HIRA (Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment) register is a crucial component of health and safety systems. It involves 
conducting risk analysis by evaluating potential harm or negative effects of identified hazards after they are discovered during 
specific activities. If the risk level is classified as "high" or "medium" based on the risk matrix, effective and feasible risk controls 
are implemented to reduce the risk to an "As low as reasonably practicable (ALARP) " level. In the event of an incident, a root 
cause analysis is conducted and a suitable hierarchy of controls is adopted based on the findings.
c. Whether you have processes for workers to report the work related hazards and to remove themselves from such risks. 
(Y/N) 
Yes. The company engages workers through consultations, joint discussions and committee meetings encouraging feedback 
via various communication modes. Each site has a formal Joint Management-worker Health and Safety Committee with 
representatives from different departments and employees such as Project PIC, Secretary-Project Heads, led by the Chairperson, 
who is the decision-making authority. 
d. Do the employees/ worker of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services? (Yes/ No) 
Yes, the Organization prioritizes the promotion of workers' health by providing easy access to non-occupational medical 
services through ID cards and insurance cards. Quarterly health check-up and health camps are conducted to address various 
health issues, including TB, HIV/AIDS, mental health and substance abuse. OHS-related statistics are shared during Board 
meetings for refining OHS strategy.

LEADERSHIP INDICATORS 
1. With respect to the ecologically sensitive areas reported at Question 10 of Essential Indicators above, provide details 
of significant direct & indirect impact of the entity on biodiversity in such areas along-with prevention and remediation 
activities. 
We, at Puravankara, carefully select project sites that are not adjacent to protected areas of high biodiversity value, and many of 
our sites are on unvegetated land or brownfields, allowing us to enhance biodiversity. Following "The You" philosophy, we create 
green, airy spaces throughout our properties to ensure our customers' well-being,with initiatives such as Miyawaki forest, paw 
park and Koi pond promoting biodiversity. 
Before commencing any project , we conduct a detailed Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) as a prerequisite to ensure our 
activities and operations do not significantly impact biodiversity, in accordance with regulatory requirements. Some initiatives 
to enhance biodiversity on our properties include:
•	
Utilising the natural site gradient for basements and landscaping , minimizing earth cutting and filling. 
•	
Maximizing green cover and adding diverse vegetation to reduce the heat island effect and enhance the microclimate. 
Designing green spaces with different vegetation layers, from undergrowth of herbaceous plants to a canopy, creating 
continuous green cover. 
•	
Transforming planting spaces into pollinator gardens with perennials and shrubs for habitat diversity 
•	
Using local species of hardy shrubs with low water requirements , beneficial for soil stabilization. 
•	
Creating gardens on balconies to further promote biodiversity and green spaces. Eco-Conscious Plant Care and wildlife 
preservation  
•	
Regularly watering plants to keep them clean and healthy. 
•	
Providing food and water to birds on the premises, especially during summers.
•	
Properly disposing of food waste by sending it to pig farms. 
•	
Establishing a vegetable garden on-site
•	
Safeguarding honeycombs and safely removing them using appropriate methods. 
•	
Catching and safely relocating snakes to the forest.

3. Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan? 
Certainly, here are some additional considerations for a real estate company's business continuity and disaster management 
plan:
1. 	 Emergency Response Teams: Establish dedicated emergency response teams at each project site and office location to 
coordinate actions during crises and ensure the safety of personnel and assets.
2. 	 Communication Protocols: Implement clear communication protocols to disseminate timely information and instructions 
to employees, clients, tenants, and other stakeholders during emergencies.
3. 	 Insurance Coverage: Maintain comprehensive insurance coverage tailored to address various types of risks, including 
property damage, business interruption, liability, and cyber threats.
4. 	 Regular Risk Assessments: Conduct periodic risk assessments to identify potential hazards and vulnerabilities, allowing 
for proactive measures to mitigate risks and enhance resilience.
5. 	 Supplier and Contractor Relationships: Foster strong relationships with key suppliers, contractors, and service providers to 
facilitate swift responses and resource mobilization during emergencies.
6. 	 Technology Integration: Leverage technology solutions such as remote monitoring systems, digital communication 
platforms, and data analytics to enhance situational awareness and decision-making capabilities during emergencies.
7. 	 Business Continuity Training: Provide ongoing training and drills for employees to ensure they are familiar with emergency 
procedures, evacuation protocols, and crisis management strategies.
8. 	 Regulatory Compliance: Stay abreast of relevant regulations and compliance requirements related to safety, environmental 
protection, and emergency preparedness to avoid penalties and legal liabilities.
9. 	 Continuous Improvement: Establish a culture of continuous improvement by conducting post-incident reviews, gathering 
feedback from stakeholders, and implementing lessons learned to enhance the effectiveness of the business continuity and 
disaster management plan over time.
4. Disclose any significant adverse impact to the environment, arising from the value chain of the entity. What mitigation or 
adaptation measures have been taken by the entity in this regard. 
Emissions at our headquarters have increased in the fiscal year 2022-23 compared to 2021-22. This rise can be attributed to 
the normalization of work routines post-pandemic, reflecting our return to operational capacity. In the case of our projects, the 
total emissions for 2022-23 have gone up relative to 2021-22, attributed to higher energy consumption, because of number and 
phase of projects, which is energy intensive. There is a marginal decrease in DG usage owing to intermittency of grid supply. 
This nuanced analysis provides valuable insights into the factors influencing emissions dynamics in our project locations, 
emphasizing the impact of external factors such as power disruptions on the emission composition. This detailed breakdown 
enhances the clarity of our emissions data and facilitates a more strategic approach to emission reduction initiatives, 
considering both internal operational changes and external factors affecting energy sources. We have taken steps to reduce 
emissions by using renewable energy sources such as solar PV rooftop for common area lighting, BIS-certified star rated 
equipment for HVAC, clubhouse equipment and common area lighting.
5. Percentage of value chain partners (by value of business done with such partners) that were assessed for environmental 
impacts. 
100% of the value chain partners of our business were assessed for environmental impacts.
