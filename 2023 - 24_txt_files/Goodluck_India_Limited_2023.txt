Risk 
Significant amount of carbon dioxide 
and methane are released into the 
atmosphere during the manufacturing 
of iron and steel, as well as during on-
site fuel burning. The amount of 
greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) per 
ton of steel produced has decreased 
due to technical advancements in the 
steel industry. Because of climate

2. 
Air risk quality  
Risk  
The basis behind designating air quality 
as a concern is its substantial influence 
on health and operational factors. 
Serious health problems brought on by 
poor air quality can affect both the 
community and the workforce. This may 
have an impact on corporate operations 
through 
increased 
healthcare 
expenditures, decreased productivity, 
and possible legal issues. 
 
To manage the risk of air quality, our 
approach 
emphasizes 
proactive 
strategies. The Company seeks to 
lower emissions by adopting advanced 
technologies 
and 
optimizing 
processes, monitoring air quality in 
real-time, 
collaborating 
with 
communities and experts, transitioning 
to 
renewable 
energy 
sources, 
investing 
in 
green 
infrastructure, 
ensuring 
regulatory 
compliance, 
educating employees, and continuously 
improving our methods. This holistic 
approach underscores our dedication 
to mitigating air quality risks and 
fostering 
a 
cleaner, 
healthier 
environment.

Recognizing the management of waste

imperative to recognize it as a risk.

Company's commitment to sustainable water use. The company's water treatment 
 
Page 51 of 78 
 
mechanism incorporates a variety of sophisticated processes to ensure effective effluent 
treatment. Initially, incoming effluent is collected in a septic tank where primary settling 
occurs. It is then transferred to an equalization tank to balance out fluctuations in effluent 
quality and quantity. Following this, the effluent undergoes biological treatment in a 
Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR). Here, aeration promotes bacterial growth, which breaks 
down organic matter efficiently. The treated water is then moved to a decanting tank for 
further clarification, allowing any remaining solids to settle out. Subsequently, the clarified 
water passes through a multi-grade filter, which removes suspended particles of varying 
sizes, and an activated carbon filter that eliminates fine particles, colour, odour, and other 
impurities. The final treated water is stored in a treated water tank, ensuring it meets 
required standards for reuse in applications such as gardening and toilet flushing. In a 
parallel treatment stream, effluent is accumulated in a collection tank before being pumped 
to a neutralization tank where lime is added to adjust the pH levels. The neutralized effluent 
is then directed to a filter press, which dewaters the sludge, separating solids from liquids. 
The filtrate is collected in a holding sump, while the sludge is packed in HDPE bags and stored 
in a solid waste area. The treated water from the holding sump is further purified through a 
pressure sand filter, removing finer suspended impurities, and an activated carbon filter to 
eliminate remaining contaminants. Micron filtration is employed to achieve ultra-fine 
filtration, followed by reverse osmosis (RO) for primary desalination, significantly reducing 
dissolved salts. Finally, the concentrated brine from the RO process is treated in a multiple 
effect evaporator, which reduces waste by evaporating water and concentrating the 
remaining brine. This comprehensive, multi-stage process ensures that the company's water 
treatment mechanism is both effective and sustainable, aligning with environmental 
standards and facilitating the reuse of treated water in various non-potable applications

10. Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. 
Describe the strategy adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic 
chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such 
wastes. 
Goodluck India Limited has implemented a comprehensive waste management plan to 
handle all types of waste and recyclable materials generated within its factory premises. 
The plan aims to ensure safe, environmentally responsible collection, storage, and 
disposal of waste. Responsibilities are clearly defined, with administration, stores, and a 
Recyclable Material Committee (REM) managing different aspects of the process. Waste 
is segregated, collected in designated bins, and transferred to appropriate storage areas. 
Specific procedures are in place for the handling of various waste types, including 
chemicals, oils, and general scrap. Disposal involves selling recyclable materials to 
approved vendors who meet strict Environmental Health & Safety (EH&S) requirements. 
The plan includes regular monitoring, record-keeping, and periodic inspections to 
maintain compliance and prevent environmental contamination. This systematic approach 
ensures that all waste management activities are conducted safely and sustainably.

Use of 
renewable 
energy 
The Company has made 
significant strides in its 
initiative to use renewable 
energy, achieving an 
impressive usage of 
9,15,972.92 gigajoules in the 
current year through third-
party sources. This substantial 
shift towards sustainable 
energy not only underscores 
The Company's commitment to 
reducing its carbon footprint 
but also highlights its proactive 
approach in embracing cleaner 
energy alternatives. 
The use of renewable energy has led 
to 
a 
significant 
reduction 
in 
greenhouse gas emissions. This 
substantial adoption of clean energy 
has 
enhanced 
the 
company's 
sustainability profile, showcasing its 
dedication 
to 
environmental 
stewardship.

mitigate the risk of water scarcity, 
especially during dry seasons, and 
promote sustainable water 
management practices. Additionally, 
it will reduce soil erosion and 
improve groundwater recharge, 
contributing to the overall 
environmental sustainability of the 
company. 
3 
Plantation 
of 6000 
Plants with 
Miyawaki 
Method 
The company invested Rs. 
450000 in planting 6000 plants 
using the Miyawaki method. 
This method involves densely 
planting native tree species in a 
small area to create a self-
sustaining forest ecosystem. 
The initiative aims to enhance 
biodiversity, improve air 
quality, and create a green 
space within a short time. 
The Miyawaki plantation will lead to 
rapid forest growth, with the plants 
growing 10 times faster and 
resulting in 30 times denser 
vegetation compared to 
conventional methods. This will 
significantly improve air quality, 
increase carbon sequestration, and 
provide habitat for local wildlife, 
contributing to the overall ecological 
balance. 
 
5. Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan? Give details 
in 100 words/ web link.   
 
The company's disaster management plan outlines detailed procedures and 
responsibilities for handling various emergencies. In case of a fire, initial response 
involves shouting "Fire Fire" to attract attention and attempting to extinguish small fires. 
If the fire is unmanageable, the section in charge must be informed, and the fire alarm 
raised. Carbon Dioxide and ABC fire extinguishers are used for most fires, while foam 
type extinguishers are reserved for liquid fires. If extinguishers are insufficient, the 
hydrant system is used after ensuring all electrical connections are turned off. In the 
HSD oil storage yard, foam monitors are employed. Immediate communication with the 
EHS and Security Departments is crucial. If the fire is uncontrollable, senior officials and 
 
Page 62 of 78 
 
additional personnel from other departments are called, and mutual aid partners such 
as the Fire Brigade may be contacted. Post-fire, the site is preserved for investigation 
and salvage operations commence, ensuring used water and chemical waste do not enter 
outside drains. For flood, heavy rains, and storm emergencies, the Admin and EHS 
Departments ensure all drain points are clear to prevent waterlogging, with dewatering 
pumps tested weekly. Only Gate No. 1 remains operational during a storm, with personnel 
instructed to stay in their workstations. In the event of an earthquake, the emergency 
control room is activated, communication with team members is established, and 
associates are instructed to take cover and protect themselves. Post-earthquake, the 
situation is assessed and premises inspected. During riots, both gates are closed to 
prevent entry of unwanted persons, the local police station is informed, and cooperation
