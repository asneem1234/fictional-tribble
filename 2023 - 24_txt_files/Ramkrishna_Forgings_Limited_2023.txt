Company to proactively 
identify and mitigate 
potential threats, such as 
climate change impacts 
or regulatory changes. By 
addressing risks effectively, 
the Company can safeguard 
its operations, enhance 
resilience, and capitalize on 
emerging opportunities in 
sustainable practices and 
markets. 
1.	
The Company has a Risk Management 
Committee 
comprising 
majorly 
of 
Independent Directors to monitor and 
oversee the risks faced by the Company
2.	
The Company has initiated Enterprise Risk 
Management (ERM) procedure to identify the 
potential risks of the Company
3.	
The Company aims to integrate ESG risks into 
the Company’s ERM Framework. For this, the 
Company plans to conduct a climate risk 
assessment in the FY 2024-25. 
Positive financial implication:
1.	
Proactive risk management can help 
avoid or mitigate potential financial losses 
associated with various risks, such as 
operational disruptions, legal liabilities, or 
reputational damage. By identifying and 
addressing risks early, the Company can 
minimize the financial impact of adverse 
events.
2.	
By identifying and addressing ESG-
related risks, such as climate change 
impacts, resource scarcity, labor issues, 
and governance failures, the Company 
can enhance their resilience to various 
economic, social, and environmental 
shocks. This can reduce the likelihood 
of financial losses due to disruptions in 
operations or supply chains.
3.	
Proactively managing ESG risks can lead 
to cost savings in several areas, such as 
energy and resource efficiency, waste 
reduction, employee health and safety, 
and regulatory compliance.
