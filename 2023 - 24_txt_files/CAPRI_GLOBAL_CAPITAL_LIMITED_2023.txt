Financial implications of

(Indicate positive or negative

1.
Corporate
governance
and
business
ethics
Opportunity 
and Risk
Corporate 
governance 
and 
business 
ethics 
are 
vital 
for 
establishing 
trust 
with 
stakeholders 
and 
boosting 
Capri’s reputation. By focusing 
on transparency, accountability, 
and sustainable practices, Capri 
shows its dedication to these 
principles.
NA
Positive and Negative
Prioritizing 
strong 
corporate 
governance and ethical conduct 
can bring about substantial 
financial benefits. Increased trust 
and a strong reputation attract 
more 
investors, 
potentially 
lowering capital costs.
Failing governance protocols 
risks 
regulatory 
penalties, 
reputational damage, financial 
instability, 
liquidity 
crises, 
and loss of licenses. Strict 
compliance ensures operational 
integrity and long-term success.
2.
Compliance Opportunity
Compliance 
is 
crucial 
for
avoiding legal penalties and 
maintaining 
the 
company’s 
reputation. 
Adhering 
to 
regulatory 
requirements 
enhances trust and credibility 
with 
stakeholders. 
Treating 
compliance as a key priority 
helps 
streamline 
operations 
and fosters a culture of integrity, 
positioning Capri as a reliable 
and responsible player in the 
market.
NA
Positive
Effective compliance reduces 
the risk of costly fines and 
legal issues. It also improves 
operational 
efficiency 
and 
attracts investment by ensuring 
adherence to regulations. This 
proactive 
approach 
builds 
investor confidence, supporting 
long-term financial stability and 
growth.
3
Data 
privacy and 
protection
Opportunity 
and Risk
Data privacy and protection 
are essential for maintaining 
customer trust and complying 
with 
regulations. 
Prioritizing 
this area demonstrates Capri’s 
commitment to safeguarding 
sensitive 
information, 
reducing the risk of breaches 
and 
associated 
reputational 
damage. This proactive stance 
enhances the Capri’s credibility 
and competitive advantage.
To 
ensure 
data 
protection 
& 
privacy, there are 
internal 
policies 
and 
guidelines 
to 
ensure 
the 
collection, use and 
storage of data is 
secure.
Positive and Negative
Investing in data privacy and 
protection mitigates the risk 
of costly data breaches and 
regulatory 
fines. 
It 
fosters 
customer loyalty and attracts 
new clients, driving revenue 
growth. 
Enhanced 
data 
security practices also improve 
operational 
efficiency 
and 
reduce potential financial losses, 
contributing 
to 
long-term 
profitability and stability.
4
IT and cyber 
security
Opportunity 
and Risk
IT and cyber security are critical 
for protecting company assets 
and sensitive information. While 
robust cybersecurity practices 
offer a competitive edge and 
build customer trust, inadequate 
measures can lead to data 
breaches, legal penalties, and 
reputational damage.
To mitigate IT and 
cyber security risks, 
Capri implements 
robust 
security 
protocols, conducts 
regular vulnerability 
a s s e s s m e n t s , 
and 
ensures 
compliance 
with 
industry standards.
Positive and Negative
Effective cyber security can 
enhance financial stability by 
preventing 
costly 
breaches 
and associated fines, boosting 
customer 
confidence, 
and 
ensuring 
business 
continuity. 
Similarly, poor cyber security 
can result in significant financial 
losses, regulatory penalties, and 
loss of customer trust, severely 
impacting the market position.

Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No) –
		Being a financial products and services company, we do not require significant raw materials or manufacture any 
tangible goods. Although, we champion resource conservation and innovative methods to reduce reliance on 
natural resources. Capri Global is committed to sustainability by implementing initiatives to reduce paper usage, 
such as digital document management systems and promoting electronic communication channels. We implement 
recycling programs and encourage employees to adopt sustainable practices. Additionally, Capri Global invests in

energy-efficient technologies and practices, such as LED lighting and motion sensors, to minimise carbon footprint 
and enhance operational efficiency.
		Building on our Phase one efforts in FY 22-23, Phase Two of our Environmental and Social Responsibility program 
focuses on advancing green IT practices, deepening employee engagement, and expanding paperless operations. 
We are implementing advanced virtualization and energy-efficient hardware. To further our commitment, we are 
intensifying paperless operations with enterprise-wide digital document management systems and e-signature 
solutions.
		Inverter Air Conditioners with R32 Refrigerant: As part of our green initiative, we are outfitting all our gold loan 
branches with inverter air conditioners that utilize R32 refrigerant. R32 is recognized globally for its low global 
warming potential (GWP) and high energy efficiency. This step not only adheres to international green standards 
but also supports India’s National Action Plan on Climate Change, which emphasizes reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions.
		Recyclable Gold Pouches Made from LDPE: Our gold pouches are made from low-density polyethylene (LDPE), a 
globally accepted recyclable plastic. This initiative supports our efforts to reduce plastic waste, in line with global 
best practices and India’s Plastic Waste Management Rules, which emphasize recycling and sustainable use of 
plastics.
