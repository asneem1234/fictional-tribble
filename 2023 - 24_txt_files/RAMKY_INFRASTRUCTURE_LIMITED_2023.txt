Water 
manage­
ment
Risk
Water management is a critical aspect 
for infrastructure companies as they 
heavily rely on a stable and adequate 
supply of water for construction and 
ongoing operations. As environmen­
tal concerns grow, investors and 
stakeholders increasing focus on the 
sustainability practices of companies. 
Failing to address water management 
risks can harm Ramky’s reputation and 
attractiveness to investors.
Ramky is committed to miti­
gate the risk which is associ­
ated with water management 
by identifying and assessing 
water risks, developing a 
water risk management plan. 
This will help to ensure that 
the plan is effective and that 
it is supported by all stake­
holders.
 
Negative
3.
Community 
develop­
ment
Risk
Infrastructure projects often require 
significant land acquisition, which can 
lead to displacement and resettlement 
of communities. If not managed prop­
erly, this can result in social unrest, 
protests, and legal challenges.
Ramky proactively engages 
with local communities, at­
tending to their concerns, 
and invests in sustainable and 
responsible practices, thus 
enhancing the likelihood of 
mitigating these risks.
Negative
4.
Workforce 
Health and 
Safety
Risk
The nature of infrastructure projects 
often involves high-risk activities, such 
as construction, excavation, and heavy 
machinery operations. Without proper 
safety measures, there is an increased 
likelihood of accidents, injuries, and, 
in the worst cases, fatalities among 
the workforces.
Ramky is known for its pro­
fessional management team 
and advanced MIS in a SAP 
environment. The company 
prioritizes employee well-
being through rigorous safety 
practices and compliance with 
health and safety regulations.

10.	 Waste management practices adopted in the establishment: 
Briefly describe the waste management practices 
adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy 
adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous 
and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and 
the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
Given that Ramky is solely engaged into Construction services, it does not 
partake in any manufacturing processes. However, the Company upholds 
sustainable waste management practices to ensure proper disposal of 
generated waste.
a) E-waste, Plastic and Battery waste - The Company facilitates the 
transportation of plastic waste to local vendors for processing and 
disposal. Ensuring the proper handling of E-Waste is crucial, both for 
security purposes and environmental considerations. Consequently, 
computers and associated accessories are delivered to vendors or certified 
disposal agencies. To track the quantity of battery waste collected, 
disposed of, and recycled, the Company has implemented a reporting 
and monitoring system.
b) Hazardous Waste - As a Construction Company, our operations do not 
involve the use of hazardous or toxic chemicals, and as a result, we do 
not generate any such waste.
c) Other waste - Given the nature of the Company’s business, other forms 
of waste are not applicable.
