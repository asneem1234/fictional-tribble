1.
GHG emissions 
& Climate 
Change
Risk and 
Opportunity
KEI 
Industries 
operates 
in 
an industry that is severely 
regulated in terms of greenhouse 
gas emissions. Noncompliance 
with 
local 
and 
international 
environmental standards may 
result in significant penalties, 
punishments, 
and 
a 
ruined 
reputation.
-Climate 
change 
can 
cause 
extreme weather events, which 
disrupt the supply chain, reduce 
raw material availability, and 
cause 
manufacturing 
delays. 
This 
is 
especially 
important 
for 
manufacturing 
processes 
that rely on consistent and 
predictable inputs.
- 
Customers 
and 
investors 
are 
increasingly 
valuing 
sustainability. Failure to reduce 
GHG emissions may lead to 
missed economic prospects and 
decreasing investor trust.
- 
This 
also 
presents 
an 
opportunity 
to 
re-evaluate 
current processes and make 
them more efficient to build 
an edge in terms of scalability 
and sustainability of business 
operations as well as product 
offerings
1.	Build Awareness on climate 
change among employees
2.	Build capacity to monitor 
and report performance on 
environment parameters
3.	Engage with subject matter 
expertise 
on 
improving 
efficiencies on performance 
against 
climate 
change 
issues 
4.	Communicate 
to 
relevant 
stakeholders on initiatives 
KEI is adopting to mitigate 
climate change risks 
Positive- 
Proactively 
addressing climate change 
risks will boost KEI Industries’ 
brand recognition, and create 
new business prospects
Negative- Failure to manage 
climate 
change 
risks 
may 
result 
in 
regulatory 
fines, 
greater 
operational 
expenses owing to climate-
related 
interruptions, 
and the loss of business 
from 
environmentally 
conscientious 
clients. 
These variables might have 
a 
detrimental 
influence 
on KEI Industries’ financial 
performance.

Product 
Stewardship
Opportunity
It is imperative to reduce 
a 
product’s 
environmental 
effect 
across 
all 
phases. 
KEI 
strives 
to 
minimise 
any 
adverse 
impact 
on 
environment throughout life 
cycle of its products. 
Through product stewardship 
exercise 
KEI 
aims 
to 
continuously 
monitor 
environment 
footprint 
of 
its product and further aims 
to bring sustainability in its 
product development
-
Positive - Proactive product 
stewardship will help KEI 
identify opportunities to 
bring in efficiencies and 
sustainability in its process 
and ultimately will result in 
maintaining edge over its 
competitors 
3.
Natural 
Resource 
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity
KEI Industries, a cable and 
wire manufacturing company 
strongly reliant on natural 
resources right from supply of 
materials to its own processes 
and operations. Availability of 
natural resource has direct 
impact on the company’s 
operations and thus require 
effective management of its 
natural resources. 
1.	Efficient use of natural 
resources 
to 
minimise 
wastages.
2.	Identifying 
alternate 
sources 
to 
ensure 
business continuity
3.	Use 
of 
renewable 
resources 
in 
its 
own 
production processes
4.	Engaging with suppliers 
on effective and efficient 
use 
of 
resources 
and 
adopting ESG measures in 
their operations 
Positive - Company which 
is able to manage its natural 
resources effectively will 
always have an upper hand in 
terms of cost effectiveness 
and ultimately will drive its 
business growth in a more 
sustainable way. 
Negative 
- 
If 
natural 
resources are not effectively 
managed 
it 
could 
lead 
to increase in cost and 
ultimately adversely impact 
company’s growth.
4.
Supply Chain 
Sustainability
Risk and 
Opportunity
Like many industry peers, 
KEI 
Industries 
relies 
on 
its 
value 
chain 
partners 
in 
various 
stages 
of 
its 
product 
development. 
Environmentally and socially 
responsible 
supply 
chain 
practices 
safeguard 
long-
term viability of the business 
and strengthen its social 
licence to operate. 
1.	Engagement with value 
chain partners on regular 
basis to build awareness 
on ESG issues
2.	Onboarding process of 
value chain partners to 
include ESG due diligence
3.	Evaluation of its value 
chain partners on industry 
best practices on frequent 
basis
Positive - Efficient supply 
chain 
management 
ensures 
reduced 
environmental impact and 
long-term value to the 
company’s sustainability-
led endeavours.
Negative - A mismanaged 
supply 
chain 
leads 
to 
ineffective 
utilization 
of 
resources, 
hampers 
efficient procurement of 
materials and may lead to 
increase business costs 
and reputational damage.
5.
Human 
Capital 
Development
Risk and 
Opportunity
Human capital development 
is critical for KEI Industries, 
since 
it 
directly 
affects 
productivity, creativity, and 
competitiveness. Investing in 
staff skills, training, and well-
being may result in enhanced 
productivity, 
higher-quality 
goods, and more customer 
happiness. Furthermore, a 
strong human capital basis 
may attract top personnel, 
lower turnover, and build a 
favourable company culture.
1.	Implementing 
continual 
training programs to help 
personnel improve their 
skills.
2.	Creating 
career 
development programs to 
retain talent.
3.	Promoting a good work-
life 
balance 
to 
boost 
employee morale.
4.	Empowering 
employees 
to 
provide 
feedback 
on 
existing 
grievance 
process in order to further 
strengthen it.
Positive 
- 
A 
strong 
workforce 
with 
higher 
engagement and retention 
rate 
enable 
innovation, 
enhances the performance 
and brings in a positive 
culture in the organization.
Negative - The inability 
to 
meet 
workforce 
expectations may result 
in adverse impacts on 
workforce, morale and the 
company’s growth plan in a 
long run productivity.

Occupational 
Health & 
Safety
Risk
The health and safety of our 
employees and workers is of 
utmost significance to the 
organization.
Implementing 
health 
and 
safety measures to reduce 
threats to life and property 
boosts employee confidence.
We offer frequent health 
and safety trainings to all 
employees to promote a 
safe work environment.
Training related to Hazard 
Identification 
and 
Risk 
Assessment (HIRA) and Total 
Productive Maintenance are 
also provided. Independent 
internal & external audit has 
been conducted.
The 
Company 
has 
implemented 
ISO 
45001 
for the health, safety and 
well-being of its employees. 
Various awareness sessions/
trainings are conducted on 
safety related aspects for 
the employees
Negative 
– 
Employee 
and workers safety risks 
if neglected can cause 
fatalities 
and 
loss 
of 
labour force. It also brings 
reputational damage for 
the organization and may 
impact supply of skilled 
manpower which directly 
impacts 
company’s 
productivity. 
7.
Governance 
and ethical 
business 
conduct
Risk
Any breaches or governance 
failings can result in serious 
legal and reputational harm, 
reducing stakeholder trust 
and firm performance. 
1.	Training and awareness 
on best practices 
2.	Clear guidance with policy 
framework
3.	Regular 
audits 
of 
operations
4.	Stakeholder engagement
Negative – Any lapses on 
compliances may lead to 
attracting regulatory fines 
and penalties. It brings 
significant 
reputational 
damages 
and 
loss 
of 
investor 
and 
customer 
confidence.
8.
Transparency, 
accountability 
and reporting
Opportunity
By emphasizing transparency 
and responsibility in reporting, 
KEI Industries may foster 
more 
confidence 
among 
stakeholders like as investors,

well within permissible limits, we are still keen to improve our performance. Towards this, we have/are 
replaced / replacing diesel genset with other cleaner fuels gensets, install additional filtration systems 
at our stack emission outlets to capture emissions or replacing diesel with PNG where there is steady 
PNG infrastructure installed by government.
