our products for reusing, recycling, and disposing of them at the end of their lives. For plastic packaging, we comply 
with the Plastic Waste Management Rules set by the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change (MoEFCC), 
Government of India. Similarly, we adhere to the E-waste Management Rules and other hazardous waste regulations.
	
For hazardous waste, we ensure disposal through authorised recyclers and reprocessors only. We follow a strict regulatory 
procedure, generating manifests on the regulatory authorities’ online hazardous waste disposal system and transporting 
the waste exclusively through authorised transporters. Although we didn’t reclaim any products in the last fiscal year, our 
commitment to environmental compliance and safety remains firm.

Adhering to the principles of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR), we uphold accountability in managing plastic waste 
responsibly under regulatory frameworks. While we do not directly manufacture plastic materials, our EPR obligations 
stem from the plastic waste used in our packaging processes. We diligently meet EPR requirements to fulfil our regulatory 
responsibilities. Through partnerships with authorised EPR service providers and in collaboration with the Gujarat Pollution 
Control Board (GPCB), we play a proactive role in protecting the environment from the risks posed by plastic waste.

environment for all.
	
b)	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis 
by the entity?
	
	
At GFL, we employ a systematic approach to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on both routine and non-
routine bases. Our processes include regular workplace inspections to identify potential hazards and conducting 
risk assessments to evaluate the likelihood and potential consequences of these hazards. We use various tools for 
risk assessment, such as PHA (e.g., HAZOP), Pre-Start-up Safety Review (PSSR), Job Safety Analysis (JSA), Hazard 
Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA), Qualitative Risk Assessment (QRA), Permit to Work System (PTW), and 
Safety Audits of work areas.
	
	
We encourage employees to report any safety concerns or near misses, ensuring that all incidents are promptly 
investigated to identify root causes and implement corrective actions. Additionally, we conduct safety audits through 
trained GFL employees and external experts periodically to monitor compliance with safety protocols. We leverage 
incident data and trend analysis to proactively address emerging risks.
	
c)	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such 
risks. (Y/N)
	
	
Yes, we have established processes that allow and encourage workers to report work-related hazards and effectively 
avoid such risks. GFL promotes and prioritises a culture of open communication and proactive hazards reporting 
to promptly identify potential risks. Employees are encouraged and trained to report any hazards they encounter 
or observe in the workplace through a digital online platform, safety committees, or direct communication with 
supervisors. We track both leading and lagging indicators, along with hazards observed in the plant.
	
	
We identify hazards through various methods such as safety observations, Contractor Field Safety Audits, and Plant 
Monthly Safety Involvement activities. By fostering a reporting culture and providing clear guidelines for employees 
to escalate concerns and remove themselves from risky situations, our organisation demonstrates its commitment 
to prioritising the health and safety of its workforce. We believe that proactive hazard reporting and the ability to 
remove oneself from risks are crucial for maintaining a safe and healthy work environment for all employees.
	
d)	
Do the employees/worker of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services? (Yes/
No)
	
	
Yes. GFL ensures access to medical and health services for our employees and workers that go beyond their 
occupational requirements. We prioritise the well-being of our workforce by conducting regular pre-employment and 
periodic medical check-ups for both our employees and contractual staff. Additionally, we organise dental and health 
check-up camps, blood donation drives, and first aid training programmes to equip our employees and workmen with 
essential life-saving skills.

Gujarat Fluorochemicals Limited
	
We have undertaken several projects aimed at reducing Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions including:
 
Energy Efficiency Optimisation
	
•	
We have implemented various initiatives such as upgrading mechanical components, installing Variable Frequency 
Drives (VFDs), and optimising chilling and cooling operations.
	
•	
These efforts resulted in a significant reduction of 59.11 MWh in energy consumption during 2023-24.
	
•	
Specific actions at our Dahej, Jolva, and Ranjitnagar units include improving pump systems and replacing conventional 
starters with VFDs to achieve substantial energy savings.
	
Renewable Energy Adoption
	
•	
We have made substantial investments in wind turbines with a total capacity of 62 MW.
	
•	
This enables us to fulfil approximately 20% of our indirect energy requirements with clean and sustainable sources, 
reducing our reliance on fossil fuels.
	
Emission Control Measures, Carbon Offsets, and Afforestation
	
•	
Implemented rigorous measures to control emissions and enhance process efficiencies, resulting in a reduction of 
emissions by 10 kg of material released into the atmosphere.
	
•	
Incorporated carbon offset initiatives, including active participation in afforestation projects where we’ve planted 
about 7,336 trees over the past three years to create carbon sinks and promote biodiversity.
	
•	
Engaged in continuous monitoring and reduction efforts to neutralise remaining emissions through targeted 
initiatives.
	
Emission Reduction Targets and Achievements
	
•	
We continuously monitor and strive to reduce emissions across our operations, as evidenced by our progress in 
Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions reductions from 2019-20 to 2023-24.
	
•	
These efforts have resulted in significant reductions in MTCO2e emissions, underscoring our commitment to 
mitigating our environmental impact.
