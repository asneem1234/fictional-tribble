1.
Environment
R
The Dredging Industry and 
Indian maritime sector is set 
for robust growth due to 
increasing demand in the 
Oil and Gas Industry. These 
industries are engaged in 
exploration, 
extraction, 
refining and transportation 
activities. Dredging is vital 
in 
maintaining 
navigable 
waterways, 
constructing 
and 
managing 
offshore 
infrastructure and ensuring 
efficient 
transportation 
of 
goods. Accumulation of waste 
and high tide increases the 
risk of movement of ships 
which would ultimately affect 
transportation activities
Product 
innovation 
emerges as a key trend in 
dredging market and major 
Companies are prioritizing 
the development of cutting 
age solutions. The customise 
options 
are 
tailored 
to 
specific dredging operations. 
Dredging pumps specialised 
for 
removing 
sediments, 
debris and material from 
bodies of water, play a critical 
role in dredging operations 
and 
reducing 
adverse 
environmental impact.
Negative Financial

Procurement process, 
internal and external logistics 
and transportation, quality 
controls, outsourcing and 
vendor relationships are 
inherent part of company’s 
line of business activities. 
 The Dredging Pump designed 
with wear-resistant parts and 
an efficient impeller facilitates 
faster and easier operations 
in areas with varying water 
depths. Basic infrastructure 
like deepening of channels, 
mechanization and creation 
of more berths will create 
demand for dredging industry. 
Creation of new green field 
ports would also drive the 
demand for dredging in the 
domestic market.

Technology
O
Dry dock planning,

Dredgers.
Advance technology is the 
need to evolve dredging 
operations.

of 
advanced

would improve efficiency and 
help to handle more cargo 
by accommodating bigger 
vessels.
Positive Financial

Project 
Management
O
Planning, organizing and 
managing resources to bring 
about successful completion 
of specific project goals is 
important. 
The Sagarmala Project and 
the 
National 
Waterways 
Project 
have 
created 
significant opportunities for 
the Dredging Sector.
-The Unnati Project being 
the global benchmark was 
adopted 
to 
improve 
the 
efficiency and productivity 
KPIs 
for 
12 
major 
ports. 
Around 116 initiatives were 
identified across 12 major 
ports to unlock more than 100 
MTPA capacity just through 
efficiency 
improvement. 
Out of which, 93 initiatives 
have been implemented to 
unlock more than 80 MTPA 
capacity. For all the 12 major 
ports, master plans have been 
finalized.

Maritime 
Sector
O
Indian 
Dredging 
Industry 
is 
driven 
largely 
by 
the 
dredging 
demand 
coming 
from its major and non-major 
ports. Improvement of basic 
infrastructures 
will 
create 
demand for Dredging Industry.
With 
the 
objective 
of 
propelling 
India 
to 
the 
forefront 
of 
the 
Global 
Maritime Sector, Ministry of 
Ports, Shipping and Water 
ways has formulated Maritime 
India 
Vision 
2030 
(MIV 
2030), a blueprint to ensure 
coordinated and accelerated 
growth of India’s maritime 
sector in the next decade. 
MIV 2030 identifies over 150 
initiatives across 10 themes 
covering all the facets of the 
Indian Maritime Sector and 
is a comprehensive effort to 
define and meet National 
Maritime Objectives.

Indian Dredging Companies

Maintenance Dredging Market. 
The 
Maintenance 
Dredging 
market is cramped, with Trailer 
Suction Dredgers of all shapes 
and sizes and of diverse 
origins, chasing the same pie. 
The competition is so intense 
and the price war will only 
have losers in the end.
Dredging Industry is expected 
to be a direct beneficiary with 
recent developments to boost 
domestic 
manufacturing 
as 
well 
as 
Government’s 
focus 
to 
improve 
Indian 
maritime sector. Indian ports 
are 
preparing 
themselves 
to handle more cargo by 
accommodating 
bigger 
vessels and aspire to meet 
international 
standards 
in 
port infrastructure in a bid to 
achieve economies of scale.
