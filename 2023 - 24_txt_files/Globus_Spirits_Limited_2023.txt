targets along-with reasons

Product excellence has been enhanced by producing and using highest quality of 
“ENA” or Extra Neutral Alcohol. The Extra Neutral Alcohol that is fractioned in our 
multi-pressure columns assures higher purity than conventional re-distillation 
techniques thereby providing safer and better tasting beverages, in addition, 
stringent controls over the natural fermentation process ensures that every batch of 
ENA is of high purity and quality. 
Marketing excellence strategy has been in pioneering branding at the bottom of the 
pyramid ‘IMIL’ market as well as creating innovative ‘IMFL’ brands. Organizational 
excellence achieved through the entity’s unique 360° business model, allowing for 
high capacity utilization and operation of high standards of Corporate Governance 
creating value for all of its stakeholders. 
 
Manufacturing excellence was achieved by establishing world-class, fully 
integrated, earth-friendly distilleries that produce reliable products at better 
efficiencies.
