Our focus is on crafting and selling fine jewellery; therefore, the concept of product reclaim does not pertain to our items. Nevertheless, 
we are unwavering in our commitment to sustainability, integrating eco-friendly practices into every aspect of our operations:
a.
Sustainable jewellery: We are deeply committed to the artistry and quality of our pieces, ensuring they adhere to the highest
standards in the industry. Senco Gold & Diamonds believes in creating jewellery pieces meant to be worn for ages and are
sustainable, as opposed to regular junk jewellery, which tarnishes and eventually adds to fashion waste.

its processes with digital onboarding, paperless employee documentation through QR codes, geo-tagging and geo-fencing and
leveraging artificial intelligence to assess employee satisfaction. Furthermore, it has implemented a help desk module, utilizing
Power BI for advanced business intelligence, managing the performance management system (PMS) and the entire employee life
cycle digitally. We have also received the Great Place to Work badge in 2023, and India’s best workplace is in “Health and Wellness
2023” by GPTW.
As a responsible corporate citizen, the company welcomes and supports the ‘Green Initiative’ undertaken by the Ministry of
Corporate Affairs, Government of India. It enables electronic delivery of documents, including the Annual Report, to shareholders 
at their e-mail addresses previously registered with the DPs and RTAs. Shareholders without registered e-mail addresses are
requested to do the same. Those holding shares in demat form can register their e-mail addresses with the concerned DPs.
c.
Sustainable Waste Management: Adequate measures are taken to procure and use safe materials for operations. Pre-determined
places are identified for appropriately storing, segregating, and disposing of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes, following
regulatory and legal requirements. Wherever possible, waste is recycled and reused accordingly.

Senco Gold Limited is dedicated to establishing a safe workplace and promoting environmental sustainability. To this end, air scrubbers 
have been strategically installed within our jewellery manufacturing facilities to meticulously purify exhaust gases before they are 
released into the environment. Specifically, we employ PP FRP scrubbers constructed from a combination of polypropylene (PP) 
and fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP). This combination of materials ensures the scrubbers are both highly durable and possess excellent 
filtration capabilities.
These PP FRP scrubbers are highly efficient and capable of capturing over 90% of airborne pollutants, including particles, acidic gases, 
and other contaminants. By incorporating this advanced air pollution control technology, Senco Gold Limited significantly reduces the 
environmental impact of its manufacturing processes, demonstrating our commitment to sustainable and responsible business practices.
Senco Gold Limited is deeply committed to fostering a safe workplace environment and championing environmental sustainability. We 
have strategically installed air scrubbers within our jewellery manufacturing facilities to uphold these values. These advanced systems
