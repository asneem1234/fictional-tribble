1
Material 
Efficiency, 
Sourcing, and 
Management
Risk
To manufacture wind turbines 
and associated parts/
peripherals, energy and virgin 
materials may  be required. 
This could result in depletion 
of natural resources and 
consumption of energy from 
fossil-based sources.
Reducing the overall weight of 
wind turbine components and 
consumables. Local vendor 
development is promoted.
 Negative
2
Climate 
Change 
Management
Risk
Climate change induced 
physical risks impact wind 
turbine sites. The variability of 
wind due to changing weather 
affects the planned availability 
of wind and ultimately may 
lead to a reduced output.
Extreme climatic events 
such as cyclones, extreme 
rainfall or heat waves hamper 
maintenance activities owing 
to water logging, disruption of 
connectivity, and heat stress.
We are actively incorporating 
renewable energy sources to 
mitigate risks in the transition to a 
low-carbon economy and enhance 
sustainability.
We have planned to conduct 
climate risk assessment (physical 
and transition risks) to ensure 
alignment with TCFD/IFRS S2 
disclosures and comprehend 
potential consequences of climate 
change to further make informed 
decisions about the current & 
future decarbonization plans
3
Waste 
Management
Risk
Management of some 
categories of waste, such 
as the turbine-blades is 
industrywide challenge. While 
certain portion of the waste is 
reused, some waste is being 
sent off-site to incineration/ 
landfilling facilities. 
Incineration produces air 
pollutants. This could potently 
contaminate groundwater and 
emit greenhouse gases.
Waste generated is managed in a 
responsible manner. Suzlon has 
partnered with authorized waste 
management vendors to dispose/
recycle waste generated during 
operations. 
We are focusing on waste 
handling and management and 
on strengthening adoption of 
sustainability using 3 R’s (Reduce-
Reuse-Recycle) Principles. 
The waste generated during 
manufacturing is sent to cement 
company and used as alternate 
fuel. Furthermore, waste material 
generated during manufacturing 
and packaging is recycled and 
reused within the Plants.

Occupational 
Health and 
Safety
Risk
Health and Safety hazards 
are intrinsic to manufacturing, 
commissioning and operations 
& maintenance activities. 
Despite implemented systems 
and controls by Suzlon, any 
slippage can result into an 
incident and injury.
A culture of safety where 
employees feel empowered 
to report hazards and can 
further enhance workplace 
safety has been developed. A 
comprehensive health hazard 
identification and mitigation 
system is in place.
We are also implementing Kaizen 
5 S at Plant Level which includes 
Seiri (Sort), Seiton (Straighten), 
Seiso (Shine), Seiketsu 
(Standardize), and Shitsuke 
(Sustain).
Regular trainings to our employees 
are provided in accordance with 
training calendar and customized 
needs as per job specific hazards.
The training topics include proper 
use of equipment, emergency 
procedures, hazard recognition, 
and safe work practices.
The Mock Drills, Safety Walks, 
Toolbox Talks are organized on 
continuous basis. We adhere to 
maintain Hazard Identification and 
Risk Assessment (HIRA), Site-
specific Emergency Response 
Plan (ERP), First Aid Register and 
Accident Investigation Register 
(AIR) across all our locations.
Further we are tracking the 
number of such incidents diligently 
so that we may conduct a proper 
root cause analysis of such 
incidents and take proactive 
measure which shall help us 
to reduce and mitigate such 
incidences.
The health checkup for all 
employees and workers are 
carried out during induction and 
on annual basis.

Sustainable 
Supply Chain 
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Supply chains can 
expose us to hidden and 
uncontrollable ESG risks 
such as depletion of natural 
resources, human rights 
abuses, workforce health and 
safety incidents. 
Opportunity: Supply chains 
present a huge opportunity 
to accelerate progress 
on sustainability goals by 
focusing on human rights, 
labour practices, and 
environmental impacts.
Suppliers are onboarded 
only if they meet the requisite 
parameters – quality, cost 
effectiveness, and timeliness apart 
from ESG considerations. We also 
pay attention to the suppliers’ 
impact on human rights – child 
labour, fair wages, and others. 
We carry our supplier audits 
and vendor meets at regular 
intervals to highlight concerns and 
exchange learnings. The Supply 
Chain Due Diligence procedures 
and assessment of suppliers 
during onboarding and monitoring 
on annual basis is already under 
implementation.
Further, we are planning to 
develop a comprehensive supply 
chain management framework 
that will serve as a tool to help us 
identify key areas for improvement 
and therefore mitigate risks 
and leverage the opportunities 
associated with robust supply 
chain management.
Positive

Business 
Ethics and 
Integrity
Risk
Owing to the intrinsic 
nature of material topic 
and the potential of severe 
consequences in the event of 
minor deviation from existing 
protocols
We adhere to a strong ethical 
standard of integrity. Our directors 
and senior management follow a 
strict code of conduct and ethics. 
Effective internal control systems 
and a whistle blower mechanism 
is in place. The adequacy of these 
systems is regularly evaluated by 
the management assurance team 
and risk management team.
Furthermore, we have continuous 
monitoring procedures for 
recording data and ensuring 
alignment with our Code of Ethics 
and have robust monitoring 
procedures along with availability 
of Helpline in multiple regional 
languages for “Whistleblower and 
Reporting”.

Dear Stakeholders,
I am pleased to present Suzlon’s Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report, which showcases our dedication to sustainability and 
outlines our commitment to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles.
Environmental Responsibility: At Suzlon, we understand the significance of our impact on environmental footprint and contributing 
to a sustainable future. One of the primary challenges faced by wind turbine manufacturers worldwide is mitigating the effects of 
manufacturing and installation and impacts on environment across the entire Concept to Commissioning (C2C). To mitigate the same, we 
have made substantial investments in research and development to eliminate or minimize such impact. We have undertaken Stakeholder 
Engagement and Materiality Assessment (SEMA) and have incorporated the findings to build up a well-articulated and robust framework 
for sustainability to be implemented by Suzlon along with a concrete roadmap. We are working on 3 R’s and reducing our impact on Waste 
generation and disposal.

Lakh households in underserved regions. We are working continuously with communities and believe in community engagement as an 
important tool to make significant impact aligned to Suzlon’s CSR strategy.
Governance: Transparent and ethical governance forms the foundation of our business operations. Maintaining a high standard of 
corporate governance across a diverse portfolio spread over numerous decentralized and often remote operating locations is always 
a critical challenge. We take pride in the fact that our Company has consistently and successfully maintained a robust governance 
framework, with all our projects adhering to stringent regulatory and compliance standards. As we look ahead, we remain committed to 
continuous improvement and raising the bar even higher.
We are committed to conducting a comprehensive evaluation and taking action for reducing carbon emissions and work towards carbon 
reductions strategy Suzlon is working towards implementation of actions for materiality indicators of significance for Suzlon and monitoring 
progress of initiatives undertaken. Additionally, we are continuously striving to improve our engagement with local communities and 
provide human rights training. We believe that that our suppliers and business partners are an important pillar for achieving holistic 
sustainability therefore we also take up ESG Assessment for suppliers. Our Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report reaffirms 
our strong commitment to ESG principles and our goal of making a long-lasting positive impact. We are determined to continue our 
sustainability efforts and believe that, with your ongoing support, we can create a greener, more inclusive, and responsible future for 
future generations.

12.	 Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy workplace.
	
Following are the key measures implemented by the organization to guarantee safety and health in the workplace.:
	
•	
HSE Policy: The HSE policy is effectively communicated through different channels like emails and prominently displayed 
at multiple locations within plants, sites, and offices. Moreover, the policy is displayed in the local or national language 
to facilitate easy understanding. Additionally, it forms an integral part of HSE induction training sessions.
	
•	
HIRA: Hazard identification and risk assessment involves evaluating the risks associated with both routine and non-
routine activities. Each hazard is assessed based on a rating scale, with the risk score determined by multiplying the 
severity and probability of the hazard. The highest rating is considered critical (ranging from P1xS4 to P4xS4), while 
moderate and low risks are categorized as significant (ranging from P1xS3 to P4xS2) and insignificant (P1xS1).
	
•	
PPE - It is the management’s responsibility to ensure that all necessary and relevant Personal Protective Equipment 
(PPE) is being used by the workforce and no one is violating PPE usage protocols and complying with them. The PPE 
Inventory and record-keeping and inspection procedures are in place and adequate PPEs are always maintained to 
ensure availability at all times.
	
•	
Trainings - The organization offers both specific and general trainings to its employees and those in the value chain to 
ensure their safety. Some of the general training modules include induction training, first aid, firefighting, emergency 
preparedness and response, etc. Additionally, specific training modules such as work at height, confined space, energy 
isolation/LOTO, electrically qualified professional training, etc., are also provided. The Mock Drill trainings are also being 
carried out along with other safety related trainings at regular intervals as per training calendar.
	
•	
Safety committee - The organization ensures that the workforce is empowered to refuse work in hazardous situations or 
until a sufficient safe work system is provided to them. The workforce may notify the respective site/plant in-charge about 
any hazards present or involved in their tasks. Safety committee meetings serve as a platform for addressing health 
and safety concerns. The safety committee consists of representatives from both management and workers (including 
contract personnel), with a mandatory 50% representation from each side. The meeting is led by the respective plant 
head / project manager. The workers’ representative is tasked with emphasizing the safety of workers in the workplace 
and bringing workers’ concerns to the attention of management. The management representative is responsible for 
implementing and enhancing the existing safety measures in the workplace.

hazardous situation or until adequate safe system of work is provided to them. Workforce has all right to inform the 
respective site / plant in-charge about the hazards present / involved in the jobs. Workers are provided with detailed job 
safety analysis and permit to work systems which are prepared based on their feedback and in consultation with them.
	
•	
Communication - Various types of communication modes are used for disseminating information pertaining to HSE 
namely HSE policy, safety committee meetings, sign and display boards, banners and poster, employee desktop 
wallpapers etc. Testing and preventive maintenance - It is ensured that equipment and tools are tested, calibrated and 
preventive maintenance conducted.

communication channels, such as email, e-portal, Community Advisory Panel (CAP) meetings, questionnaires, and personal 
visits, to actively engage with stakeholders. This approach facilitates a comprehensive understanding and identification of 
significant topics, allowing Suzlon Group to assess the importance of concerns and gain a clear understanding of the issues 
raised.

Leadership Indicators
1.	
Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and 
social topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.
	
The responsibility of consulting with stakeholders on ESG topics has been entrusted to the various departments within 
the organization. These departments are also responsible for maintaining continuous engagement with stakeholders. With 
respect to ESG, the company follows a consistent approach and prepares for them through these consultations. The most 
significant issues are identified and prioritized based on their impact on both our stakeholders and our business.
	
The consultation processes between stakeholders and the Board, regarding economic, environmental, and social topics, 
are entrusted to Suzlon Foundation. This foundation is a section 8 Company that has been mandated to lead corporate 
social responsibility at Suzlon. The processes and methods used by Suzlon Foundation to facilitate these consultations are 
transparent and aligned with Suzlon’s core values of Agility, Creativity, Value addition, Commitment, and Integrity.
	
The Suzlon Foundation initiated the process by identifying key stakeholders according to their importance and influence 
on the business. These stakeholders comprised of customers, employees, suppliers, investors, local communities, NGOs, 
and regulatory authorities. The Stakeholder mapping entailed classifying stakeholders based on their interests, power, and 
degree of influence and impact on the Company’s operations and choices.
	
This process helped to prioritize engagement efforts. Various channels for stakeholder consultation, such as surveys, 
interviews, focus groups, public meetings, online platforms, and formal dialogues were used. Feedback obtained from 
stakeholder consultations was compiled and reported to the Executive Governance Body (EG) to ensure that stakeholder 
perspectives are considered in decision-making.
	
Annual General Meetings (AGMs) serve as a platform for stakeholders, including shareholders and other interested parties, to 
raise concerns and ask question directly to the Board and senior management. Suzlon has established a feedback mechanism, 
in the form of a dedicated email address, through which stakeholders can provide comments, suggestions, or complaints 
directly to the Company. Suzlon Foundation conducts materiality assessments to identify the most significant economic, 
environmental, and social issues for stakeholders and the Company. This process helps focus consultation efforts on key 
topics. The feedback obtained from stakeholder consultations informs the organization’s decision-making and strategies. It 
also drives continuous improvement in the organization’s economic, environmental, and social performance. In addition to 
direct engagement, Suzlon Foundation on behalf of Suzlon Group collaborates with external stakeholders, such as NGOs, 
industry associations, and expert groups, to gain insights and feedback on relevant topics. These transparent and meaningful 
consultation with stakeholders helps to make informed decisions that align with the long-term interests of the organization 
and its stakeholders.

Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, and 
social topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these 
topics were incorporated into policies and activities of the entity.
	
Yes
	
Stakeholder consultation is often used to support the identification and management of environmental and social topics. A 
detailed Stakeholder Engagement and Materiality Assessment (SEMA) was undertaken by Suzlon that enabled company in 
carving ESG roadmap and focusing on relevant issues that are of significance in short-term, mid-term and long-term. Suzlon 
Foundation a Section 8 Company mandated to lead Suzlon CSR was set up to support underprivileged sections of society, 
create opportunities and strive towards a more equitable society. The Foundation engages with the community in a variety of 
areas that serve the vulnerable / marginalized stakeholder groups. Involvement of stakeholders has been instrumental in the 
identification of important environmental and social matters that are pertinent to the organization and its stakeholders. The 
inputs provided by stakeholders have been beneficial in shaping the content and direction of the organization’s sustainability 
reports, guaranteeing that the most significant issues are openly disclosed. Stakeholders’ viewpoints are taken into account 
during materiality assessments, which have aided in the identification of the most relevant environmental and social topics for 
the organization.
	
The materiality matrix reflects the significance of each topic to both the Company and its stakeholders. It plays a crucial 
role in guiding the Company’s prioritization of efforts and allocation of resources in the right direction to focus on issues 
that are significant for company. The input from stakeholders has been instrumental in the development and revision of key 
environmental and social programs. This ensures that these programs align with stakeholder expectations and effectively 
address the most significant concerns. In Suzlon’s community engagement programs, stakeholder consultation is of utmost 
importance. The input from local communities has significantly influenced the initiatives and actions taken to address their 
specific needs and concerns. Similarly, the input from employees, who are important stakeholders, has shaped initiatives that 
focus on promoting employee well-being, work-life balance, diversity, and inclusion, as well as health and safety. Regular 
stakeholder engagement forums, roundtable discussions, and public consultations provide valuable opportunities for 
stakeholders to express their views. Stakeholder consultation is also integrated into the organization’s issue resolution and 
grievance mechanisms to ensure that any concerns raised by stakeholders are appropriately addressed and resolved. This 
approach not only fosters trust and transparency but also enables the organization to effectively tackle environmental and 
social challenges, ultimately creating long-term value for both the Company and its stakeholders.
3.	
Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/ 
marginalized stakeholder groups.
	
Suzlon has actively engaged with and responded to the concerns of vulnerable and marginalized stakeholder groups. By 
directly consulting with these communities, Suzlon has gained valuable insights into their specific needs, challenges, and 
aspirations within their respective geographical areas.
	
One notable example of Suzlon’s engagement is in Rajasthan, India, where a severe drought had led to acute water scarcity 
for the rural community. Recognizing the negative impact this had on the lives of the people, particularly in rural areas where 
water sources were rapidly depleting, Suzlon acted.
	
As part of its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives, Suzlon made the decision to address the water needs of these 
communities in a sustainable manner. This proactive approach demonstrates Suzlon’s commitment to making a positive 
difference in the lives of vulnerable and marginalized groups.
	
We implemented a comprehensive program focused on water conservation and management, specifically targeting rainwater 
harvesting, pond desilting, and check dam construction. Suzlon collaborated with local NGOs, government authorities, and 
community members to identify adequate locations for rainwater harvesting structures. These structures were designed to 
capture rainwater during the monsoon season, which could then be stored for use during the dry months.
	
In addition, the Company established check dams and recharge wells in critical areas to replenish the groundwater table. 
These structures effectively prevented water runoff and facilitated the replenishment of underground aquifers.
	
Over time, the positive impact of the Company’s CSR water initiatives became evident. The availability of water increased 
in the region, providing relief to the communities during droughts. This improved access to water contributed to better 
agricultural yields, enhanced livelihoods, and improved sanitation conditions. Furthermore, the water conservation efforts had 
174
Annual Report 2023-24
a positive environmental impact, as water-dependent ecosystems began to rejuvenate. The region’s biodiversity also showed 
signs of recovery, benefiting both plant and animal life.
	
The Company’s approach to addressing water needs in Rajasthan not only fulfilled a critical need but also fostered a sense of 
ownership and pride within the local communities. By involving them in the planning and implementation of these initiatives, 
the Company established strong bonds with the people it served.
	
Company’s CSR-driven water conservation and management program in Rajasthan exemplified a sustainable and community-
centric approach to addressing a vital need, ensuring the well-being of the people and the environment in the region.
	
Company launched a comprehensive program named “Zero Dependency” to empower and uplift individuals with disabilities 
in the villages where they were present. Suzlon collaborated with local NGOs, disability organizations, and community leaders 
to comprehend the specific challenges faced by the disabled population and develop targeted interventions.

Suzlon prioritizes sustainable development and the involvement of all stakeholders in its journey of sustainability. The 
community holds significant importance as a stakeholder.
	
Establishing a grievance mechanism for impacted communities is crucial for handling and resolving project-related grievances 
effectively. By implementing a robust grievance handling procedure, the organization can maintain a harmonious environment.
	
The primary objective of the grievance redressal mechanism is to provide communities with a local avenue for resolving 
issues, offering an alternative to external dispute resolution processes such as legal or administrative systems.
	
The mechanism to receive and redress grievances of the community is defined as below:
	
Any individual belonging to the Community has the right to raise a grievance. The term “Community” in this context includes 
the Members residing in the village where the wind turbine or factory is situated, as well as the villages through which there 
is transit for business purposes. However, it does not include employees, vendors, or suppliers who may reside in the village, 
as they have alternative mechanisms to address their grievances. The affected Community Members have the option to raise 
their grievances with the relevant competent Authority, such as the Site in-charge, area in-charge, section in-charge, project 
Manager, or Heads of departments. Furthermore, the affected Community can choose to raise their grievance through various 
modes, including telephone, email, or direct meetings.
	
The Grievance can be officially registered in accordance with Grievance Redressal Procedure adopted by Suzlon. Furthermore, 
the External Grievances related to Community can also be captured through a helpline (available in multi-lingual mode) which 
enables an additional mechanism to capture and address community related grievances, if any
	
Registering the Grievance: The Suzlon employees from manufacturing locations/project sites/operations who receives a 
complaint is required to report it to the state CSR Manager within 48 hours of receiving the complaint. The complaint should 
include the complainant’s name, address, phone number, details of the issue, and the desired resolution. Even if the complaint 
does not initially appear to be a grievance, it is still documented for review by the committee to determine its eligibility.

Grievance resolution: The complaint is reviewed by the appropriate individuals from the Grievance Redressal Cell, as 
designated by the relevant committee member of the department, and a formal response will be provided to the complainant 
within 45 days. If the response is not acceptable to the complainant, then it will be escalated, and the grievance redressal 
committee of the company will respond to the complainant within 15 days.
	
GRC and Committee: The Grievance Redressal Cell and Committee is required to conclude their proceedings within 60 days 
from the time the complaint is registered. The resolution will be documented and communicated to the complainant through 
telephone, written correspondence, or email, depending on the circumstances. Nevertheless, the complainant is free to seek 
alternative dispute resolution mechanisms if needed.
