Energy 
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk Perspective: 
Fluctuations in energy 
prices can directly impact 
SMIL's operating costs. 
Dependence on non-
renewable energy sources 
can lead to vulnerability in 
the face of price volatility. 
Global energy supply chain 
disruptions, geopolitical 
tensions, or natural disasters 
can affect the availability 
and cost of energy resources, 
impacting SMIL's production 
and distribution processes. 
Governments worldwide are 
implementing stricter energy 
related regulations to address 
climate change and reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions. 
Non-compliance with these 
regulations can result in fines 
and legal liabilities for SMIL.
Opportunity Perspective: 
Implementing energy efficient 
technologies, process 
optimizations, and renewable 
energy solutions can lead to 
significant cost savings in the 
long run. Streamlining energy 
consumption can optimize 
production processes, reduce 
downtime, and increase 
overall productivity. Shifting 
to renewable energy sources
Energy management involves 
the strategic planning, 
monitoring, and optimization 
of energy use throughout 
the Company's operations. 
The Company has adopted 
renewable energy sources 
including solar and wind 
power. The Company 
has installed automatic 
sensors for cutting off the 
electricity of heavy motors 
and machinery when not in 
use. To ensure conservation 
of energy, the Company has 
adopted energy efficient 
equipments. The Company 
aims to improve the 
environmental performance 
by adopting cleaner 
production methods.
It promotes the use of energy 
efficient and environment 
friendly technologies and use 
of renewable energy.
Positive Financial 
Implications: Implementing 
energy efficient technologies 
and practices can result 
in lower utility bills and 
decreased energy-related 
expenses, positively 
impacting SMIL's bottom 
line. As energy costs 
continue to rise, companies 
with efficient energy 
management strategies can 
gain a competitive edge by 
offering cost-competitive 
products and services. Attract 
environmentally conscious 
consumers and investors, 
positively influencing SMIL's 
brand value and market 
position.
Negative Financial 
Implications: Failing to 
address energy inefficiencies 
may lead to higher operating 
expenses and decreased 
profitability. Non-compliance 
with energy related 
regulations can result in 
fines, penalties, and potential 
damage to SMIL’s reputation.
and adopting energy-efficient 
practices aligns with SMIL’s 
commitment to sustainability, 
enhancing its reputation 
among environmentally 
conscious customers, 
investors, and stakeholders.

Physical 
impacts 
of climate 
change
Risk
Risk perspective: The 
physical impacts of climate 
change present significant 
risks to Sharda Motor 
Industries Limited (SMIL) 
and the automotive industry. 
Climate change refers 
to long-term changes in 
global or regional climate 
patterns, which have 
significant implications for 
businesses, communities, 
and ecosystems. The physical 
impacts of climate change 
can directly affect SMIL's 
operations, facilities, supply 
chains, and overall business 
continuity. These risks include 
disruptions to operations 
and supply chains due to 
extreme weather events, 
potential shortages of critical 
resources like water, rising 
energy costs to comply with 
emission regulations and 
vulnerability of infrastructure. 
Climate change-induced shifts 
in consumer preferences and 
liability issues further add to 
the risks.
The Company is managing 
these risks by identifying 
and assessing the specific 
climate-related risks to 
SMIL's operations, facilities, 
and supply chain locations. 
Investing in climate-resilient 
infrastructure designs that 
can withstand extreme 
weather events and 
changing climate conditions. 
Diversifying Suppliers and 
Transportation Routes by 
reducing reliance on single 
suppliers or transportation 
routes that may be 
vulnerable to climate-related 
disruptions. 
Implementing water 
conservation measures and 
exploring water recycling 
and reuse strategies to 
ensure water resilience. 
The Company is focused 
on addressing climate 
change challenges and build 
resilience. For example, 
the Company has made 
several efforts to minimize 
its environmental impact 
and has shifted to alternative 
sources of energy, through 
adoption of solar and 
wind power. The Company 
ensures responsible and 
sustainable business conduct 
throughout its value chain. 
Furthermore, the Company 
has implemented various 
water efficient technologies 
to ensure conservation and 
responsible use of water 
during operations including 
water recycling plants and 
water treatment system, 
which has ensured recycling 
of water and zero liquid 
discharge outside plant 
premises.
Negative financial 
implications: Property 
Damage and Repair Costs: 
Extreme weather events and 
rising sea levels can lead to 
physical damage to SMIL's 
facilities, necessitating costly 
repairs or replacements. 
Supply Chain Disruptions: 
Climate-related disruptions 
to transportation routes 
or supplier operations 
can lead to delays in raw 
material delivery, production 
slowdowns, and increased 
costs for alternative sourcing. 
Increased Insurance Costs: 
As climate change-related 
risks become more apparent, 
insurance premiums for 
business properties and 
assets may rise, impacting 
SMIL's operating expenses. 
Business Continuity Costs: 
SMIL may incur expenses 
related to contingency plans 
and resilience measures 
to mitigate the impact of 
climate-related risks on its 
operations.
3
Waste and 
Hazardous 
material 
management
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk perspective: Improper 
waste handling and disposal 
can lead to environmental 
degradation, resulting 
in regulatory fines and 
reputational loss for the 
Company. Furthermore, 
waste management can be 
costly, particularly if the 
organisation is required to 
establish new systems and 
technologies in order to meet 
environmental standards. 
Inadequate handling of 
hazardous materials can lead 
to workplace accidents and 
health risks for employees,
The Company ensures waste 
management through proper 
disposal and recycling 
methods and is compliant 
with various environmental 
regulations. The Company 
aims for optimum utilisation 
of natural and manmade 
resources and sustainability 
of resources by reducing, 
reusing, recycling, and 
managing waste. The 
Company regularly assesses 
waste and hazardous 
material management 
processes, identifying areas 
for improvement and
Negative financial 
implications: Poor waste 
management practices can 
lead to increased costs, 
fines, and legal penalties. In 
addition, waste management 
has negative cost implication 
due to the implementation of 
new systems and technologies 
to meet environmental 
regulations. This can result in 
short-term financial impacts 
such as increased capital 
expenditure. Accidents related 
to hazardous materials can 
lead to medical expenses, 
worker downtime, and

liabilities. Compliance with 
strict regulations regarding 
the storage, handling, and 
disposal of hazardous 
materials is essential to 
avoid penalties and legal 
consequences.
Opportunity perspective: 
By minimising waste disposal 
costs and optimising resource 
utilisation, effective waste 
management practices 
can result in cost savings. 
Recycling waste can also 
lead to more cost-effective 
industrial processes and 
demonstrate environmental 
care. Adequate waste 
management may also 
help the organisation in 
meeting environmental 
standards while fostering 
great connections with the 
surrounding community.

affecting SMIL’s operational 
costs. If hazardous materials 
cause environmental 
contamination, SMIL may 
incur substantial costs for 
environmental remediation 
and restoration.

Water 
Resilience
Opportunity
Opportunity perspective: 
Focusing on water resilience 
can improve resource 
efficiency, conservation and 
access to shared resources. 
It can also prevent supply 
chain disruptions and 
address various water-
related challenges. By 
implementing effective water 
management practices, the 
Company can reduce its 
exposure to water related 
risks, such as water scarcity 
and regulatory restrictions. 
This can help the Company 
to achieve more efficient use 
of water resources, reducing 
operational costs and 
enhancing overall business 
sustainability.
The Company has various 
water efficiency measures 
where it has implemented 
water-saving technologies 
and practices to optimize 
water use in manufacturing 
processes and facility 
operations including water 
recycling plants and water 
treatment system, which 
have ensured recycling of 
water and zero discharge 
outside plant premises.
Risk assessment exercise of 
the Company also includes 
water risk assessment to 
identify water-related risks 
and vulnerabilities in SMIL’s 
operations and supply chain. 
The Company also has 
diversified water sourcing 
strategies such as rainwater 
harvesting, water recycling, 
and engaging in community 
water management 
initiatives. The company has 
also established robust water 
monitoring and reporting 
systems to track water usage, 
identify inefficiencies, and 
demonstrate transparent 
Negative financial 
implications: Water shortages 
or interruptions in water 
supply can lead to production 
disruptions and increased 
costs to secure alternative 
water sources or adjust 
manufacturing processes. In 
regions with water scarcity, 
water prices may rise, 
leading to higher operating 
expenses for SMIL's water-
intensive operations. Meeting 
regulatory requirements 
related to water usage 
and discharge may require 
investments in water-saving 
technologies and wastewater 
treatment facilities.
Positive financial 
implications: Reduced 
operational costs due to 
more efficient use of water 
resources, improved overall 
business sustainability, 
and the potential for new 
market opportunities and 
revenue streams through the 
development of innovative 
water-efficient products and 
services. Additionally, a strong

Product 
design and 
safety
Opportunity
Opportunity perspective: 
Product design and safety 
are critical aspects of 
SMIL's operations. The way 
products are designed, 
manufactured, and tested 
can significantly impact 
their safety, quality, and 
compliance with regulations. 
Effective product design 
and safety practices can 
lead to enhanced customer 
satisfaction, brand reputation, 
and market competitiveness. 
Prioritizing product safety 
and quality in design can 
lead to products that perform 
well, are reliable, and meet 
customer expectations, 
enhancing overall customer 
satisfaction. A reputation for 
safe and reliable products 
can differentiate SMIL from 
competitors, attract more 
customers, and strengthen the 
company's market position. 
Investing in robust product 
design and safety can reduce 
the likelihood of recalls and 
safety incidents, leading 
to cost savings associated 
with potential liabilities and 
reputational damage.
The Company ensures 
manufacturing & Supply of 
all its products including 
Complete Exhaust System 
and Catalytic Converter 
Assemblies by Protecting 
Environment and 
Enhancing Environmental 
Performance. The Company 
is committed towards 
manufacturing products 
which are safe to use and 
is constantly engaged in 
new product development 
technologies leading 
to product innovation 
and enhancement. The 
technological shifts 
happening in the industry in 
accordance with the climate 
change conditions have 
given it another opportunity 
to invest further in R&D 
initiatives, improving the 
designs and creating efficient 
and sustainable products.
Positive financial 
implications: A reputation 
for safe products can lead to 
increased customer loyalty, 
repeat purchases, and positive 
word-of-mouth, driving higher 
sales and market share. 
Avoiding product recalls and 
safety incidents can prevent 
significant financial losses 
related to recall expenses, 
legal fees, and brand recovery 
efforts. A strong focus on 
product safety and quality 
can enhance SMIL's brand 
value and differentiate it as 
a trusted and responsible 
automotive manufacturer.
6
Responsible 
supply chain 
and material 
sourcing 
efficiency
Risk and 
opportunity
Risk perspective: Unethical 
practices in the supply 
chain, such as forced labour 
or child labour, can lead 
to reputational damage 
and legal liabilities for 
SMIL. Overreliance on a 
single supplier or sourcing 
materials from high-risk 
regions can result in supply 
chain disruptions due to 
geopolitical tensions, natural 
disasters, or other unforeseen 
events. Unsustainable 
material sourcing and 
supply chain practices can 
contribute to environmental 
degradation and increase the 
company's carbon footprint. 
Opportunity perspective: 
Building strong relationships 
with responsible suppliers 
can lead to improved 
collaboration, reliability, 
and long-term partnerships. 
Working with suppliers who 
prioritize sustainability can
The Company has proactively 
established a comprehensive 
sustainability policy and 
an environmental, health, 
and safety policy to foster 
sustainable sourcing 
practices across its entire 
value chain. Through the 
implementation of these 
policies, the Company 
prioritizes responsible 
sourcing, emphasizing 
environmental sustainability 
in collaboration with its 
value chain partners. The 
ultimate goal is to ensure 
sustainable sourcing 
practices while minimizing 
any adverse environmental 
impact. By adhering to its 
Environment & Sustainability 
Policy, the Company actively 
promotes environmental 
consciousness among its 
value chain partners. This 
commitment to sustainability 
extends to
Negative financial 
implications: Shifting to 
responsible sourcing may 
require identifying new 
suppliers and integrating 
them into the supply chain, 
which could lead to increased 
complexity and administrative 
costs. Depending on the 
availability and reliability 
of responsible suppliers, 
there could be a risk of 
supply chain disruptions, 
leading to production delays 
and potential revenue 
losses. Positive financial 
implications: Efficient 
supply chain management 
and responsible material 
sourcing can lead to cost 
savings through optimized 
procurement, reduced waste, 
and improved resource 
utilization. A responsible 
supply chain reduces the 
risk of non-compliance, legal 
issues, and supply chain

Protection of 
Human Rights
Risk
Risk perspective: Allegations 
or incidents of human rights 
violations, whether within 
the company or its supply 
chain, can severely tarnish 
SMIL's reputation and impact 
customer trust and brand 
loyalty. Non-compliance 
with labour laws or unethical 
labour practices, such as 
forced labour or child labour, 
can lead to legal liabilities, 
reputational damage, and 
potential boycotts from 
customers and investors. 
Inadequate monitoring and 
due diligence can expose the 
company to supply chain 
risks related to human rights 
abuses. Discrimination or 
lack of diversity and inclusion 
may cause internal turmoil, 
employee dissatisfaction, and 
higher employee turnover.
The Company has formulated 
a human rights policy which 
extends to all its stakeholders 
and ensures protection and 
respect of human rights 
through non-discrimination, 
non-tolerance towards 
child labour and equal 
opportunities for all. Link for 
Human rights policy SMIL 
has also implemented an 
effective grievance redressal 
mechanism to allow 
employees and stakeholders 
to raise concerns related 
to human rights violations. 
SMIL also provide training 
and awareness programs 
for employees to promote a 
culture of respect for human 
rights and ethical behaviour.
The Company has 
implemented a supplier code 
of conduct that sets clear 
expectations for suppliers 
regarding human rights, 
labour practices, and ethical 
standards.
Negative financial 
implications: Violations 
of human rights issues can 
cause significant amount of 
regulatory and legal costs, loss 
of goodwill, higher employee 
turnover costs, also loss of 
investments.

Productivity: Engaged and 
well-supported employees are 
more likely to be motivated, 
focused, and productive, 
contributing to higher overall 
organizational efficiency. 
Reduced Employee 
Turnover: A positive work 
environment, along with 
support for employee 
wellbeing, can lead to 
increased employee retention, 
reducing recruitment and 
training costs. 
Talent Attraction: SMIL's 
reputation as a caring and 
employee-centric organization 
can attract top talent seeking 
a workplace that prioritizes 
well-being and fosters 
professional growth.
Innovation and Creativity:  
Engaged employees tend to 
be more innovative
The Company, through its 
employee engagement 
initiatives, works towards 
encouraging its workforce. 
The Company understands 
that a motivated workforce 
and an avenue for individual 
growth of employees can 
directly contribute to the 
common objective of the 
Company.

implications: Enhanced 
employee engagement results 
in positive workplace culture 
that leads to higher retention

Labour 
practices
Opportunity
Opportunity perspective: 
Labour practices encompass 
a wide range of employment 
related policies and initiatives 
that ensure fair treatment, 
respect, and support for 
all employees within SMIL. 
By fostering a positive and 
inclusive work environment, 
the company can promote 
employee satisfaction, 
productivity, and overall 
well-being. Emphasizing 
responsible labour practices 
not only aligns with SMIL's 
commitment to corporate 
responsibility but also 
strengthens the organization's 
reputation as an employer of 
choice.
Positive financial 
implication: Efficient labour 
management practices boosts 
employee productivity, lowers 
labour absenteeism. The 
increase in the employees’ 
morale can have a direct 
impact on the growth and 
development of the Company 
with an increase in the 
revenue streams.
10
Occupational 
health and 
safety
Risk
Risk perspective: Poor 
health and safety practices 
can contribute to employee 
dissatisfaction, low morale, 
reduced productivity, and 
high staff turnover. Such 
turnover can lead to increased 
recruitment and training 
costs, creating a financial 
burden for the Company. 
Ensuring employee health and 
safety is essential to mitigate 
these risks and maintain a 
positive work environment. 
Workplace accidents and 
injuries can lead to increased 
compensation claims and 
financial constraints on the 
Company. Failure to comply 
with occupational health 
and safety regulations can 
result in legal liabilities, non-
compliances and reputational 
damage.
Safety training: The 
Company provides regular 
and specific training to 
employees on safety 
protocols, procedures and 
the use of machinery and 
equipment. 
Safety Policy and 
Procedures: The Company 
has developed and enforced 
clear safety policies and 
procedures to create a 
safe work environment. 
Regular equipment 
maintenance: Regular 
maintenance of equipment 
and machinery to reduce 
the risk of accidents due to 
malfunctioning equipment. 
Employee involvement: 
The Company encourages 
employee involvement in 
safety initiatives, reporting 
hazards, and suggesting 
improvements.
Positive financial 
implications: A safe 
workplace can help in 
reducing accidents and 
illnesses, which leads 
to fewer claims, lesser 
insurance costs, and greater 
efficiency. This will keep the 
workforce contented and 
happy, which may reduce 
employee turnover, resulting 
in cost savings and enhanced 
profitability. 
Negative financial 
implications: Potential 
legal obligations, increased 
insurance premiums, 
employee compensation 
claims, and lost productivity 
due to injuries or illnesses are 
all financial consequences 
of occupational health and 
safety concerns for SMIL. 
These costs can be significant 
and may have an impact on 
the Company's profitability 
and reputation.

a catalyst within the supply chain. Governed by the sustainability policy, we integrate sustainability 
considerations into all business decisions, functions and work processes. Furthermore, with the aim of 
creating value and contributing to sustainable development the Company procures goods and services 
from local and small producers, including communities surrounding the place of work, to improve the 
capacity and capability of local and small vendors.  We have developed and implemented procurement 
practices in line with automotive industry standards and require our suppliers to also establish policies, 
management systems, and due diligence measures to adequately address risks, which we are ensuring 
through our purchase agreement and PO. Our suppliers comply with our Code of Conduct for stakeholders 
with all applicable laws and regulations, forming contractual obligations to SMIL. 
Our Sustainability requirements form an important part of the sourcing process, and we evaluate new 
and existing suppliers’ performance. The suppliers are re-evaluated as a routine, once every 3 years, or 
as required. 
For the year 2023-24, our sustainable procurement stands at 72.77%. We have sourced materials of Rs

supply chain. By prioritizing the use of reusable trolleys, we effectively eliminate the need for packaging 
material reclamation. Since our goods are transported using these trolleys, we do not generate much 
packaging waste. Additionally, our vendors do not keep the trolleys; instead, they return them to us, 
ensuring their continued reuse.

8.	 Does the entity have any project related to reducing Greenhouse gas emissions? 
	
If “Yes”, then provide details. 
We have undertaken a multitude of initiatives to mitigate our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions:
•	
Our company strictly adheres to the prescribed permissible limits set by CPCB/SPCB for air emissions, 
effluent quality and discharge, solid and hazardous waste generation, and their disposal. Moreover, 
we ensure that no emissions or pollutants from water, air, or other fluids are discharged into the 
environment, thereby safeguarding the health and well-being of the natural surroundings. Any 
light fumes emitted are well within the CPCB/SPCB limits for air emissions and do not fall under the 
category of GHG emissions.
•	
In compliance with environmental standards, we are committed to conserving and protecting 
natural resources while actively working to reduce pollution. We prioritize environmental safety and 
implement stringent pollution control measures as stipulated by environmental regulations.

10.	Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the 
strategy adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your 
products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.  
Our company adheres rigorously to CPCB/SPCB approved standards for air pollutants, effluent quality, 
discharge protocols, and the management of solid and hazardous waste. We strictly comply with all 
relevant environmental regulations and guidelines during waste disposal. Our waste management 
strategy focuses on three core areas: waste reduction through streamlined manufacturing processes and 
responsible production practices, recycling and reuse initiatives to maximize resource efficiency, and 
conscientious waste disposal methods.
We prioritize source reduction by optimizing our manufacturing processes to minimize material waste 
and reduce the generation of hazardous and non-hazardous substances. Our commitment extends to 
promoting recycling and reuse wherever feasible, ensuring that recyclable materials are segregated and 
sent to appropriate recycling facilities. Scrap and waste raw materials from our manufacturing operations 
are transported to specialized recycling plants rather than being recycled onsite.
Additionally, we have implemented a comprehensive approach to minimize the use of hazardous and toxic 
chemicals in our products and processes. This includes stringent hazardous waste management practices, 
controlled application of hazardous chemicals, and ongoing employee training programs. Furthermore, 
we are progressively encouraging our suppliers and vendors to adopt sustainable procurement practices, 
such as minimizing packaging and enhancing recycling capabilities when necessary.

No Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) were undertaken in the financial year 2023-24. This is 
because our projects during this period did not fall under the categories that require an EIA according to 
applicable environmental regulations. The scope and nature of our projects were such that they did not 
meet the criteria necessitating formal environmental assessments. As a result, EIAs were not required 
for any of our initiatives this year.

Yes, data protection is increasingly crucial for companies of all sizes and industries. A robust data 
protection strategy is essential for safeguarding digital resources and information from both internal and 
external threats. We have implemented a comprehensive IT security system that complies with legislative 
requirements and follows industry best practices.
	
Our organization is equipped with a high-standard IT infrastructure, supported by regular preventive 
and corrective maintenance. Our IT policy aims to establish guidelines and recommendations for the 
secure, efficient, and optimal use of our IT assets. This policy is designed to protect the organization's 
network and resources from threats such as viruses, malware, spyware, and unauthorized access. We 
utilize firewalls, anti-virus and anti-spam software, AV definitions, intrusion prevention systems (IPS), 
and web filtering to defend against potential cyber threats.
	
Our IT department is responsible for managing and developing an infrastructure that ensures the secure 
and continuous distribution of information within the organization and to external partners via the 
Internet. As part of this framework, we have implemented procedures to scan our data and information 
to prevent the spread of viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful executable objects. Emails 
identified as containing viruses, worms, Trojan horses, or other executable threats are not delivered to 
users. If an email cannot be sanitized, it is removed from the delivery system and assessed by our network 
and security administrator.
