1
Climate Change and 
Energy Management
Opportunity
The emergence of virtual and hybrid 
working models due to climate change 
has emphasized the necessity for NLSL’s 
online training modules. As we navigate 
the shift towards virtual and hybrid work 
setups, climate change presents a significant 
opportunity for our business.
Positive
2
Talent Attraction and 
Development
Opportunity
As a talent development corporation, it 
is crucial for us at NLSL to prioritize the 
development of our own human capital. We 
have established a robust learning culture 
within the organization.
Additionally, we prioritize and consistently 
invest in cultivating a diverse group of 
leaders. Our company offers executive 
development programs tailored to every 
level, 
including 
individual 
contributors, 
managers, and leaders.
We utilize technological solutions to enhance 
the employee experience. For instance, we 
are currently implementing Success Factors, 
employing an AI BOT for engagement 
surveys, and utilizing an online portal for 
wellness initiatives.
Positive
3
Data Privacy and 
Cyber Security
Risk
There are several potential risks associated 
with cyber threats, including malware attacks, 
social engineering attacks, and software 
supply chain attacks. These risks pose a 
significant threat to the organization as they 
can result in the theft of sensitive customer 
data. This not only jeopardizes data privacy 
but also poses a reputational risk to the 
organization.
NLSL implements various security 
measures such as Segregation of Duties 
(SOD), Multi-Factor Authentication 
(MFA), disk encryption, and USB 
disablement to safeguard against IT 
risks and maintain data privacy. Our 
robust cyber security and data privacy 
policy is designed to promptly address 
threats and effectively manage data, 
mitigating any potential risks stemming 
from cyber security and data privacy 
concerns.
Negative
4
Artificial Intelligence
Risk & 
Opportunity
Risk exists in the learning content practice 
as customers may opt to use Gen AI for 
content creation. However, customers may 
alternatively opt to invest in more effective 
training at levels 2 and 3.
We have incorporated automation, bots, 
and RPAs into our Learning administration 
processes. While AI won’t revolutionize our 
offerings, it does enable us to introduce 
some new products. 
The risk is low for Learning Delivery as 
instructors continue to offer unique value 
towards building proficiency.
Our strategy for future is centered 
around a strong focus on highly 
AI-enabled solutions. We also plan 
to invest significantly in FY25 to 
strengthen our AI capabilities, for 
driving 
internal 
efficiencies 
and 
customer deliverables.

5
Employee Health and 
Safety
Opportunity
Poor work environments and unsafe practices 
can deter employee retention and discourage 
workplace efficiency or productivity. Lost time 
injuries create loss of productivity and mental 
dissatisfaction in employees. Given the 
COVID-19 pandemic, employee demands 
have shifted to mental and emotional 
wellness rather than only that of physical. 
Employee well-being has been an important 
focus area for NLSL. When COVID first 
impacted us, we already had in place a 
wellness portal called Round Glass which 
was used for various health and wellness 
programs. We also had a panel of experts 
to take care of mental wellness. During the 
COVID period, we took care of the complete 
expenses related to treatment for employees 
and for their dependents. We also extended 
monthly monetary support, and educational 
support to the children of bereaved families. 
Our online wellness portal has more than 
50% of employees participating in webinars 
on areas related to health and wellbeing. 
We also drive health and wellness initiatives 
through a tie up with Cultfit and provide 
free sponsorship of membership to our 
employees. We take continuous feedback 
from NIITians through engagement surveys 
and feedback to design and incorporate 
newer initiatives in the area of wellbeing.
Positive
6
Business Ethics 
and Corporate 
Governance
Opportunity
Business ethics are cornerstones of 
ensuring transparent and sustainable 
corporate 
governance 
frameworks. 
Upholding policies such as code of 
conduct and anti-bribery & corruption 
and 
good-Business 
ethics 
are 
cornerstones of ensuring transparent 
and sustainable corporate governance 
frameworks. Upholding policies such 
as code of conduct and anti-bribery 
& corruption and good-governance 
measures 
to 
effectively 
implement 
stringent 
actions, 
among 
others 
tantamount to strong business ethics. 
When such business ethics are not 
complied with it often leads to significant 
reputational damage.
NLSL has a Code of Conduct in place 
to ensure compliance with standards 
of 
business 
practices 
and 
legal 
requirements for all its employees and 
workers. We also have comprehensive 
anti-bribery and anti-corruption policy 
and measures to ensure compliance and 
management of risks. Policies such as 
whistleblower, related party transactions, 
etc. are also existent and material to 
business.

Customer 
Concentration
Risk & 
Opportunity 
The organization functions in multiple 
enterprise sectors and is mostly focused 
on Fortune 1000 organizations and 500 
global organization around the world. 
The organization sets into its customer 
training and upskilling in an integral 
manner, which results in fewer customers 
having a large share or contribution 
towards revenue. Usually, the customer 
maturity process is long-term for the 
business.
NLSL has grown to earn the 
trust of many Fortune 1000 and 
Global 500 companies in over 63 
countries. Trusted by the world’s 
leading companies, NLSL provides 
high-impact managed learning 
solutions that weave together the 
best of learning theory, technology, 
operations, and services to enable 
a thriving workforce.
The risk of failure of these 
customers is low and there is a 
steep entry barrier.
More and more organizations are 
engaging providers such as NLSL 
for outsourcing; hence there are 
significant opportunities in the 
market. Currently the organization 
has a wide customer base offering 
varied services with increasing 
revenue share.
Negative
8
Supply chain 
Management
Opportunity
Supply 
chain 
management 
affects 
product and service quality, delivery, 
costs, 
customer 
experience 
and 
ultimately, 
profitability. 
Increased 
supply chain disruptions at the wake of 
geopolitical transitions, and crises such 
as the pandemic result in loss of business 
continuity. Lack of inclusive supply chains 
creates vacuum at the time of a crises 
and a robust supply chain includes local 
sourcing, also boosting local economies 
and disadvantaged communities.
The organization operation depends 
significantly on value chain partner, and 
it maintains a very wide base of such 
partners globally with ability to sources 
at very short interval to meet customer 
demands. 
The 
value 
proposition 
to its enterprise customers that the 
organization provides is the ability to 
meet certain surges of demand while, on 
the other hand, not requiring customers 
to have any fixed commitment.
Positive
	
Note: While the material Issues are identify, the organization is undergoing the details assessment of prioritization for 
driving its long term sustainability goals.

Leadership Indicators
1.	
Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and 
social topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.
	
There are multiple sub committees of the board (CSR committee, risk management, audit committee, shareholder 
governance, nomination and remuneration committee), where the management provides updates on matters like 
environmental changes, environmental risk, and other topics having a significant impact like people policy, etc. The 
respective business leadership team provides quarterly inputs on performance and yearly perspective planning for three 
years with budgets for the next year to the board members as per schedule. External professionals like statutory auditors, 
cost auditors, secretarial auditors, and other professional experts on matters like tax and M&A are regularly invited to 
submit their reports either to subcommittees or to the board directly. In fact, the NLSL Board conducts townhall meetings 
for its employees as the first stakeholders to be informed post the board’s quarterly meeting to ensure a conducive 
environment to work in. Fire-side chats are also conducted for employees to voice their feedback directly to the NLSL 
Managing Director as well as CEO. There is robust customer feedback mechanisms from individual beneficiary to 
customer leadership team. The voice of the customers are discussed at the board meetings and future product and 
marketing strategies are derived accordingly.
2. 
Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, 
and social topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders 
on these topics were incorporated into policies and activities of the entity.
	
Yes, The inputs received from board members, shareholders in the AGM, employee suggestions, and customer inputs 
through surveys are duly addressed with a specific action plan and timeline, which are monitored and then reported 
back to the respective stakeholders. 
	
Based on employee feedback Leave policy is enhanced from 20 days to 32 days per year. This change is designed to 
support everyone’s well-being and work life balance, giving the flexibility and time to relax, recharge and focus on what 
matters most.
	
Based on customer input the organization has implemented SCC clauses to ensure high level of data privacy to be 
maintained. Post engagement with customers the organization has obtained bronze level EcoVadis certificate.
3.	
Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/ 
marginalized stakeholder groups.
	
NLSL is an equal opportunity organization, and each employee has equal rights. The concerns of our stakeholder 
groups are heard with utmost sensitivity, and we have a transparent process for raising their concerns independently 
through human resources. HR also ensures anonymity and keeps the complainant’s information confidential from any 
and every other employee of our organization. During community programs, our point of contact creates a two-way 
and conducive communication pathway, and our grievance redressal policy also helps take the necessary recourse for 
concerns of stakeholder groups. 
	
The NIIT Foundation organizes job fairs, invites industry experts for student felicitation, and conducts door-to-door 
mobilization activities for encouraging marginalized and vulnerable communities to persevere in education.

Yes.
5.	
Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues.
	
NLSL is committed to providing a fair, safe and productive work environment where grievances, if any, are dealt

could be effectively addressed. A grievance may be about an act, omission, situation, or decision that the NIITian feels 
is unfair, discriminatory, or unjustified. 
	
NIITians are encouraged to come forward with their grievances in the knowledge that the organization will take 
appropriate action to address those grievances. This can be done in an informal way by verbally communicating 
the issue to the Manager or HR and then getting it addressed along with a member from the Grievance Redressal 
Committee (GRC). The other option is to submit the complaint in writing to either Manager/Business HR or posting 
at email id GrievanceCell@niitmts.com which is accessible by an authorized representative from the Leadership team 
of HR. Further to provide better confidentiality and independence an email ID CPO@niitmts.com is available which is 
directly accessed by the CHRO of the company. 
	
An option is also available to post an Anonymous message on the Amber portal (AI powered HR Engagement portal). 
A link called as ‘Anonymous Bat’ is shared with the INIITian’s post completion of their feedback in Amber in order to 
message directly to CEO and CHRO without sharing the identity.
