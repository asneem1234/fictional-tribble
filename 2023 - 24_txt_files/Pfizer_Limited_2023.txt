These priority areas are aligned with our Parent Company’s Blueprint Strategy and are further incorporated into 
its Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process. These six areas are consistent with our Values and our patient-
centered purpose.

1.
Climate Change
Risk 
The 
Company 
acknowledges 
the 
potential risks associated 
with climate change, such 
as heightened negative 
effects on human health; 
increasing frequency of 
severe 
weather 
events 
impacting 
communities, 
personnel and operations; 
and 
potential 
reduced 
access 
to 
essential 
medicines and vaccines 
due 
to 
value 
chain 
disruptions. 
1.	 The 
Company, 
through 
its 
parent 
company, 
Pfizer 
Inc., 
aims 
to 
continue 
its-near-
term commitment to reduce 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 
by 
46% 
compared 
to 
2019 
baseline, aligned with a 1.50C 
trajectory. Pfizer Inc. also aims 
to reduce GHG emissions by 
working to achieve the voluntary 
Net Zero Standard by 2040, 10 
years earlier than the timeline 
prescribed in the standard. We 
aim to decrease GHG emissions 
by reducing the energy demand 
of our operations, transitioning 
away from fossil fuels, sourcing 
renewable 
electricity, 
and 
engaging suppliers to catalyze 
equivalent action. 
2.	 Pfizer Limited has been investing 
in onsite solar projects at its Goa 
manufacturing facility. The site 
generated 2060 MWH Green 
Electricity in the financial year 
2023-24 out of which 1502 MWH 
electrical energy was consumed 
in manufacturing process and 
558 MWH was exported back to 
National Grid.
Positive: 
The Company’s focus 
on its climate change-
related 
goals 
helps 
enable it to reduce 
environmental 
risks 
and create a resilient 
business. 
Through 
replacing our capital 
assets 
to 
become 
more efficient and use 
alternative fuel sources, 
Pfizer could increase 
resilience 
to 
volatile 
fuel and energy prices 
resulting 
from 
the 
low-carbon 
transition 
and increase returns 
on investment in low-
emissions technology. 
2.
Product Quality 
and Safety
Risk & 
Opportunity
Our commitment to health 
& safety allows us to cater 
excellence through our 
products. The safety of our 
customers and patients is 
of the utmost importance. 
This has a critical impact 
on our relationships with 
stakeholders.
Failure 
to 
maintain 
product 
quality 
and 
product safety may have 
an adverse impact on 
the 
well-being 
of 
the 
patients, 
reputation 
of 
the Company, and may 
expose the Company to 
litigation.
Product quality and safety are 
paramount to the Company and the 
Company’s approach to mitigate 
risks includes the following:
1.	 The Quality Management System 
(“QMS”) of the Company is 
based on industry-recognized 
quality management principles 
and is designed and built to 
adhere to applicable standards 
and 
requirements 
of 
health 
authorities and best practices.
2.	 The Company provides training 
to employees in product safety 
and quality.
3.	 The 
grievance 
redressal 
mechanism of the Company 
enables complaints to be raised 
relating to product quality in a 
timely manner.
Positive: 
Emphasis 
on quality and safety 
allows 
us 
to 
build 
strong 
and 
lasting 
relationships with our 
stakeholders. 
This 
furthers our business 
objectives and allows 
for continued financial 
growth.
Negative: 
Failure 
to 
maintain 
high 
quality 
in 
products 
could 
adversely 
impact patient health, 
reputational 
damage, 
financial 
liability, 
product 
recalls 
and 
shortages.

Company 
continually

Business Ethics
Risk 
& 
Opportunity
Values-based 
decision-
making 
promotes 
accountability and helps 
ensure 
that 
integrity, 
quality, safety, and ethics 
are foundational to all we 
do.
Our Code of Conduct (the Blue Book) 
and related policies, procedures, 
and training are designed to support 
compliance and adherence to our 
Values - Courage, Excellence, Equity, 
and Joy. 
Policies 
governing 
colleague 
interactions 
with 
healthcare 
organizations, physicians, patients, 
and 
other 
stakeholders 
are 
contained in the Blue Book.
To ensure that business ethics 
is integrated into our business, 
we have in place strong policies 
such as our Code of Conduct 
and Ethics Policy. Any violations 
of the same can be addressed 
through our Whistleblower Policy/
Vigil 
Mechanism. 
Additionally, 
Pfizer’s My Anti-Corruption Policy 
and Procedures (“MAPP”) outline 
Pfizer’s enterprise-wide approach to 
preventing bribery and corruption.
Positive:

we demonstrate our 
continued commitment 
to living our Values and 
earning the trust of 
the patients we serve 
and 
to 
fully 
realize 
Pfizer’s 
Purpose—
Breakthroughs 
That 
Change Patients’ Lives.
Negative: 
Violations 
of

and

Is there a mechanism available to receive and redress grievances for the following categories of employees

Permanent Workers 
Yes.
Courage is a core value, and at Pfizer, we promote a speak up environment, 
including our Open Door (whistleblower) policy  and strict anti-retaliation 
policies, which require reporting misconduct and encourage raising 
concerns about any issues. Retaliation against anyone who seeks 
advice, raises a concern, reports misconduct, or provides information 
in an investigation is strictly prohibited. The Company takes all policy 
concerns seriously and, to the extent violations of policy are identified, 
takes appropriate disciplinary action and corrective actions, including 
potential termination. We measure colleague comfort and awareness 
about raising concerns, including awareness of our whistleblower policy 
through an employee survey, and the results are used to focus leadership 
communications, training, and other proactive efforts. 
We provide multiple channels for asking questions and raising potential 
compliance concerns, including anonymous reporting options where 
permitted by local law, and keep matters as confidential as possible. 
The avenues for raising concerns are listed in the Blue Book and on our 
website www.pfizerltd.co.in, both of which are publicly available. Every 
employee, irrespective of hierarchy, has access to the Employee Relations 
Investigations Group, Compliance and Legal Divisions, People Experience 
Division of the Company and in appropriate and exceptional cases, 
concerns may be raised directly to the Chairman of the Audit Committee 
of the Company. In addition, our Ombuds Office is an available resource to 
support colleagues with information and guidance to help them address 
work-related issues.

assess environment, health, safety (EHS), and sustainability performance, including labour and human rights reviews. 
When assessing whether a supplier is high-risk, we consider the supplier’s geography, industry, and other proprietary 
and public domain information.  The risk-based assessment process results in a supplier risk score. Suppliers that are 
determined to have an elevated risk, e.g., EHS and labour and human rights risks, are subject to a governance process 
which may result in the supplier being required by Pfizer to develop corrective actions to improve their operations 
and procedures and/or mitigate identified risks. If the supplier does not comply with the agreed corrective actions, 
Pfizer may seek an alternative supplier. Additionally, Pfizer Limited has strong internal processes and checks to help 
ensure compliance on human rights and related topics.
