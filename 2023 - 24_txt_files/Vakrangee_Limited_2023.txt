Our business model is built on sustainability, aimed at fostering 
financial, social, and digital inclusion for Indians. Through our 
extensive network of outlets, we are advancing financial, digital, and 
social inclusion in rural India. Every aspect of our business and the 
products and services we offer are designed with sustainability in 
mind.
Our Kendra outlets serve as one-stop shops, delivering essential 
services to rural citizens, including banking services, ATMs, healthcare, 
and online shopping.
Our capital expenditure primarily supports the acquisition of 
environmentally friendly ATM machines. These machines are 
paperless, with transaction acknowledgments sent via SMS, in line 
with our 'Go Green' initiatives. We are committed to minimizing paper 
usage through prevention, reduction, recycling, and reuse to mitigate 
environmental impacts.
To further enhance our environmental efforts, we are integrating 
energy efficiencies into our facilities by increasing the use of 
renewable energy sources, such as solar power. Currently, 16% of our 
energy consumption comes from solar power. We are also working 
on expanding our use of renewable energy through power purchase 
agreements with private renewable energy suppliers.
Our commitment to green infrastructure includes adopting cleaner 
technologies, green IT practices, and IT-enabled operational 
efficiencies. We also emphasize sustainable procurement through our 
Green Procurement Policy, prioritizing EPEAT-certified products to

exposure of community members to hazardous and non-hazardous waste.
	
We have always been a Responsible and Socially Conscious Company. Our business strategy has been mapped with 
the sustainability initiatives along with the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals. We have re-affirmed our
