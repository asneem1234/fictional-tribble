Does the entity have an anti-corruption or anti-bribery policy? If yes, provide details in brief and if available, provide a web-link 
to the policy.
 
Yes, the policy covers the Company. To ensure transparency and integrity, GRSE has adopted Integrity Pact with all vendors / suppliers / 
contractors’ / service providers for all Orders / Contracts of value ` 200 lakh and above. Integrity Pact enables the bidders to raise any issues 
with respect to high value tenders floated from time to time with the Independent External Monitor (IEM). IEMs are appointed by the Central 
Vigilance Commission (CVC) to oversee implementation of the said Integrity Pact. The pact essentially envisages an agreement between 
the prospective vendors / bidders and the Principal (GRSE), committing the Persons / officials of both sides, not to resort to any corrupt 
practices in any aspect / stage of the contract. Only those vendors/ bidders, who commit themselves to such a Pact with the Principal, would 
be considered competent to participate in the bidding process. Integrity Pact, in respect of a particular contract, would be operative from 
the stage of invitation of bids till the final completion of the contract. Any violation of the same would entail disqualification of the bidders 
and exclusion from future business dealings. Further, all the policies relating to ethics, bribery and corruption are “inclusive” and cover the 
Company as well as its employees and all other external stakeholders.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details.
 
Yes. The Company addresses issues such as climate change and global warming through energy conservation measures and energy 
substitution. There is a thrust to use renewable energy resources such as solar power for captive consumption. The Company, so far has 
installed a total 2250 KWP i.e. 2.25 MW Rooftop solar power plant at Main, FOJ & RBD Units. During the year, total generation power from 
the above 2.25 MW Unit was 17,53,141 KWh out of which 74,364 KWh injected to CESC grid. Further this facility helps reduction in emission 
of greenhouse gas by about 14,90,169.85 Kg {KWh x 0.85 (i.e Emission factor) = Kg of Co2}

10. Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your 
company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage 
such wastes.
 
Different production units have taken various measures towards environment protection and conservation, governed by various acts and 
rules like the Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management and Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2016, Solid Waste Management Rules, 
2016, Air Prevention and Control of Pollution Act (1981), Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, Water Act 1974 (Prevention and Control 
of Pollution), etc. All Units are ISO 14001 certified and comply with the rules prescribed by respective State Pollution Control Boards. All 
emissions and waste generation are monitored as prescribed by the Pollution Control Boards.
 
In our manufacturing activity, reduction of waste generation is taken as a very important activity and our nesting plan for cutting of metal 
sheet is made in such a way to take care of this aspect. Across GRSE, solid wastes/scraps having resale value were collected, segregated, 
stored and sold.
 
Hazardous wastes generated at units are disposed as per the regulatory requirement. 
 
The Company, as part of its operations, generates e-waste from old electrical and electronics systems, computer systems (IT) and communication 
systems, which needs to be disposed after their life expiry or damage. The e-waste generated and collected is stored in designated areas 
(under cover) and auctioned through with MSTC Limited for disposal through authorized dismantlers/recyclers/refurbishers.
