5.	
Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan? Give details in 100 words/ web 
link. 
	
Business continuity risk is a key risk for organizations like ours for successfully running our operations. 
We are working on putting in an effective Business Continuity Plan (BCP) to ensure the maintenance or 
recovery of operations, including service delivery to our customer, when confronted with adverse events such 
as a disruption or failure of our systems or operations in the event of a Fire, major earthquake, weather 
event, cyber-attack, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event which could cause delays in completing 
sales, providing services, or performing other mission-critical functions. A significant portion of our research 
and development activities, and certain other critical business operations are located in Noida, India (our 
corporate headquarters) which is adjacent to the national capital of India, Delhi. Here it may be worthwhile 
to mention that, according to a seismic zoning map issued by the Bureau of Indian Standards and quoted 
in the National Disaster Management (NDM) report, Delhi belongs to Zone IV, a severe intensity seismic 
zone. Any catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or 
information technology systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations.
	
To counter this risk, we have setup an Online disaster recovery site to replicate our IPR (Source code) in 
different seismic zone and backup copy on tape. In addition to this we are also having Disaster Recovery setup 
for few customers in different seismic zone who has agreement with Nucleus for business continuity and 
uninterrupted support though this facility is not in place for all the customers. The Company is continuously 
investing in security of its operations & processes and evaluating the risks on periodic basis. We are an ISO/IEC 
Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report  179 
Annual Report 2023-24
27001:2022 (ISMS) certified organization, which reflects our focus and commitment to increase adherence to 
secure practices. More so for business continuity, the growth of any product business is directly linked to the 
install base and the feedback of existing customers. These two factors are key for the purchase decisions of 
prospective customers.
	
Hence a large negative impact on Company’s reputation can be a big setback. The Company enjoys is well 
recognized to offer great business values to our customers enabled by our business platforms. 
	
On the security front, strict procedures are in place to control the level of access to Data centers and other 
sensitive areas. Access to the premises is controlled through Biometric access control systems and proximity 
cards. The Company has invested significantly in a state-of-the-art network infrastructure for managing 
its operations and for establishing high-speed redundant links to overseas destinations. Additionally, the 
Internet filtering tools prevent any type of non-business usage over Internet within office and outside office. 
	
We have implemented Data loss prevention on mail gateway and laptops to safeguard the company IPR.
