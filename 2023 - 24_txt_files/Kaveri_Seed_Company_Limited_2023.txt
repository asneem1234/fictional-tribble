(a)	
Plastics
	
(including packaging)
The company has implemented several systems to promote recycling and reduce waste generation. 
For example, it recycles chemical wash water used in seed treatment, effectively addressing 
hazardous waste disposal challenges. Additionally, the maize shanks produced during dry cob shelling 
are repurposed in the heat generation process, achieving the critical temperature needed for drying 
harvested wet cobs while minimizing energy requirements. The company also recycles used chemical 
containers to minimize chemical waste and protect the environment. Furthermore, the cotton delinking 
process utilizes dilute sulphuric acid, which is reused multiple times to minimize waste generation and
