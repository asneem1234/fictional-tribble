Reporting (‘BRSR’)

aiming to promote transparency and accountability.)

1.
Green building
O
Green buildings are more efficient 
than traditional buildings and may 
lower operating costs, increase 
revenues, and reduce exposure 
to the physical and transition risks 
presented by climate change. 
These factors may increase the 
valuation 
of 
green 
buildings, 
making 
them 
stronger 
credit 
assets and better collateral. With 
investors and consumers focus 
leaning towards green building, 
it 
can 
help 
improve 
market 
competitiveness.
N.A.
Positive
2.
Water 
Management
R
Water serves as an indispensable 
resource 
essential 
across 
construction 
stages. 
Moreover, 
it finds application in various 
administrative 
and 
business 
activities, 
exerting 
a 
direct 
influence on local water resource 
quality and quantity. Excessive 
withdrawal can deplete local water 
sources, 
harming 
ecosystems 
and aggravating water scarcity 
issues. Compliance with water 
usage regulations is essential to 
avoid fines and delays in project 
completion.
We 
have 
in 
place 
systems and processes 
to 
track, 
measure, 
manage and monitor 
water 
used 
for 
the 
Company’s operations.
Negative
3.
Waste 
management
R
Our construction and business 
activities 
yield 
a 
substantial 
volume of waste, making effective 
waste 
management 
a 
critical 
concern. 
Waste 
management 
involves 
treatment, 
handling, 
storage, disposal and regulatory 
compliance of waste.
We have systems and 
processes 
to 
track, 
measure, 
manage 
and 
monitor 
waste 
generated 
due 
to 
operations 
and 
also 
disposed by us.

4.
Carbon 
emissions 
and energy 
management
R
The 
construction 
industry 
is 
a 
significant 
contributor 
to 
carbon 
emissions 
and 
energy 
consumption, primarily through 
the 
operation 
of 
machinery, 
transportation of materials, and 
energy-intensive 
construction 
processes. Regulatory frameworks 
are increasingly focusing on carbon 
emissions and energy efficiency 
standards, with stricter regulations 
being implemented to mitigate 
climate 
change 
and 
reduce 
environmental footprint. Failure to 
comply with these regulations can 
result in legal liabilities, fines, and 
reputational damage, significantly 
impacting the company’s bottom 
line and its ability to secure future 
projects. Prioritizing sustainability 
practices 
can 
open 
up 
new 
business 
opportunities, 
attract 
environmentally-conscious clients, 
and position the company as 
a responsible corporate citizen 
committed 
to 
mitigating 
its 
environmental impact.
We have taken steps 
to 
promote 
energy 
efficiency by installing 
solar 
panels, 
utilizing 
LED lights and other 
measures in our office.
Negative
5.
Biodiversity 
conservation 
and 
restoration
O
By 
embracing 
biodiversity 
as 
one of the important aspects 
of the business, the Company 
can 
secure 
long-term 
value. 
Biodiverse ecosystems contribute 
to property resilience, enhance 
natural 
beauty, 
and 
attract 
environmentally conscious buyers 
and tenants. Being associated 
with 
conservation 
efforts 
can 
positively impact public perception 
and stakeholder trust.

Health and 
Safety
R
The health and safety of on-
site staff is a significant risk for 
the 
construction 
sector 
and 
the 
Company. 
The 
workforce 
faces 
potential 
hazards 
such 
as construction site accidents, 
exposure to hazardous materials, 
fire hazards, etc.
We prioritize health and 
safety 
by 
effectively 
implementing our health 
and safety policy and 
management 
system, 
thereby managing and 
mitigating risks related 
to health and safety.
Negative.
8.
Human rights 
and Labor 
Management
R
Operations in the real estate 
sector 
may 
cause 
significant 
human rights risks, particularly 
concerning land acquisition and 
resettlement, as well as labor 
rights. Real estate development 
projects often entail acquiring 
land, potentially displacing local 
communities and affecting their 
access to land, resources, and 
livelihoods. Additionally, real estate 
activities rely on labor, including 
construction workers and property 
managers, who are at the risk of 
exploitation, substandard working 
conditions, 
discrimination 
or 
insufficient compensation.
We proactively manage 
human rights and labor 
management risks by 
implementing 
robust 
policies, comprehensive 
management systems, 
and regular monitoring 
to ensure compliance 
and protect the rights 
and well-being of our 
workforce.
Negative.
9.
Brand 
Management
O
An effective branding strategy and 
brand positioning are essential for 
cultivating customer commitment 
and preference. By strategically 
defining 
brand 
identity 
and 
differentiating 
offerings 
from 
competitors, the Company can 
build strong connections with its 
existing and potential customers. 
This fosters loyalty and ensures 
that the company’s brand stands 
out in the marketplace, driving 
long-term success and growth for 
the business.

Due to growing reliance of real 
estate 
sector 
on 
technology 
and data driven solution and 
involvement of significant amount 
of personal and financial data in the 
transactions, addressing privacy 
and data security proactively, can
