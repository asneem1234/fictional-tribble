SEGMENT
RISK
MITIGATION
1.	Regulatory 
Compliance
Failure to comply with rapidly changing 
regulatory 
requirements 
can 
result 
in 
adverse impact for the Company and erode 
stakeholders’ trust. Evolving environmental 
and social regulations present a risk of 
potential non-compliance which, if not met, 
can result in fines, penalties and adverse 
impact on brand reputation.
Equinox 
India 
Developments 
Limited 
(EMBDL) is committed to promote a culture of 
compliance within the organization supported 
by a zero-tolerance policy and has a robust set 
of environmental, social and governance related 
policies in place. At EMBDL, compliance related 
risks are reviewed at regular intervals and 
procedures and practices constantly evolve to 
fulfil compliance requirements based on extant 
rulings and changing market conditions.
2.	Physical 
Impacts 
of Climate 
Change
Increased severity of extreme weather events 
including natural disasters, rising mean 
temperatures and sea levels pose a risk of 
damage to real estate portfolio. It can result in 
adverse impacts in future in the form of costs 
to repair and replace damaged assets in 
case of any natural disasters and subsequent 
property downtime.
As part of its mitigation strategy, Equinox India 
Developments Limited maps physical risks for 
its current portfolio and future development 
projects, followed by incorporation of physical 
adaptation and mitigation measures for assets 
that are identified at risk.
All our buildings are designed for a seismic zone 
higher than the zone of the area they are built in, 
to ensure greater resilience in an earthquake. 
Additionally, rainwater harvesting wells have 
been built for water conservation and to prevent 
flooding at site.
3.	Health and 
Safety
Equinox India Developments Limited, majorly 
at Group Level, is engaged in construction of 
buildings and management of a significant 
portfolio of real estate assets. Owing to the 
nature of the operations, health and safety 
is identified as a potential risk for business. 
As productivity can be adversely affected or 
significantly improved based on Occupational 
Health and Safety (OHS) performance, 
ensuring the safety of its employees, 
contractors 
and 
the 
local 
communities 
surrounding project sites is its top-most 
priority. 
Health and safety are one of the key priorities for 
the Company. The Company has mandated to 
follow all the measures to strengthen health and 
safety systems and processes for preventing 
any safety incidents.

related hazards and outlines the mechanism for recording and investigating an incident, recommending corrective 
and preventive actions and to communicate the lessons learned to prevent recurrence of similar incidents. For 
undertaking corrective and preventive actions, standard hierarchy of controls is followed to bring the hazard at ‘As 
Low As Reasonably Practicable’ (ALARP) level.
