Financial Year 2022-23
During the year, 5 of the Company’s vessels were retrofitted with Mewis Duct, a device which improves the flow of water on to propeller and thus its 
efficiency. It also helps in reduction of underwater noise.
During the year, the Company replaced traditional lighting such as fluorescent, halogen and incandescent lights onboard its vessels with energy 
efficient LED lights on 5 vessels.
For a typical Bulk Carrier or Tanker, loss of energy through hull resistance is around 25-30% and this increases with growth of hull roughness due to bio-
fouling. To minimize growth of bio-fouling, the Company has applied superior anti-fouling coatings on 04 vessels during their respective dry dockings. 
Hull cleaning was carried out in 28 ships and propeller polishing on 34 ships.
Research & Development – 
The trials with sustainable biofuel blended VLSFO completed successfully in this fiscal and a complete report from IRS Class was submitted to Flag 
administration.
Financial Year 2023-24
During the year, 01 of the Company’s vessel was retrofitted with Mewis Duct, a device which improves the flow of water on to propeller and thus its

02 LR1 tankers were fitted with redesigned propellers which are more efficient than the existing ones.
During the year, the Company replaced traditional lighting such as fluorescent, halogen and incandescent lights onboard its vessels with energy 
efficient LED lights on 8 vessels.
For a typical Bulk Carrier or Tanker, loss of energy through hull resistance is around 25-30% and this increases with growth of hull roughness due to bio-
fouling. To minimize growth of bio-fouling, the Company has applied superior anti-fouling coatings on 08 vessels during their respective dry dockings. 
Hull cleaning was carried out in 29 ships and propeller polishing on 36 ships.
Research & Development –
•	We carried out trails with an in-transit hull cleaning robotic equipment on two of our vessels.
•	Also conducting a trial with an ultrasonic equipment for protection of propeller from biofouling on one of our vessels.
2.	
a. Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing?
The Company is into a business of marine transportation of bulk commodities which does not involve sourcing of raw materials as an input 
for manufacturing any end product. Most of the Company’s supplies to vessels are finished products, for example engine spares which are 
procured from maker or licensee, consumables from reputed oil majors, paint and chemical from manufacturers, general stores from ship 
chandlers who procure multiple line items from the market, consolidate and deliver them on board. So, in essence, the Company does not 
procure any raw material as input to our business activities. However, the Company looks for following criteria while selecting its vendor for a 
prospective business –
1)	
Sourcing from reputable suppliers known in the industry.
2)	
Vendors are maintaining registration under local/ regional laws.
3)	
Vendors are complying to National and International applicable legislations.
4)	
Vendors are maintaining management systems under ISO 9001 and 14001 or any other equivalent systems wherever applicable.
5)	
Suppliers are requested to meet following Company requirements additionally:
a)	
In accordance with SOLAS Chapter 11-1/ Reg 3-5 supplies of materials which contain asbestos are prohibited on all ships and 
“asbestos free declaration” must be provided with every supply made to the vessel.
b)	
The seller shall guarantee that no hazardous material identified under MEPC269(68) and EUSRR have been used in the supplies.
c)	
The seller shall complete and provide Appendix A1: Supplier’s Declaration of conformity and Appendix A2: Material Declaration form 
along with the items and other technical documentation as per the standard format provided under business associates on www.
greatship.com

The Company is into a business of marine transportation of bulk commodities and do not manufacture any product for sale. However, waste 
generated on board during normal operation of ship are handled as per vessel specific garbage management plan and landed ashore to 
approved reception facilities for further processing. Besides last financial year, we supplied 16 more vessels with shredder to improve the 
management of wastes onboard, taking the total figure to 32 ships. For the e-waste generated at shore offices, the Company has tied up with 
an approved local recycler. The Company tries to re-use the old laptops as far as possible before opting for disposal to recycler.

Emissions
The Company abides by the existing regulations and guidelines set by the IMO regarding climate 
change mitigation and air pollution. It supports their revised climate strategy towards 2050, which 
aims to reduce CO2 emissions per transport work, as an average across international shipping, 
by at least 40% by 2030, pursuing efforts towards total GHG emission reduction by 70% by 2040, 
compared to 2008 levels; and to achieve net zero by 2050 compared to 2008 levels.
The Company complies with the International Maritime Organization (IMO) - MARPOL Convention 
Annex VI which specifically addresses the prevention of air pollution from ocean-going ships. This 
MARPOL Convention seeks to control airborne emissions from ships including Sulphur oxides 
(SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx), ozone depleting substances (ODS), volatile organic compounds (VOC) 
and shipboard incineration. To reduce emissions, the Company has implemented following:
•	In order to improve air quality and protect the environment, from 1 January 2020, the IMO 
limit for sulphur in fuel oil used by ships operating outside of emission control areas (“ECAs”) 
was reduced from 3.50% to 0.50%. This dramatic reduction in SOx emitted from ships will 
provide significant health and environmental benefits around the world, particularly for coastal 
populations and those living near ports. The Company has reduced the Sulphur oxide (SOx) 
emissions by following a mixed strategy of using low Sulphur fuel and installation of exhaust gas 
cleaning systems (EGCS) to comply with the above IMO regulation.
•	The Company’s applicable vessels are in compliance with NOx emission requirements as per 
MAPROL Annex VI and maintains NOx technical file.
•	Since 2014, the Company has a dedicated department responsible for vessel performance 
management. They helped in enhancing fuel efficiency of vessels through advising on retro 
fitment of energy saving devices and operational measures. The Company’s list of emission 
reduction measures includes installation of Redesigned Propellers, Mewis duct, Propeller Boss 
Cap fins (PBCF), ECO Cap, LED lighting, use of low friction hull coatings and onboard sensors 
driven data collection systems in order to enable fuel consumption optimization in real time on 
selected vessels.
•	Over the years, the Company has been consistently following fleet renewal program, selling 
some of our oldest and least efficient vessels and by acquiring modern and efficient ships. This 
has been an important contributor towards enhancing the energy efficiency of the Company’s 
fleet and reducing its GHG emissions. 
•	For EEXI regulation compliance, company carried out calculation of EEXI values and approvals of 
EEXI technical file for all company vessels. The vessels for which overridable power limitations 
were to be installed to meet this EEXI requirements, company contracted with makers and has 
completed installation on all expect one vessel.

Description of Risk/
Concern
Action Taken
•	In our research on decarbonization we conducted trials with two technologies. One vessel we 
installed ultrasonic equipment for protection of propeller from biofouling, the trial is under 
progress and the expectation is that this will help us avoid regular propeller polishing and will 
keep propeller free of fouling thereby assist in emission reduction. The second technology, an 
In-transit hull cleaning robot was tried out on couple of ships, in this technology vessel staff can 
carry out hull cleaning of vertical sides during vessel’s sea passage saving the cost on stoppage 
and regular hull cleaning.
•	Use of combustion catalysts fuel additives on Company vessels
•	All the Company vessels are complying with regulation 12 of IMO MARPOL Annex VI on Ozone 
Depleting Substance (ODS).
•	Applicable Company vessels are complying with regulation 15 of IMO MARPOL Annex VI on 
Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) and have implemented Class approved VOC management plan.
To meet the new regulations, Emissions Trading System (ETS) from European Union (EU), your 
company has contracted with a broker for the purchase & management of EUAs for non-pool 
vessels and for pool vessels it will be handled by respective pool managers.
Our company has been assigned Spanish Registry for opening of Maritime Operator Holding 
Account for holding and submission of EUA allowances by EU. We have already initiated the 
process for the same and expect the account to be opened in Q1FY25.
Ballast water
Ballast water is essential for safe and efficient shipping operations. It reduces stress on the 
vessel’s hull, substituting weight lost due to consumption of potable water and fuel and changes 
to cargo load. However, loading and unloading untreated ballast water poses serious ecological, 
economic and health risks as ships become a vector for the transfer of organisms between 
ecosystems.
A ballast water exchange system involves the substitution of water in a ship’s ballast tanks using 
either a sequential, flow-through, dilution or other exchange method which is recommended 
or made obligatory by the IMO. A variety of technologies are used for ballast water treatment, 
these include: Filtration (physical); Chemical Disinfection (oxidizing and non-oxidizing biocides); 
Ultraviolet treatment; Deoxygenation treatment; Heat (thermal treatment) or Magnetic Field 
Treatment. A typical ballast water treatment system on board ships use two or more technologies 
to ensure that the treated ballast water is compliant with the IMO standards.
As of 31st March 2024, 5% of the Company’s vessels are fitted with exchange systems and 95% 
have installed treatment technology. The Company intends to complete remaining 02 installation 
of treatment systems by respective vessel’s IMO mandated due date.
Domestic Discharges
Sewage: The discharge of sewage from ships into the sea, can create a health hazard and 
contribute to marine pollution. Sewage can also lead to oxygen depletion and can be an obvious 
visual pollution in coastal areas – a major problem for countries with tourism industry.
It is generally considered that on the high seas, the oceans are capable of assimilating and 
dealing with raw sewage through natural bacterial action. Therefore, the regulations in Annex IV 
of MARPOL prohibit the discharge of sewage into the sea within a specified distance from the 
nearest land, unless otherwise provided.
All the Company vessels are fitted with Flag approved Sewage Treatment System in compliance 
with IMO’s MAPROL Annex IV requirements. Additionally, some ships have holding arrangements 
to meet the local restriction with respect to discharge of treated sewage.
