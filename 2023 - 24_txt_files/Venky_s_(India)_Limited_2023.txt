challenges, targets and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
As a leader in poultry industry the Company has employed state of the art technology in its operations.
The operations of the Company ensure that it shall not disturb the ecology and environmental balance
surrounding to it. For this, the Company has adopted the latest technology which is at par with the
global standards. The live bird operations of the Company ensure safety and optimal use of resources

is biodegradable in nature, is recycled and used in poultry activities and other allied activities like
agriculture. The Company also regularly reviews and improves the process of new technology development,

The Company along with its poultry farming operations also carries out the business of poultry feeds and
feed supplements. The main ingredients of the poultry feed are Soya and Maize. The Company directly
procures the agricultural produce like soya from local farmers in the area where company is operating,
thereby eliminating the role of mediators.  The Company while procuring good quality of material (Soya

deficient country and the Company, being in the business of poultry, strives to provide protein rich
sources of food at affordable prices. This is the foregoing objective of the Company resulting in promoting
wellbeing of the society. Further, since most of the units of the Company are located in rural / remote
