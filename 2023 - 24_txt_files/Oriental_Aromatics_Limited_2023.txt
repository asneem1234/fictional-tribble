BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITY & 
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT (BRSR)
Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) is the practice of companies disclosing information 
about their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance. It goes beyond financial reporting to 
provide stakeholders with a comprehensive view of a company’s non-financial impacts and contributions to 
sustainable development. BRSR covers topics such as environmental impact, social responsibility, and governance 
practices, aiming to promote transparency and accountability.

 1
Climate Change 
and Emissions
 Risk
The chemical industry faces the risk 
of plant emissions, environmental 
degradation, and social repercussions. 
Such incidents can profoundly affect 
the company's business operations 
and revenue streams. Therefore, 
ensuring proper treatment of plant 
emissions is critical to mitigating 
adverse impacts and safeguarding 
the 
company's 
reputation 
and 
financial stability.
By engaging in energy efficient 
technologies, OAL targets to 
reduce the greenhouse gases. 
Renewable energy such as 
biomass boilers are put in place 
to reduce dependency on fossil 
fuels. Additionally, OAL has 
committed to SBTi projects and 
obtained CDP and EcoVadis 
certification.

Energy 
Management
Opportunity
The 
Company 
with 
continuous 
process 
reengineering 
and 
by 
monitoring its energy requirements 
of  finished goods tries to optimise 
energy consumptions during product 
development which in turn helps in 
reducing the manufacturing costs. 
There is an opportunity to increase 
the renewable energy mix, having a 
positive impact on the environment 
as well as increasing the company's 
reputation 
as 
a 
environmentally 
conscious company.
 -
 Positive
 3
Occupational 
Health & Safety
 Risk
Occupational Health and Safety 
are of immense concern at OAL as 
there are high volumes of hazardous 
chemicals used and produced in 
the factories which can severely 
impact the company socially by 
endangering 
workers' 
well-being, 
leading to accidents, injuries, and 
even 
fatalities. 
Such 
incidents 
tarnish the company's reputation, 
erode employee trust, and invite 
public scrutiny, ultimately damaging 
relationships with stakeholders and 
undermining community confidence 
in the company's operations.
OAL has a robust Occupational 
Health & Safety system and 
has 
adopted 
ISO 
45001 
for 
the 
management 
of 
Health & Safety across its 
operations. We continue to 
drive improvements in process 
safety management by taking 
necessary 
steps. 
A 
safety 
committee has been set up to 
take care of the occupational 
hazards. All our plants and 
offices are regularly assessed 
on health and safety and 
working conditions.

Employee 
Well-being and 
Satisfaction
Opportunity
Prioritizing 
employee 
wellbeing 
and satisfaction promotes a socially 
responsible environment. It reduces 
turnover rates, boosts morale, and 
enhances productivity. By fostering 
a healthy work-life balance, providing 
support 
systems, 
and 
investing 
in 
employee 
development, 
the 
company contributes to societal 
welfare, strengthens community ties, 
and upholds ethical labour standards.

Training and 
Development
Opportunity
Training and development in a 
chemical manufacturing company 
enhances 
safety, 
improves 
efficiency, 
ensures 
regulatory 
compliance, foster innovation, and 
boost employee morale, leading to 
higher productivity and reduced 
operational risks. At OAL, regular 
trainings and awareness programs 
are conducted in a timely manner. 
The events include multiple training 
programs such as behavioural, ESG 
awareness, soft skills to improve 
employee’s 
skills 
and 
overall 
development.
-
Positive
6
Product Safety 
and Quality
Risk
Product Safety and Quality is of 
paramount 
importance 
due 
to 
the nature of the product and the 
industry it serves. If the company 
fails to deliver high-quality and safe 
products, it could result in detrimental 
impacts on both the company and 
various stakeholders, including the 
environmental and social dimensions. 
This is particularly crucial for chemical 
products like camphor and others, as 
subpar quality or safety measures 
could lead to severe consequences 
for all involved parties.
To look after the product 
quality 
and 
safety 
of 
its 
products, OAL has stringent 
quality control, regular audits, 
employee training, compliance 
with 
regulatory 
standards, 
robust 
safety 
protocols, 
supplier quality management, 
advanced 
monitoring 
technology, and continuous 
improvement of processes and 
safety measures.

Corporate 
Governance 
and Regulatory 
Compliance
Risk
OAL's 
core 
business 
revolves 
around 
manufacturing 
chemical 
products, resulting in the generation 
of 
hazardous 
waste 
alongside 
other waste materials. Given the 
stringent regulations governing such 
industries, any non-compliance could 
incur penalties, fines, and significantly 
disrupt the company's operations. 
Therefore, adherence to regulatory 
standards is imperative to ensure 
smooth 
functioning 
and 
uphold 
the integrity of OAL's operations. 
Effective 
corporate 
governance 
ensures compliance with all relevant 
laws and regulations governing the 
company, 
thereby 
reducing 
the 
risk of penalties and protecting the 
company's reputation from severe 
repercussions
To mitigate the risk of non-
compliance, 
OAL 
ensures 
transparency, 
accountability, 
and 
ethical 
conduct 
by 
establishing clear guidelines 
and processes for decision-
making, 
risk 
management, 
and 
regulatory 
compliance. 
Effective corporate governance 
practices builds trust among 
stakeholders, enhancing our 
reputation and credibility in 
the 
market. 
By 
upholding 
principles of integrity, fairness, 
and responsibility at all levels 
of the organization, we create 
a culture of good governance 
that 
supports 
long-term 
sustainability 
and 
value 
creation.

provide details.
	
Yes. OAL strives to address the climate change risks arising out of greenhouse gas emission by taking up 
energy efficiency and renewable energy projects in its plants. The Company has invested in a biomass-based 
boiler to meet its steam requirements and reduce its dependence on fossil fuel. The company regularly takes 
up various energy efficiency initiatives at the plants by adopting energy efficient technologies for reducing 
greenhouse gas emission. The company’s commitment to climate action and minimizing environmental 
impact is demonstrated through their Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) certification, where they received a 
B -rating in the Management band.

10. 	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy 
adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes 
and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
	
The manufacturing process produces wastes, which comprises of plastic and steel drums, ETP sludge, 
distillation residue, glass roll, boiler ash, solid waste from building and demolition, e-waste, and plastic 
garbage. In light of this, the company has implemented efforts to ensure responsible waste management 
procedures. Our goal is to avoid the disposal of huge volumes of waste by implementing techniques that 
recycle used materials and reintroduce excess material back into the manufacturing process. The company 
follows the ‘3R’ principle, which aims to reduce, reuse, and recycle garbage.
	
We dispose of hazardous garbage using legal and environmentally safe methods, and we sell non-hazardous 
material to licensed recyclers. We handle all trash in accordance with the Consent to Operate/Hazardous 
trash authorization for each location. To reduce the generation of hazardous waste, the organization uses a 
“Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Recovery, and Disposal” approach that is refined on a regular basis. The Company 
either sends hazardous waste to authorized recyclers, disposes of it at Treatment Storage and Disposal 
Facilities (TSDF), or sells it to other companies as raw material.
	
Discarded batteries are disposed as buy back through authorized dealers. The plastic waste is properly 
collected, segregated and stored at designated place and is disposed through authorized vendors and 
e-waste is sent to certified recyclers only.
	
The construction and demolition waste is collected, segregated and reused wherever required inside the 
premises.
	
We are planning to install a composter to treat the canteen and employee’s residual waste.
	
We have ETP and STP installed at all our sites. The wastewater is reused for gardening otherwise released in 
the Nagar Nigam sewage system. The sludge generated in ETP waste is sent to a certified third party, and 
STP waste is used for gardening.
	
Recognizing the importance of water as a resource, we undertake several initiatives to optimize the 
consumption and reduce resultant wastewater generation through our reuse or recycle approach at our 
Bareilly and Baroda Plant. Effluent generated at Bareilly and Baroda is treated in Effluent Treatment Plant 
(ETP) followed by treatment in RO plant. The company has installed Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP), Reverse 
Osmosis (RO) plant to recover 70%-80% of the water from ETP effluent which is recycled to process. 
Currently we are recycling 30% pure condensate against total steam consumption of 175 TPD (tonnes per 
day). Bareilly plant recycles wash water within the same process, thus saving on almost 5 -10% of fresh water.
