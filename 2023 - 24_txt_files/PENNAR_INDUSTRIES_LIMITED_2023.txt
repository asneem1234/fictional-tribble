Climate 
Change 
Action
Risk
&
Opportunity
Climate 
change 
poses 
a 
substantial 
risk 
to 
The 
Company, with impacts evident 
in the short, medium, and long 
term. The physical threats to 
the industry are significant, 
including 
extreme 
weather 
events 
and 
water 
scarcity. 
Implementing 
responsible 
business practices is essential 
for securing long-term benefits. 
As 
the 
global 
economy 
shifts 
towards 
low-carbon 
alternatives, 
The 
Company 
may encounter regulatory and 
market challenges, such as 
evolving consumer preferences, 
rising 
product 
costs, 
and 
new government policies and 
regulations.
The Company is dedicated to 
combating climate change 
through effective measures. 
To reduce its carbon footprint, 
The 
Company 
invests 
in 
innovative 
technologies, 
utilises 
renewable 
energy 
sources, 
and 
enhances 
manufacturing 
processes. 
The Company has expanded 
its renewable energy footprint 
with additional installations.
Negative

Water
Risk
The Company recognises the 
scarcity of fresh water and 
holds a responsibility to ensure 
its availability and conservation 
for the benefit of social and 
ecological systems.
The 
Company 
treats 
wastewater and reuses it in 
manufacturing 
processes. 
Additionally, it is considering 
introducing 
methods 
to 
minimise 
water 
usage 
and 
reduce 
overall 
water 
consumption.

Waste 
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity
Waste 
management 
poses 
both risks and opportunities for 
companies. The primary risks 
include potential environmental 
damage, 
regulatory 
non-
compliance, and reputational 
harm if waste is not managed 
properly. 
Inefficient 
waste 
management 
can 
lead 
to 
increased 
operational 
costs 
and potential legal liabilities. 
However, 
effective 
waste 
management 
also 
presents 
significant 
opportunities. 
Companies can reduce costs 
through resource efficiency and 
recycling initiatives, potentially 
creating new revenue streams 
from 
waste 
by-products. 
Implementing 
innovative 
waste 
reduction 
strategies 
can 
enhance 
a 
company’s 
sustainability profile, attracting 
environmentally 
conscious 
customers and investors.
The 
Company’s 
approach 
to 
waste 
management 
at 
Pennar 
Industries 
Ltd 
embodies the principles of 
a circular economy: Reduce, 
Reuse, 
and 
Recycle. 
It 
adheres 
to 
a 
zero-defect 
standard 
in 
manufactured 
products to minimise waste 
generation 
and 
maximise 
reuse and recycling post-
manufacturing.
Waste 
at 
all 
units 
is 
segregated into hazardous 
and 
non-hazardous 
categories and disposed of 
appropriately, 
adhering 
to 
the applicable safety norms 
and 
regulations 
for 
each 
type of waste. Going forward, 
the Company is committed 
to reducing landfill waste 
from Pennar Industries Ltd 
operations.
Negative
4
Product 
Stewardship
Opportunity
By 
taking 
responsibility 
for 
the environmental and social 
impacts 
of 
their 
products 
throughout 
their 
lifecycle, 
companies 
can 
differentiate 
themselves 
in 
the 
market 
and 
appeal 
to 
increasingly 
conscious 
consumers. 
This 
approach can lead to innovative 
product designs that are more 
sustainable, 
efficient, 
and 
aligned with circular economy 
principles. 
Such 
innovations 
can result in cost savings, 
reduced environmental impact, 
and improved brand loyalty.

Directors on the Company’s Board are prohibited from engaging in any business, relationship, or activity that could potentially 
conflict with the interests of the Company or the group. Any activity or employment that could interfere with their performance 
or responsibilities to the Company, or that could be in conflict with or detrimental to the Company, is not permissible. Directors

Has the Company implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its coverage and

The Company operates a Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) plant, which processes two types of effluents: Low TDS Rinse water and 
spent acid. The Low TDS Rinse water is neutralised to a pH of 9 using a Caustic lye solution, then passed through a filter press 
to separate suspended solids. These solids, primarily Iron sludge, are sent to co-processing units such as cement factories. 
The water is then processed through a Reverse Osmosis (RO) system. The purified water is reused in the process, while the 
reject water is directed to a Multiple Effect Evaporator (MEE) feed tank.
	
The spent acid effluent is neutralised with a Lime powder solution to a pH of 9 and passed through a filter press to separate 
suspended solids. The high TDS water is treated in the MEE system. The MEE condensate water is treated through RO and 
further used in the process. The reject water is passed through an Agitated Thin Film Dryer (ATFD) system to separate solids. 
These solids are disposed of through a TSDF Telangana Government certified industry, Re-Sustainability Ltd.
