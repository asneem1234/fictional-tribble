our leadership position in the industry while upholding our responsibility towards the planet. For the past five years, we have
consistently remained a‘zero accident’operation,which, given the industry we operate in, is no mean feat.
We strive for continuous, sustainable improvements, innovations and practices. We will continue to challenge ourselves to disrupt
traditional practices and adopt cutting-edge technologies that align with our sustainability goals.
This year we have also published our maiden sustainability report that isa
reflection of our accomplishments, our safety systems,
and our commitmenttobecome more sustainable. This trust is mirrored by how our stakeholders have supported our sustainability
vision and our commitment byadapting and growing with us.
Our growth isa measure ofthefaith our customers have in us. While we have consistently prioritised improving our production
systems and reducing the cost of production through technology adoption, we have also adopted responsible practices for the
safe handling and disposal of chemicals and implemented several measures, such asthe zero liquid discharge (ZLD) system, atour

We have made hard decisions to become more sustainable, because we believe that we must leave this worlda better place than
