Contractor Safety Management 
System (CSMS) needs to be 
developed and implemented, for 
improved 
environment, 
health 
and safety culture and credibility.
Opportunity
A Contractor Safety 
Management System 
(CSMS) is essential 
for ensuring the safety 
of all stakeholders 
involved in contractor 
activities.
Tega aims to de risk 
(OH&S) activities that the 
contractors are engaged 
in, through determining the 
degree of risk it is likely to

also provides an opportunity to 
proactively implement measures 
that 
are 
in 
adherence 
with 
legal requirements, by devising 
strategies that shall result in 
mitigation / adaptation of risks or 
capitalization of opportunities.

Conducting EHS & Social legal 
assessment on a periodic basis 
facilitates TIL to identify the 
lurking risks and opportunities. 
Such 
risks 
need 
to 
be 
mitigated to prevent them from 
aggravating into serious matters. 
Simultaneously, opportunities if 
any, needs to be capitalized.
Opportunity
Creating ESG and 
EHS legal reports 
presents an opportunity 
to demonstrate 
transparency, ensure 
legal compliance, and 
maintain stakeholder 
trust by providing 
accurate and timely 
disclosures of the 
organization’s legal and 
regulatory compliance 
status.

8.
Non-inclusion / absence of ESG 
aspects in supply chain ‘code 
of conduct’ prior to onboarding 
of suppliers, may lead to non-
identification of lurking risks and 
liabilities, thereby resulting in 
higher ‘cost of neutralization’ of 
the ESG liabilities by Tega.
Risk
ESG aspects in supply 
chain needs to be 
assessed to ascertain 
whether the supply 
chain operations can 
have a cascading 
negative impact 
on Tega’s business 
activities.
	
Tega has taken a step 
forward to obtain SA 
8000 certification by 
addressing the ‘S’ 
dimension of ESG 
in the assessment 
of social matters of 
its own and of its 
contractors, in its value 
chain.
	
Tega would now 
take a step forward 
and review the ESG 
performance of its 
selected value chain 
partners.
Negative –
	
Risks emanating from 
supply chain,
	
Loss of stakeholders’ 
trust and confidence.
9.
Lack of awareness on ESG 
matters could potentially lead 
to lack of understanding of the 
emerging 
global 
ESG 
norms 
for conducting business; and 
thereby lead to inappropriate 
implementation of ESG matters.
Opportunity
By incorporating 
ESG into training and 
development activities, 
TIL would ensure that 
the workforce is aware 
and aligned with the 
ESG requirements 
in their respective 
operational domains.
-
Positive -
	
Improves understanding 
of sustainability-based 
business requirements,

responsible for the business

report, 
highlighting

related 
challenges, 
targets 
and 
achievements (listed entity 
has flexibility regarding the 
placement of this disclosure)
TIL envisions to ensure that humans and the natural world can coexist in a sustainable manner in 
the future, for which businesses must act responsibly by incorporating sustainability into all facets 
of its decision-making processes and taking into account its effects on the environment and society 
as a whole. At TIL, we’ve started the process of changing and focusing on creating value, in terms of 
sustainable performance.
We work to increase stakeholders’ trust in our Company, since they are fundamental to how we do 
business. We have therefore established a stakeholder engagement committee and identified our 
key stakeholder groups, which include both internal and external stakeholders, to better understand, 
address and document the concerns and expectations of the stakeholders. Additionally, we envision to 
identify the material KPIs by conducting a double materiality assessment and engaging and consulting 
with the relevant stakeholders. Further, we have been developing techniques for addressing the issues 
raised by stakeholders.
At TIL, we have started taking steps to move towards a low-carbon future to fight climate change 
and comply with national and international climate change goals. To take forward our involvement in 
combatting climate change, one of these actions that we had taken, was the installation of renewable 
energy facilities, such as rooftop solar and solar fence, to lessen our indirect emission footprint. 
Realising that consumption and utilization of fossil fuels in operations is one of the main sources of 
direct emissions, as an outcome of our commitment, we have put policies in place, to switch over to 
cleaner fuels through fuel switches and dual-fired boilers.
Following the epidemic, the world as we know it has changed. As conscientious corporate citizens, we 
have launched several CSR activities to improve society and local communities. Our goal is to build a 
sustainable future where people live in harmony in the natural world.

safety manuals to customers for products that are manufactured and sold to end users. These manuals include comprehensive 
instructions on responsible usage, consumption, and disposal of the product at the end of its lifecycle. Additionally, TIL emphasises 
adherence to local regulations as far as product disposition is concerned.
	
In every six months the organisation disposes the hazardous waste produced through RAMKEY, a vendor certified by the Pollution 
Control Board (PCB). Additional garbage produced is disposed off by a nearby scrap dealer.
	
The use of plastic at manufacturing facility at Dahej, is limited to essential processes. Process-generated plastic trash is disposed 
off by the GPCB (Gujarat Pollution Control Board)-approved vendor, who then recycles it in accordance with GPCB guidelines. 
Additionally, e-waste generated handed over to GPCB-approved vendor, recycles it in accordance with GPCB regulations. Rubber 
that has been partially and fully cured (also known as flash and spline) as a byproduct of making mill liners is handed over to 
GPCB-approved vendor, who then recycles and recovers the rubber for use in accordance with GPCB guidelines.

TIL has appropriate processes and procedures have been established to receive and redress grievances from employees 
(permanent & non-permanent) and workers (permanent & non-permanent). Currently at TIL, the mechanism to capture 
grievances of the employees comprises of whistle-blower mechanism and the POSH, both of which have board approved policies 
and procedures implemented.
	
The mechanism of whistle-blower comprises of lodging of complaints by the employee within 30 days after becoming aware of 
the incident, which is then investigated by the vigilance officer followed by submission of the same to the vigilance committee. 
The committee then conducts an internal audit, wherein if unethical & improper act is concluded by the committee, then the audit 
committee enforces disciplinary or corrective action.
	
The mechanism of POSH comprises of lodging of detailed complaint along with documentary evidence, if available. Post receipt 
of the complaint and prior to initiating the inquiry, the committee take steps to conciliate the complaint between the complainant 
and the respondent. During inquiry all the proceedings are documented, and the committee interviews the respondent separately 
and impartially. Committee states exactly what the allegation is and who has made the allegation. The respondent is given full 
opportunity to respond and provide any evidence, etc. Detailed notes of the meetings are prepared which may be shared with

the respondent and complainant upon request. Any witnesses produced by the respondent are also interviewed & statements 
are taken. Post the inquiry the committee submits its report containing the findings and recommendations to the employer, 
within 10 days of completion of the inquiry. Appropriate steps are taken depending on whether the complaint is unsubstantiated 
or substantiated.
	
To receive and redress the grievances of workers, currently there are two mechanisms – the first mechanism comprises of the 
workers registering complaints directly with the plant HR or departmental supervisor or the plant head, which is then subsequently 
investigated and addressed. The second mechanism comprises of suggestion boxes which are available at all the manufacturing 
facilities. Each month the suggestions submitted in the boxes are reviewed by the internal committee of the plants and appropriate 
measures are taken to address the concerns/suggestions submitted by the workers.

Do you have a focal point (Individual/ Committee) responsible for addressing human rights impacts or issues caused or 
contributed to by the business? (Yes/No)
	
The responsibility for addressing human rights implications is shared by several committees at the corporate office and plant levels, 
including the social performance team, internal committee, and grievance addressal committee. These teams and committees are 
investigating various human rights issues at both the corporate office and plant levels.
5.	
Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues.
	
There are currently whistleblower and POSH policies and procedures in place as internal tools to address complaints pertaining 
to human rights. To address the aspects of human rights, additional frameworks and standards have been put in place. Below are 
some highlights of the same specifics –
	
(a) 	 Whistle Blower Policy
	
	
The Company believes in the conduct of the affairs of its constituents in a fair and transparent manner by adopting highest 
standards of professionalism, honesty, integrity, and ethical behaviour.
	
	
Though being a mandatory requirement, this mechanism facilitates to report concerns of unethical behaviour, actual or 
suspected, fraud or violation of the Company’s code of conduct or ethics.
	
(b) 	 POSH Policy
	
	
As an organization we are committed to ensuring that the work environment at all our locations and workplace is conducive 
to fair, safe and harmonious relations between employees. We as a Company respect the dignity of all employees working for 
the Company irrespective of their gender, hierarchy and we expect responsible conduct and behaviour on the part of all our 
employees at all levels. In compliance with the Act, any complaint under this policy shall be followed by a formal redressal 
mechanism as described in this Policy.
	
(c) 	 Ethics and Fairness in Business: TIL is committed to Social & Ethical values of fair business. Also, to demonstrate 
Company’s intention to protect and empower all its personnel within Company’s influence & control by respecting the 
International Human Right Norms as well as National Labour Laws, we have implemented SA 8000:2014. This involve 
ensuring a good working condition, giving appropriate wages, ensuring higher levels of health and safety measures, and 
prevention of discrimination and that there is no room for forced labour or any other form of modern slavery, apart from 
no existence of dangerous working conditions and coercion for co-existence. In compliance with requirements specific to 
human rights, any suggestion/complaint under this requirement shall be followed by a formal redressal mechanism.
	
	
This implementation encompasses the designated four fundamental rights at work, as laid down in Article 2 of the ILO 
Declaration of Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work 1998. We ensure the following in our workplace:
	
	
1. 	
Freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining,
	
	
2. 	
The elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labour,
	
	
3. 	
The effective abolition of child labour,
	
	
4.	
The elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation.
	
(d) 	 Prevention of Environmental Damage
	
	
We at TIL believe that every stakeholder has the right to a healthy environment, good health, food, and water. While we 
strictly adhere to national environmental regulations, we have also taken measures to prevent environmental damage. We 
have initiated the process of positive water balance by trying to recharge the water wherever it is practically possible both 
inside the plant, as well as exploring other areas where there is a scarcity of water for facilitating water recharge, which 
would eventually result in water-food-livelihood social security. We have considered low carbon intensive business activities 
in our plant operations that results in reduction of effect on climate change. All such initiatives have been taken in view that if 
97
Corporate Overview
Statutory Reports
Financial Statements
such measures are not taken, then these could otherwise negatively impact human rights of the local and global community. 
We have put in place external & internal communication mechanism to include concerns and expectations raised by external 
& internal stakeholders as a part of EMS (ISO 14001:2015).
	
(e) 	 No Forceful Acquisition of Land for Business Activities
	
	
We at TIL, in principle believe that for individuals and communities, access to land and natural resources are necessary 
for their livelihood and survival. Hence, their rights to property, housing, food, and water will be abused, if their land is 
taken away forcefully from them. We therefore strictly abide by the laws of the land. In case of land that is to be acquired 
for the purpose of business activities, necessary legal procedure is followed and appropriate rehabilitation and settlement 
provisions for the impacted community/individuals is done (if required).
	
(f) 	 Ensuring appropriate Occupational, Health and Safety measures
	
	
We have implemented ISO 45001, Occupational Health, and Safety Management System (OHSMS) in the manufacturing 
facilities of TIL, in India that ensures that the human rights of individuals are not impacted to the extent practicable, on 
account of working in a safe & healthy environment.
	
(g) 	 Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) measures
	
	
We believe that we should make a focused approach to operate in ways that enhance our credibility towards the society and 
the environment we are operating. We believe that CSR initiatives will also help in improving the life of various marginalised 
and disadvantaged section of the society in addition to protection of the environment.
	
	
In this respect, we have developed and implemented a CSR Policy that identifies the need and concerns of the disadvantaged 
and marginalised section of the society, followed by identifying appropriate measures to address their needs. The CSR 
programs that are taken in alignment with the needs of the community and environment are monitored periodically by 
the board members.
