1.
Ethics, 
Accountability, 
and 
Transparency
Risk and 
Opportunity
Adherence to the highest standards 
of transparency and business ethics 
results in corporate governance 
excellence. Our governance 
mechanism is designed to promote 
transparency in the system, 
adherence to compliances, and 
ensuring accountability. The 
mechanism strives to create 
a value system to achieve 
business excellence and increase 
stakeholder confidence.
To strengthen the value system, 
the Company has implemented 
ethical policies and framework to 
inculcate a culture of compliance 
and governance. With regular 
communication, training and 
awareness sessions of the 
employees, extended workforce, 
and suppliers, the Company 
drives ethical behavior. Many of 
these policies are available on 
Company’s website for the benefit 
of all the stakeholders.
Unethical behavior, non-
compliance, and violation 
of any form may bring 
punitive and reputational 
repercussions, beside loss 
of investors’ confidence 
and brand erosion.
2.
Safe and 
Healthy 
Working 
Conditions
Risk and 
Opportunity
By identifying health and safe 
working condition as a risk 
and opportunity, the Company 
prioritises the well-being of its 
employees, complies with legal 
norms, maintains operational 
efficiency & continuity, and 
manages costs effectively. These 
factors, contribute to the overall 
sustainability and long-term 
success of the company. Our 
priority is to ensure a safe working 
environment for all our employees 
and workers with primary focus 
on safety management system, 
mitigation of associated hazards, 
regular training and mock drills, 
periodic risk assessment, and 
continual improvement in OHS 
management system.
A strong security system is in 
place to fulfill the Zero Harm 
vision. These processes are well 
designed, rely on real-time data, 
and are centered on the shared-
responsibility principle.
At Sona Comstar, we have set 
high standards of occupational 
safety at all our premises. Regular 
assessment of health and safety 
practices and working conditions 
for all our plants and offices to 
identify gaps, if any and develop 
corrective action plans.
Respective Plant management 
teams, along with key facility 
workers, are responsible for 
implementing adequate safety 
policies, procedures, and 
measures from a corporate 
governance standpoint.
Health and Safety 
related incidents may 
cause disruption, impact 
employee morale, and 
business reputation 
leading to negative 
financial implications.
3.
Product Safety 
and Quality
Risk and 
Opportunity
Our aim is to strive for quality 
excellence and our core values 
– ‘Vitality, Frugality, and Agility’ 
reflect our approach in developing 
products that create positive 
customer experience.
On one hand, Opportunities 
outweigh the Risks such as 
competitive advantage, foster 
customer satisfaction and customer 
loyalty, strong brand equity & image 
and drive business success. While, 
on the other hand, product quality 
and safety pose threats in the form 
of potential harm to consumers, 
non-compliance with regulatory 
& statutory norms and negative 
impacts on brand reputation and 
revenue.
Our product responsibility extends 
beyond manufacturing and sales, 
contributing to cleaner and safer 
mobility. The key guiding principle 
of our approach is to minimise 
the impact on environment while 
maximising safety, economic and 
social impact.
Our manufacturing facilities 
are IATF 16949 certified which 
stands for continual improvement, 
emphasising defect prevention, 
and reduction of variation and 
waste in the supply chain and 
assembly process.
Defective products may 
account for product 
recalls. Product recalls can 
also impact consumers’ 
quality perception, which 
can result in reputational 
harm damage.
Product recall may 
increase cost due to 
product replacements and 
the creation of product 
fixes, apart from the 
litigation cost.

4.
Material 
Sourcing
Opportunity
In an auto-component business, 
identifying material sourcing as a 
risk and/or opportunity, proactively 
allows in addressing supply chain 
vulnerabilities, strengthening 
value chain resilience, improving 
competitiveness, effectively 
managing costs, fostering 
innovation, and driving quality and 
long-term sustainability in business 
operations.
Sona Comstar selects the best 
materials suitable for respective 
end application thereby optimising 
the amount of material utilised in 
operations. Furthermore, we have 
adopted circular economy by 
using recycled input material and 
returnable packaging wherever 
possible.
--
Responsible material 
sourcing could result in 
higher levels of consumer 
satisfaction, sustainability, 
and an increase in market 
competitiveness.
5.
Solutions for 
low carbon 
mobility
Opportunity
Sona Comstar believes that 
electrified mobility is necessary to 
reduce the GHG emissions arising 
from automobiles and for a greener 
planet. It has therefore embarked 
on a journey to increase its revenue 
from battery electric vehicles 
(BEV) and focused its R&D efforts 
towards developing drive motors, 
controllers, and transmission 
solutions for different types of 
electric vehicles.
--
As of 31st March 2024, we 
derived 29% of our sales 
from BEV. We have won 
54 EV programs across 30 
unique customers. We will 
increasingly derive higher 
percentage of our revenue 
from EVs and target 
to achieve 45% of our 
revenue from EV targeted 
products by 2026.
6.
Energy 
Management
Opportunity
Our energy policy is primarily 
focused on improving energy 
efficiency in our operations, 
execution of innovative projects to 
optimise energy demand, and the 
proactive use of renewable energy.
--
Energy saving initiatives 
and enhanced use of 
renewable energy would 
result in sustainability and 
reduce the company’s 
specific energy 
consumption thereby 
leading to financial 
savings.
7.
Emissions 
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity
One of the most important solutions 
to climate change is reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions, which is 
why it is so important in executing 
our commitments for carbon 
management & greenhouse gas 
mitigation.
We intend to increase the 
proportion of renewable electricity 
in our total energy consumption for 
the reduction of GHG emissions 
and saving energy by using 
electricity generated from the solar 
plant. We have also taken targets 
for reduction in specific energy 
consumption to improve energy 
intensity in our operations.
There may potentially 
be negative financial 
implications and 
reputational damage in 
case of failure to meet the 
commitment towards GHG 
reduction.
8.
Waste 
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity
Safe management of both 
hazardous and non-hazardous 
wastes is an important business 
conduct issue for every 
manufacturing industry.
Our Management Policy on 
Environment directs us to 
implement effective and efficient 
waste management practices with 
an aim to recycle and reduce the 
waste generated while transforming 
resources into valuable products
We have implemented initiatives 
throughout the year, such as 
recycling of waste die lube 
recovered from manufacturing 
operations.
Improper management 
of waste may lead to 
environmental pollution/
contamination, regulatory 
fines and notices, adverse 
impacts on health, and 
community protest that 
will negatively impact the 
brand’s reputation.

Respect for 
Individuals
Risk and 
Opportunity
Sona Comstar is ensuring 100% 
employees are trained on aspects 
of “respect towards Individuals”. 
We are committed to providing 
our workers and officers with 
equal opportunities in terms of 
recognition, advancement, and 
career path, regardless of their 
origin or views, and do not tolerate 
any form of discrimination or 
harassment.
Any violation in human rights 
may lead to regulatory, legal, and 
legislative challenges besides 
making the company not a 
preferred employer of choice.
Our induction programmes are 
structured in a manner which 
highlights awareness of human 
rights for new employees and 
refresher training. Sona Comstar 
complies with all the required 
labor laws and is OHSAS 18001 
certified. We also provide training 
to our employees at the time 
of induction about the code of 
conduct which covers human 
rights issues such as child labor, 
gender diversity, workplace 
discrimination. We also get 
background verification conducted 
through a third party for all the 
new employees.
The Company strives to uphold 
the basic principles of human 
rights in all its operations. This is 
in alignment with its codes and 
policies.
We also provide a vigil mechanism 
for our employees to report 
genuine concerns for any unfair 
and unjust incident under the 
ambit of law.
We have also been certified as a 
Great Place to Work.
Potential to negatively 
impact the brand image,
