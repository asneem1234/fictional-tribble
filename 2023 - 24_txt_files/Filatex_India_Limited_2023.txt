In alignment with our commitment to maintain the utmost

associated data, we have developed and implemented a 
comprehensive cyber risk management policy that adheres 
to industry best practices and regulatory standards. Here is 
an overview of our core cybersecurity strategies:
1.	
Firewall Management: Utilizing advanced Dell 
Sonic Firewall devices, we have updated our 
firewalls with the latest anti-virus packages. These 
are configured with stringent policies to restrict 
both external and internal access, with WAN 
policies explicitly limiting external accessibility.
2.	
Network Configuration: Our network leverages 
MPLS connectivity and Virtual Private Network (VPN) 
implementations across various locations, thereby 
ensuring secure and seamless access to data and our 
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems.
3.	
Malware Defense: We have positioned our servers 
behind firewalls with updated anti-virus software 
capable of scanning and neutralizing a wide spectrum 
of malicious threats, including Malware, Ransomware, 
and various other viruses.
4.	
Data Backup and Recovery: Comprehensive in-
house data secure management is maintained, with 
backups conducted bi-daily and redundant copies 
stored on Microsoft's Azure Servers.
5.	
Technical Team Oversight: A dedicated and 
experienced technical team is in place to manage the 
firewalls, servers, and network infrastructure.
6.	
Mobile 
Device 
Management 
(MDM): 
The 
implementation of MDM ensures that emails are 
configured by the IT team exclusively on senior officers' 
devices, following precise management guidelines.
7.	
Domain Policy Enforcement: We employ stringent 
Domain Group Policies to restrict users from attaching 
unauthorized mobile devices, and to govern Internet 
usage across the organization.
8.	
Email Security: Utilization of Microsoft's O365 
suite provides robust virus and spam management 
capabilities, enhancing email security.
9.	
IT Department Security: The IT department across all 
locations is safeguarded through restricted access to 
authorized personnel only, further mitigating potential 
internal threats.
10.	 Compliance and Regulatory Adherence: Our cyber 
risk management policy ensures compliance with all 
applicable legal and regulatory requirements, providing 
an additional layer of assurance to our investors.
These advanced technical implementations underline 
our robust approach to cybersecurity, emphasizing both 
proactive and reactive strategies to safeguard the integrity, 
availability, and confidentiality of our digital assets. We 
continually assess and update our security posture to align 
with emerging threats and technological advancements, 
reflecting 
our 
unwavering 
commitment 
to 
protect 
shareholder value and uphold our reputation as a secure 
and trustworthy organization.
6. Provide details of any corrective actions taken 
or underway on issues relating to advertising, 
and delivery of essential services; cyber security 
and data privacy of customers; re-occurrence
