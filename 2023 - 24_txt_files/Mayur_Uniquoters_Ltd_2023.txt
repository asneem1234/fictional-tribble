The establishment of an Oxygen Zone
in Mayur offers a promising opportunity.
This initiative not only contributes to
environmental sustainability but also
brings about long-term benefits for the
ecosystem. By undertaking this
project, the company can effectively
enhance its brand image, while
fostering a deeper sense of community
engagement and connection.
1.
We 
have 
extraordinary
accomplishment of planting a total of
6000 trees across four distinct
locations: Badawali, Bhomiya Ji Park,
Singod Kalan, and Jaitpura School
Ground. These sites, conveniently
positioned within a radius of 1 km and
3 km near our Dhodsar factory, evoke
a sense of joy and fulfillment.
2.
During this reporting period, a total of
6000 plants were established, and we
have successfully planted 23000 trees
on 28 hectares of land so far.
Air quality poses various risks for
companies, including potential health
hazards for employees, decreased
productivity, increased absenteeism,
higher healthcare costs, and potential
damage to the company’s reputation.
Poor air quality can lead to respiratory
issues, allergies, and other health
problems, which can result in
reduced employee performance and
efficiency. Moreover, high levels of
air pollution can lead to increased
sick leaves and healthcare expenses
for both employees and the
Company.
During the reporting period, a Bag Filter
was installed in one Thermopack unit as
a technological intervention to improve air
quality. The site plan highlights ten
emission points, and specific points of
critical emissions have been identified for
monitoring purposes.
Clean water and sanitation risks for
companies include compromised
employee 
health, 
increased
operational costs, regulatory non-
compliance, reputational damage, and
legal liabilities. Insufficient access to
clean water can lead to waterborne
diseases, while poor sanitation
facilities can impact productivity and
cause accidents. Non-compliance
with regulations can result in fines
and penalties, damaging reputation
and stability. Inadequate facilities may
lead to legal liabilities and financial
burdens.
We have further improved the water
quality by inducing technological
advancement in our ETP process by
installing oil skimmer & tank for separating
the oil & Inhouse lab setup done for testing
of waste water.

Greenhouse gas emissions can lead

For Decreasing the GHG, we are moving
towards sourcing from Local Suppliers:
for reducing the transportation distance
Green Supply chain: We want our supply
chain to comply with our policies and we
have 
conducted 
sustainability
assessment for our key suppliers
As part of our ongoing efforts, we continue
to engage in conducting a comprehensive
Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of our
product. Our primary objective is to gain
a thorough understanding of the product’s
carbon 
dioxide 
(CO2) 
emissions
throughout its manufacturing process.
Moreover, we are actively exploring
opportunities 
to 
replace 
certain
components with Sustainable alternatives.
By adopting this approach, we aim to
mitigate our ecological impact and
transition towards a more sustainable
product.
Exploring energy consumption,
monitoring, and efficiency presents
an excellent opportunity to optimize
resource 
utilization, 
minimize
environmental impact, and enhance
operational efficiency. By focusing on
these aspects, organizations can
drive sustainability, reduce costs, and
improve overall performance while
contributing to a greener and more
sustainable future.

1. Recycled Yarn and Bio PVC
Combinations
We have achieved notable progress
in developing materials that combine
Recycled Yarn  with Bio-based PVC.
One of our key products, utilizing
Recycled Yarn and Regular PVC, has
successfully passed initial quality and
feasibility assessments. Building on
this success, we developed a
product incorporating Recycled Yarn
and Bio PVC. Although initial
feedback highlighted the need for an
additional bio filler component, our
response was swift and effective. We
created a new variant that includes
Recycled Yarn, Bio PVC, and Bio
Filler. Preliminary customer testing
has yielded positive results, and we
are now preparing for further emission
testing and seat development
evaluations.
2. Bio PVC with Various Fabric
Combinations
In our quest to enhance sustainability,
we have transitioned from regular
fabrics to recycled fabrics in our Bio
PVC products. For instance, our
product combining Bio PVC with
Regular Fabric has been upgraded
to use recycled fabric. This change
reflects our ongoing efforts to reduce
environmental impact by minimizing
the use of virgin materials.
Several innovative combinations of
Bio PVC with Recycled material
Fabric and Bio PVC with Bio Filler
and Recycled  material Fabric have
been developed and tested. Test
packages for these advanced
materials have been dispatched, with
feedback eagerly anticipated. These
developments 
underscore 
our
dedication to incorporating recycled
Sustainable products can help
companies to meet the growing
demand for eco-friendly products,
differentiate 
themselves 
from
competitors, save money, improve
their public image, and comply with
regulations. A survey was conducted
by the Company from which we
came to know that approximately
73% of consumers are willing to pay
more for sustainable products.It also

stewardship, we have conducted Life
Cycle Assessments (LCA) and
Environmental Product Declarations
(EPDs) for several of our products.
For example, the LCA project for
Regular PVC combined with Regular
Fabric has been completed, providing
valuable 
insights 
into 
the
environmental 
impact 
of 
our
materials. Similarly, we have
completed an LCA project for Bio PVC
combined with Recycled Fabric,
further demonstrating our commitment
to evaluating and improving the
sustainability of our products.
Product data for combinations of
Regular Polyurethane (PUR) and
Regular Fabric have also been
submitted for LCA and EPD studies.
These initiatives highlight our
proactive approach to understanding
and mitigating the environmental
footprint of our products, ensuring that
we remain at the cutting edge of
sustainable manufacturing.
4. Collaborative Efforts
Our success in sustainable product
development is bolstered by strong
collaborations with leading automotive
manufacturers. These partnerships
are instrumental in advancing our
sustainability initiatives and ensuring
that our products meet the rigorous
demands of the automotive industry.

2.
Recycled Yarn and Bio PVC Combinations -We have achieved notable progress in developing materials that combine
Recycled Yarn  with Bio-based PVC. One of our key products, utilizing Recycled Yarn and Regular PVC, has successfully
passed initial quality and feasibility assessments. Building on this success, we developed a product incorporating Recycled
Yarn and Bio PVC. Although initial feedback highlighted the need for an additional bio filler component, our response was
swift and effective. We created a new variant that includes Recycled Yarn, Bio PVC, and Bio Filler. Preliminary customer
testing has yielded positive results, and we are now preparing for further emission testing and seat development evaluations.
3.
Bio PVC with Various Fabric Combinations In our quest to enhance sustainability, we have transitioned from regular
fabrics to recycled fabrics in our Bio PVC products. For instance, our product combining Bio PVC with Regular Fabric has
been upgraded to use recycled fabric. This change reflects our ongoing efforts to reduce environmental impact by minimizing
the use of virgin materials.
Several innovative combinations of Bio PVC with Recycled material Fabric and Bio PVC with Bio Filler and Recycled  material
Fabric have been developed and tested. Test packages for these advanced materials have been dispatched, with feedback
eagerly anticipated. These developments underscore our dedication to incorporating recycled and bio-based components
into our products, aligning with our sustainability goals
4.
Life Cycle Assessment and Environmental Product Declarations-As part of our commitment to transparency and
environmental stewardship, we have conducted Life Cycle Assessments (LCA) and Environmental Product Declarations
(EPDs) for several of our products. For example, the LCA project for Regular PVC combined with Regular Fabric has been
completed, providing valuable insights into the environmental impact of our materials. Similarly, we have completed an LCA
project for Bio PVC combined with Recycled Fabric, further demonstrating our commitment to evaluating and improving the
sustainability of our products.
Product data for combinations of Regular Polyurethane (PUR) and Regular Fabric have also been submitted for LCA and EPD
studies. These initiatives highlight our proactive approach to understanding and mitigating the environmental footprint of our
products, ensuring that we remain at the cutting edge of sustainable manufacturing.
5.
Collaborative Efforts - Our success in sustainable product development is bolstered by strong collaborations with leading
automotive manufacturers. These partnerships are instrumental in advancing our sustainability initiatives and ensuring that
our products meet the rigorous demands of the automotive industry.
