growth.
Positive, as successful 
customer relationship can 
drive revenue growth and 
profitability.
Supply chain 
management
Risk
Nelco depends on its 
supply chain partners for 
Satcom equipment and 
bandwidth capacity. Any 
disruption in timely supply, 
price escalations, and/or 
regulatory compliance, 
can profoundly affect the 
company’s operations 
and its ability to deliver 
satisfactory services to 
customers.
Building a resilient 
supply chain by 
diversification of 
supply chain partners, 
continual stakeholder 
engagement, and 
comprehensive supply 
chain assessment. 
Well managed supply 
chain disruptions 
can indeed present 
opportunities for 
maintaining and even 
strengthening supply 
chain relationships that 
can lead to stronger 
partnerships that 
endure beyond the 
disruptions
Negative as due to supply 
chain disruptions might 
lead to price escalations, 
increased costs, slower 
customer satisfaction, and 
reduced competitiveness
Talent 
Management
Opportunity

and builds newer 
competencies to aid its 
multifold growth. The 
Company also plans to

drive business growth and 
success.
Corporate 
Governance 
and Ethics
Risk

SoPs to ensure good 
corporate governance.

continuity 
and Risk 
Management
Risk
The Company’s 
infrastructure is vulnerable 
to interruptions caused by 
earthquakes, floods, heavy 
rainfall, catastrophes, power 
outages, fire and other 
similar events. Information 
technology system failures, 
security breaches or human 
errors can affect the quality 
of services and impact 
customer satisfaction.
Failure to have a proper 
business continuity 
framework and integration 
in risk management 
can compromise the 
organization’s resilience and 
sustenance
Nelco has established 
a risk management 
framework and policy 
based on which 
existing and emerging 
risks are identified and 
assessed across its 
business segments
The Risk Management 
Committee (RMC) 
is responsible for 
monitoring and 
reviewing the risk 
management plan 
and ensuring its 
effectiveness.

risks are discussed with 
RMC three times a year.

identified by the 
businesses and 
functions are 
systematically 
addressed through 
mitigating actions on a 
continuous basis.
Negative due to higher 
expenditure in mitigation 
measures & asset cost,

disruptions, increased 
recovery costs, and damage 
to brand reputation
