26. 	 Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues
	
Please indicate material responsible business conduct and sustainability issues pertaining to environmental and social 
matters that present a risk or an opportunity to your business, rationale for identifying the same, and approach to adapt or 
mitigate the risk along with its financial implications, as per the following format
	
Identifying the universe of relevant ESG topics : This was done based on discussions with internal stakeholders, peer review 
and benchmarking, sector scans, media reports and secondary sources that provided a pool of sustainability topics. These 
were further analyzed and evaluated for consideration at a strategic level. Adherence to crucial issues as per different 
standards and frameworks was also ensured.
	
Detailing the stakeholder engagement methodology: We had sent detailed questionnaires to various stakeholder groups 
that were identified. Our external stakeholders included Customers, Shareholders and Vendors/Suppliers. Our internal 
stakeholders consisted of our employees and management team. While for other stakeholders we have done desktop 
research to incorporate their priorities.
	
Data collection: We used online surveys to collect data and information from stakeholders to prioritize the list of identified 
ESG topics. Diverse responses were captured to understand the length and breadth of all possible issues. The designing of 
the questionnaire was done with the objective of bringing out the key issues, risks and opportunities from the stakeholders’ 
point of view and then mapping it for the material issues. In addition to the survey, we conducted in-depth discussions 
with a subset of stakeholders to gain a comprehensive understanding of their primary concerns.
	
Discussion with the management team, CSR & ESG Committee and the Board: the outcome of the exercise was discussed 
with the leadership to arrive at the key focus areas keeping in view, their relevance to stakeholders and business, as well 
as their impact on sustainability development.

1
Water Scarcity and 
Pollution
Risk
India faces significant 
water 
scarcity 
and 
pollution 
challenges, 
impacting 
both 
e n v i r o n m e n t a l 
sustainability 
and 
operational continuity 
for 
manufacturing 
industries like footwear.
Relaxo has reduced its 
water 
consumption 
through efficient measures, 
actively 
conducts 
water 
conservation 
projects 
across 
its 
operations, 
and is in the process of 
implementing Zero Liquid 
Discharge (ZLD) systems in 
all plants, ensuring treated 
water reuse in non-potable 
operations.
Initially, there may be capital 
investments required for 
upgrading equipment and 
implementing conservation 
measures. However, in the 
long term, reduced water 
consumption and potential 
regulatory 
compliance 
benefits can lead to positive 
financial outcomes.
2
Carbon Emissions 
and Climate Change
Risk
Increasing 
awareness 
and regulations related 
to carbon emissions and 
climate change pose 
risks 
to 
operations, 
supply 
chains, 
and 
market acceptance.
Company 
has 
already 
begun the work on reducing 
emissions – Conversion of 
biomass-based 
boiler 
to 
PNG-based boilers;
Transitioned 
to 
Servo 
Motors; Installation of VFDs 
on Motors; Installed Dust 
Collector; CFC to LED; Retro 
fitment of DGs to dual fuel 
mode. 
Initial 
investments 
in 
technology 
upgrades 
and 
process 
changes 
may have upfront costs. 
However, reduced energy 
consumption, 
regulatory 
compliance, and enhanced 
brand value as a sustainable 
company 
can 
result 
in 
positive financial outcomes 
over time.
3
Product Safety and 
Quality Assurance
Opportunity
Ensuring 
product 
safety and quality is 
critical for customer 
satisfaction, regulatory 
compliance, and market 
competitiveness.
The 
company 
ensures 
Product Safety & Quality 
assurance by Implementing 
stringent 
quality 
control 
measures, 
conducting 
regular 
product 
testing 
and certification including 
BIS 
Certification, 
and 
investing in research and 
development for innovative 
and sustainable materials.
Costs 
associated 
with 
quality 
assurance 
and 
R&D investments may be 
incurred initially. However, 
enhanced customer trust, 
reduced recall risks, and 
market differentiation can 
lead to positive financial 
outcomes.
4
Community 
Engagement and 
Social Impact
Opportunity
Engaging 
with 
local 
communities, 
supporting 
social 
causes, and investing 
in 
community 
development initiatives 
can 
enhance 
brand 
reputation, 
foster 
positive relationships, 
and 
create 
shared 
value.
The company has initiated 
projects aimed at creating 
long-term 
positive 
impacts 
on 
people’s 
lives, 
focusing 
on 
key 
areas such as “Education 
& 
Skill 
Development,” 
“Health” and “Environment 
Conservation.”
Costs 
associated 
with 
community projects and 
partnerships 
may 
be 
incurred. However, improved 
brand 
image, 
increased 
customer 
loyalty, 
and 
access to new markets can 
lead to positive financial 
outcomes and long-term 
sustainability.
5
Energy Management 
and Renewable 
Sources
Opportunity
Rising energy costs, 
dependence 
on 
fossil 
fuels, 
and 
environmental concerns 
necessitate 
a 
shift 
towards 
sustainable 
energy practices and 
renewable sources.
The company has begun 
investing 
in 
energy-
efficient 
technologies, 
adopting renewable energy 
sources for manufacturing 
facilities, 
optimizing 
energy 
consumption 
through 
smart 
systems 
and controls, and obtaining 
energy 
certifications 
or 
accreditations.
Initial 
investments 
in 
renewable 
energy 
infrastructure 
and 
technology upgrades may be 
required. However, reduced 
energy 
costs, 
potential 
incentives or subsidies for 
renewable energy adoption, 
and 
enhanced 
brand 
reputation as a sustainable 
company 
can 
result 
in 
positive financial outcomes 
over time.

Digital 
Transformation and 
Technology Adoption
Opportunity
Rapid 
advancements 
in digital technologies 
offer opportunities to 
enhance 
operational 
efficiency, 
product 
innovation, 
customer 
engagement, 
and 
supply chain visibility.
Embracing 
digital 
transformation 
initiatives 
such as implementing data 
analytics 
and 
leveraging 
e-commerce 
platforms 
for sales and marketing 
and 
integrating 
smart 
technologies for real-time 
monitoring and decision-
making.
Initial 
investments 
in 
digital 
infrastructure, 
software 
solutions, 
and 
employee 
training 
may 
be 
required. 
However, 
improved productivity, cost 
savings from streamlined 
processes, 
enhanced 
customer experiences, and 
competitive 
advantages 
in the market can lead to 
positive financial outcomes 
and business growth.

within 
the company using ISO

Negative. 
Weak 
cybersecurity 
in 
the 
company 
can 
have 
significant 
financial 
implications, including costs 
related to data breaches, 
loss of intellectual property, 
operational 
disruptions, 
legal fees, and damage 
to reputation and brand 
image.
8
Occupational Health 
and Safety
Risk
Failure to ensure health 
and safety could result 
in reduced availability 
of manpower, reduced 
employee morale, or 
even 
threaten 
the 
viability of operations in 
worst -case scenarios.
Relaxo 
realises 
the 
importance of the well-being 
and safety of its employees 
and is actively engaged in 
Identifying, comprehensively 
understanding, 
and 
implementing measures to 
control and eliminate risks 
associated with workplace 
hazards. 
This 
includes 
developing an automation 
and 
mechanization 
plan 
aimed at phasing out high-
risk manual activities. Also, 
formulating a robust policy 
on Occupational Health & 
Safety to ensure the well-
being and safety of all 
employees.
Negative.
Failure to ensure health 
and safety could result in 
increased costs, damage 
to reputation and brand 
image.
