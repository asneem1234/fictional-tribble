1
Ethics and
Compliance
Risk
The Company expects all its 
employees to adhere to the 
Code of Conduct Policy of 
SSWL and practice Ethical 
behaviour. The Company 
follows zero tolerance for 
any non-compliance as this 
will have an adverse impact 
on the Company. Due to 
the dynamic nature of laws, 
rules and regulations, it has 
become imperative for the 
company to ensure their 
compliance. Any failure to 
comply with the same may 
impact on the reputation of 
the Company  adversely.
SSWL’s Code of Conduct, Whistle 
Blower Policy, Code of Conduct for 
prevention of insider trading, code 
of 
practices 
and 
procedures 
for 
fair disclosure of unpublished price 
sensitive 
information, 
Policy 
on 
materiality of Related Party Transaction 
and 
Grievance 
Redressal 
across 
stakeholders ensures ethical behavior 
and compliance with applicable laws 
and regulations. The said Codes and 
policies provide for a framework for 
employees and other stakeholders 
to ensure that business is governed 
only by ethical practices. Further, any 
amendments to the laws, rules and 
regulations are checked on a regular 
basis. The said policies and code 
of conduct alongwith any changes 
thereon are duly communicated to the 
concerned stakeholder groups.
Negative

Health and 
Safety
Risk
Managing safety and health 
is a top priority at SSWL. 
Safe places and the good 
health 
of 
employees 
at 
work contribute to better 
productivity. 
Risk 
Assessment 
is 
a 
continuous process followed 
by measures to effectively 
control them   to ensure 
safety and good health of 
our employees at work.
To mitigate the risk, we strictly follow 
the rules and procedures laid down 
by our stringent health and safety 
management systems. We regularly 
conduct trainings to create awareness 
of safe working conditions and building 
confidence of the employees. Further, 
the Company conducts routine health 
check-ups and maintains internal 
health centers to monitor the well-
being of our employees.
Negative

Employees 
Productivity 
and 
Retention
Opportunity and 
Risk
Employees’ 
engagement 
and productivity contribute to 
the growth of the Company. 
To meet the organization 
goals 
and 
customer 
expectations, 
employees 
with creativity, innovative 
ideas 
and 
expertise 
in 
different areas are an asset 
to the Company. Attrition 
of talent has a negative 
impact on the growth of the 
company.
Focused 
approach 
on 
employee 
engagement and retention of talent 
through multiple initiatives includes 
providing cross functional access, 
training 
opportunities, 
recognitions 
and skill development. The Company 
continuously makes efforts  to promote 
diversity and offer equal  opportunities 
to all irrespective of  their age, gender, 
colour or religion etc.

Competition
Risk and 
Opportunity
Competition in the business 
has increased significantly 
causing a serious adverse 
impact 
on 
the margins 
of 
the 
auto 
component 
manufacturers. 
Customer 
dissatisfaction with price, 
quality,  delivery performance 
and design could lead to a 
loss of market share. 
The Company continues to strive to 
improve its operational performance, 
strict quality controls and develop  new 
components, which are  technologically 
superior and have an edge over its 
competitors.
The Company works closely with its 
key customers on product development 
and remains ahead on the technology 
curve.

developing

competition into opportunity.

Social costs
Risk
SSWL’s assumptions while 
estimating 
social 
costs 
like gratuity funding are 
subject to capital market 
and actuarial risks and any 
shortfall could put pressure 
on financial performance of 
the Company.
A framework to manage social cost 
risks has been deployed to ensure 
that obligations remain affordable and 
sustainable.

Community 
Well-being
Opportunity
The Company believes in 
corporate excellence and 
social welfare. This corporate 
philosophy is the force for 
integrating Corporate Social 
Responsibility (CSR) into 
Company’s values, culture, 
operation 
and 
business 
decisions at all levels of 
the 
organization. 
Being 
a 
responsible 
corporate 
citizen, the Company has a 
value system of giving back 
to society and improving the 
quality of life of communities 
and 
the 
surrounding 
environment. The company 
is   committed   to its social 
responsibility 
by 
taking 
various initiatives in the fields 
of education, public health, 
environment and community 
welfare, etc. which would 
benefit society at large.

Climate and 
Environment
Risk and 
opportunity
Manufacturing sectors are 
generally associated 
with 
high pollution during the 
manufacturing 
processes. 
Growing 
environmental 
concerns have made the 
Companies 
to 
focus its 
investments on renewable 
sources  of energy and 
controlling 
& 
modifying 
of 
various 
manufacturing 
processes having adverse 
impacts on the environment.
SSWL is working on alternate sources 
of 
energy, 
water 
recycling 
and 
enhanced use of returnable packaging 
to minimize waste and maximize reuse. 
The company is constantly striving 
ahead in converting its fossil fuel based 
power 
consumption to 
renewable 
resources. The Company has invested 
in Clean Max Astria Pvt. Ltd. (CMAPL), 
a special purpose vehicle engaged in 
the business of production, generation, 
supply and distribution of wind, solar 
and/or hybrid power in order to off-
take Electricity generated by it under 
captive consumption. The Company 
has  installed rooftop solar facilities 
at all its plants.    The implementation 
of which has resulted in substantial 
conversion 
of 
fossil 
fuel 
power 
consumption to renewable sources. All 
plants have moved completely on fresh 
polycarbonate sheets to improve lux 
levels and save power consumption.

Water 
security
Risk
Fresh water is an important 
input for both manufacturing 
processes 
and 
domestic 
purposes of the Company. 
Processes such as paint 
booths are water intensive 
processes 
in 
automotive 
industry. It is important to 
use quality water to maintain 
the 
paint 
quality. 
Water 
scarcity 
is 
India’s 
silent 
crisis 
and 
unpredictable 
rainfall across India makes 
the 
manufacturing 
plants 
more vulnerable for water 
shortages. Hence, insulating 
against water risk is one of 
the identified business risks 
and priorities.
The Company strives to mitigate 
the water risk by adopting following 
methods: 
•	 Optimum usage of water in all 
operations through various water 
efficiency measures adopted such 
as low volume water taps, arresting 
leakages in pipelines, amongst 
others.
•	 Rainwater harvesting: By increasing 
rainwater storage capacity.
•	 Recycling: By installing ETP/STP 
and RO plants, we strive to increase 
our water recycling capacity.
•	 Ground water recharge: By installing 
specially designed deep aquifer pits 
for improving ground water table to 
ensure the availability of water for 
the community.

Supply 
Chain 
Management
Risk
The complexity and global 
span of automotive industry 
supply 
chains 
expose 
companies 
to 
significant 
sustainability and disruption 
risks, impacting operational 
continuity 
and 
leading 
to decline in sales and 
margins.
SSWL aims to develop a resilient 
supply chain framework by diversifying 
suppliers and integrating sustainability 
criteria into supplier selection. At SSWL 
we have implemented transparent 
supply chain practices to ensure 
compliance with environmental and 
social standards, thereby reducing 
potential risks.
Negative

Energy 
Management
Risk and 
opportunity
The 
use 
of 
energy 
is 
an inevitable part of the 
Company’s operations.
However, efficient use and 
the implementation of our 
own 
renewable 
energy 
sources will help in improving 
the Company’s operations. 
In 
the 
short-term, 
there 
may be a negative impact 
from investing in renewable 
sources of energy, however, 
in the long-term there would 
be a positive impact from 
methodical use of these 
energy sources and aligning 
with industry expectations.
SSWL is constantly striving ahead 
in converting its fossil fuel power 
consumption to renewable resources. 
The Company is actively engaged in 
energy management. The Company 
has invested in Clean Max Astria Pvt. 
Ltd. (CMAPL), a special purpose vehicle 
engaged in the business of production, 
generation, supply and distribution of 
wind, solar and/or hybrid power to off-
take Electricity generated by it under 
captive consumption. The Company 
has installed rooftop solar facilities at 
all its plants. All plants have moved

Information/ 
Cyber 
security
Risk
The fast pace at which 
the auto sector is growing 
at present, it is bound to 
face concerns relating to 
Internet 
Protocols, 
data 
privacy and risk-shifting for 
warranty issues that would 
need to be addressed to 
settle uncertainties amongst 
stakeholders. Further, threats 
of 
external 
cyber-attacks, 
hacking and internal leakage, 
modification of information, 
failure to protect information 
are other concern issues.
The Company focuses on continuous 
protection of confidential information 
across the IT landscape to prevent 
loss/theft of confidential data through 
installation and regular updations 
of various antivirus and malware 
protection softwares, firewalls, etc. 
Periodic audits are conducted to 
ensure adherence to the processes. 
Additionally, the company has obtained 
ISO- 27001 certification to comply best 
in class IT norms.
