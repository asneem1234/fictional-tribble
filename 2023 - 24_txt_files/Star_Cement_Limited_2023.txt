Dear Stakeholders,
As we reflect on our journey towards sustainability, it’s clear that our commitment to environmental, social and 
governance (ESG) principles is not just a responsibility but a defining trait of who we are as a company. As we 
embark on our second Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR), I am honored to share some 
reflections on our progress and our path forward.
At Star Cement Limited, we recognize that our operations have a significant impact on the society around us. As a 
leading cement manufacturing Company, we have a responsibility to not only meet the demands of our customers 
but also to do so in a way that minimizes harm to the environment, enhances the well-being of our communities, 
and upholds the highest standards of governance.
Over the past year, we have made significant strides in advancing our sustainability agenda. Through innovative 
technologies, process improvements, and strategic partnerships, we endeavor to become water positive, reduce 
our carbon footprint, enhance diversity amongst workforce, adhere to safety standards and create positive social 
impact through multipronged interventions in the areas of health, education, livelihood, skill enhancement, rural 
development etc.
We are proud to announce that we have achieved National Award for Safest Workplace (Large Enterprises – Cement 
Sector) Year 2023, 11th Global Safety Sumit Powered by World Safety Forum, UK and Environmental Excellence & 
Health and Safety Excellence in cement manufacturing, “3rd Edition of National Awards on Cement and Concrete 
Industry and Net Zero Conclave’’ Powered by Quality circle Forum of India.
These efforts are not just about meeting regulatory requirements; they are a testament to our unwavering 
commitment to sustainability leadership.
As leaders, it’s incumbent upon us to set the tone for our Company. We must lead by example, demonstrating 
integrity, transparency and accountability in all that we do. We must empower our teams to think creatively, act 
boldly and challenge the status quo. And we must never lose sight of the impact of our decisions on the society 
around us.
I want to express my deepest gratitude to each and every member of the Star Cement Limited team. Your hard 
work, dedication and passion are the driving force behind our success and I am proud to stand alongside you as we

spaces, fire hazards, scaffolding and heavy lifting, are addressed through mitigation strategies outlined in SOPs

operations to not only overcome challenges as a result of availability of fuel, but also build resilience against the 
rising fuel prices. Star Cement focusses at enhancing utilisation of green energy in the form of solar power and 
waste heat recovery to replace coal-based power. In this endeavour, the Company has installed 24.8 MW WHRS 
capacity in its Lumshnong plant.
iii.	 Clinker Factor Reduction: By gradually lowering the amount of clinker in cement products and using 
alternative raw materials like fly ash and slag, the Company is able to lower the carbon footprint associated with 
the calcination of limestone. Approximately, more than 90% of the Company’s cement portfolio comprises of 
blended cement which is an integral part of our climate strategy. As a result, clinker factor reduced from 66.7%

10.	Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the 
strategy adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your 
products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
Star Cement Limited has implemented a waste management strategy in line with the Company's vision of reducing 
landfill waste through a practical and sustainable system. To operationalize this vision, Star Cement Limited has 
developed comprehensive waste standard operating procedures (SOPs) to guide the proper handling of both 
hazardous and non-hazardous waste, adhering to applicable regulations.
The company places significant emphasis on waste segregation and storage. To achieve this goal, Star Cement 
Limited has established separate scrap yards at the plant level to store hazardous and non-hazardous waste in 
segregated manners, complete with proper labelling. For waste disposal, Star Cement Limited has engaged 
authorized vendors for the disposal of hazardous waste, while non-hazardous waste is managed through local 
vendors.
