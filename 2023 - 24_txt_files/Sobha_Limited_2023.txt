Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues
Please indicate material responsible business conduct and sustainability issues pertaining to environmental and social 
matters that present a risk or an opportunity to your business, rationale for identifying the same, approach to adapt or 
mitigate the risk along-with its financial implications, as per the following format.
We live in an uncertain and constantly changing world. A formal process to identify material sustainability issues helps 
us report on those that matter most to our business and stakeholders. A sustainability issue is material to us if it 
meets two conditions. First, if it is considered a principal risk or an element of a principal risk, which could impact our 
business or performance. And secondly, if it is deemed to be important to our key stakeholders, including our people, 
consumers, customers (retailers), suppliers and business partners, planet and society (citizens, NGOs, governments) 
and our employees. We use our sustainability materiality assessment to identify priority sustainability issues across our 
value chain so that we can report on the issues of most interest to our stakeholders. The following table captures the

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG  related challenges, targets and 
achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure): 
At SOBHA we have various mechanisms and systems in place to ensure our focus on ESG remains strong. Our ‘Towards 
better living’ principle focuses on making our planet more sustainable, committing to compassionate social development 
and conducting business with the highest ethical standards. 
Protecting our environment has been a focus since inception. Our product quality is of the highest standards in the 
industry, made possible by stringent processes and sustainability practices deeply embedded. Across our operations 
and projects, we use an integrated solid waste management system that operates on the 4R principles — Reduce, Reuse, 
Recycle and Recover that has helped minimising environmental impact. 
The real estate business is a long gestation business with an even longer value chain characterised by many regulations 
and stipulations within which real estate companies have to work with. The sector is more regulated and monitored since 
the establishment of RERA (Real Estate Regulatory Authority). Customers have welcomed this change. This has also had 
a positive impact on the sector with developers and builders more accountable and adhering to various norms. SOBHA’s 
strength lies in the transparency and integrity of its organization and the way it conducts business – a critical factor that 
continues to attract customers to SOBHA, in addition to the quality and timely delivery of projects. 
Our focus and efforts will be in addressing opportunities and challenges alike. We will set up more robust systems to better 
measure, monitor and analyse operational data to make process improvements, minimise material usage and wastage, 
better water and waste management, increase adaption of renewable energy while reducing overall energy consumption. 
Across our projects we consciously will look at better material and adopt construction technologies to make building last 
longer, reduce the need for maintenance, and implement innovative designs that further enhance ‘green cover’.

INFORMATION FOR OUR 
SHAREHOLDERS 
.
Availability of skilled labour and qualified technicians is a growing challenge, given other less challenging job opportunities 
that don’t require too much physical labour. This is an area that needs to be addressed holistically with enhanced 
Government, education, and industry participation with a clear objective to enhance competencies and better use of 
modern technology and practices. With regulations getting more stringent, SOBHA will enhance its management practices 
to ensure an inclusive approach to better addressing governance. 
As we continue to grow, SOBHA will evolve, deepening its focus on enhancing a wellbeing of employee, a more sustainable 
planet, healthier and prosperous communities and an organization thriving with employees who wish to make long and 
fulfilling careers at SOBHA.

noise testing and air monitoring test records, are kept on file and updated on a regular basis.

improvement. Examination of accidents and determination of their causes detailed information from the accident 
reports.
	
We use the safety manager’s monthly reports and the department head’s audits, plans for corrective action, and 
improvement targets to gather independent data on the effectiveness, reliability and efficiency of the entire health 
and safety management system. Effectiveness is increased by gathering data through face-to –face interviews, 
document analysis, and visual observations.
	
SOBHA takes a systematic and co-ordinated approach to managing workplace risks. We use risk assessment to 
identify and eliminate risks and we prefer hierarchy to prioritize measures to combat risks. We also use engineering 
controls and collective measures to minimize risks. Finally, we use PPE as a last resort only when necessary.

related customer benefits. Provision of signages within the product also guides the customers to identify the features 
and its usage. Customer satisfaction is ensured by having continuous engagement right from the day of possession 
till society handover, timely response to their grievances and prompt service support. We do take feedback from our 
customers through customer surveys in which we request the customer to share feedback about their experience of 
the product, their journey throughout the possession of their flat, etc. These feedbacks provide an opportunity to us 
to understand the customer pain points and liking of the sustainability and other features and thereby improve on the 
offerings and processes.
