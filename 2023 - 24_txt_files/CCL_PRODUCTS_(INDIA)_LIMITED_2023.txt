Yes, the Company’s efforts were focused on devel-
oping energy-efficient processes for instant coffee 
production, which involved selecting advanced pro-
file roasters and incorporating waste heat recovery 
systems to optimize roasting and drying processes. 
ZLD (Zero Liquid Discharge) Technologies were 
chosen to minimize waste generation during instant 
coffee production and explore innovative methods 
for reusing or recycling wastewater and by-products. 
Technologies such as membrane filtration or reverse 
osmosis were employed to reduce water usage. A 
state-of-the-art pilot plant has been commissioned 
to reduce the batch size, thereby decreasing the 
environmental impact. The Company has 900 KLD 
ZLD in operation.
