At Deepak Nitrite Limited (‘DNL’), sustainability is deeply embedded 
in our core business, operation strategies and decision-making 
processes. In line with our commitment to responsible business 
practices, we are dedicated to realizing our Environmental, Social 
and Governance (ESG) objectives. We focus on conducting our 
business in a manner that protects the environment, contributes 
positively to society and generates long-term value for all 
stakeholders.
Every year we enhance our ESG strategies and collaborate with 
our stakeholders to achieve mutually beneficial ESG objectives. 
Our environmental initiatives are centred on reducing our 
environmental impact through strategic measures such as 
increasing the share of renewable energy in our total energy mix 
and lower carbon emissions. We have implemented advanced 
technologies such as Mechanical Vapor Recompression (MVR) 
for water recycling and recovering raw materials from effluent 
streams to promote resource efficiency. Additionally, we have taken 
proactive measures to reduce our GHG emissions by substituting 
conventional fuels with alternative sources in our boilers. These 
initiatives align with circular economy principles and promote 
sustainable waste management practices, ensuring that our 
operations are environmentally sound.
Our dedication extends to cultivate a safe, inclusive and enriching 
work environment for our employees and communities alike. 
Upholding stringent ethical standards and prioritizing the 
development of high-quality products, our efforts transcend 
mere compliance. Beyond mandatory trainings, we implement 
comprehensive human rights education and skill enhancement 
programs, recognizing that effective human capital management 
is pivotal to our ongoing success. Our policies are focused on 
enhancing community well-being and ensuring a supportive 
workplace environment. Our employees being our most valuable 
asset, we work towards their welfare through robust programs 
covering health, wellness, work-life balance and rigorous safety 
measures. Continuous learning and development are central to our 
HR policies, with a range of training programs designed to enhance 
technical skills, leadership capabilities and personal growth. 
Committed to creating an equitable workplace, we promote 
diversity, inclusion and equal opportunities, striving to eliminate all 
forms of discrimination.
Our community development efforts aim to generate value by 
focusing on education, healthcare and skills development to 
empower marginalized communities. Our approach involves 
closely engaging with stakeholders to comprehend their needs 
and ambitions and promote resilience among marginalized 
communities. Through these efforts, we strive to create a lasting 
positive impact that supports inclusive growth for all members of 
society.
The foundation of DNL’s governance framework is built on the 
principles of integrity, transparency and accountability. We adhere 
to the highest standards of corporate governance, ensuring that 
our operations are conducted ethically and transparently. Our 
robust code of conduct outlines ethical behaviour expectations 
for all employees, with regular training on ethical practices 
and mechanisms in place for reporting and addressing any 
unethical behaviour. Transparency is central to our sustainability 
efforts at DNL. As a practice, we publicly report on our ESG 
initiatives, including sustainable sourcing. Additionally, we 
actively collaborate with industry peers, government and non-
governmental organisations. These partnerships drive sustainable 
solutions, knowledge sharing and the adoption of best practices, 
amplifying our impact and advancing global sustainability goals. 
By working together strategically, we aim to create lasting positive 
change in both environmental stewardship and societal well-being.
DNL is dedicated to continuously enhancing our sustainability 
performance through adopting a comprehensive approach to 
sustainability. By integrating ESG principles into our environmental, 
social and governance strategies, we ensure that our efforts not 
only drive economic growth but also create positive and lasting 
impacts on the environment and society, setting new standards for 
excellence in sustainability.

1
Water Use 
& Effluent 
Management
Opportunity
Access to clean and safe water 
is 
a 
fundamental 
human 
right and is aligned with the 
United Nations' Sustainable 
Development Goal 6, which 
aims to be achieved by 2030. 
As a responsible corporate 
citizen, we are committed to 
ensuring that our operations 
do not negatively impact the 
quality or supply of water 
resources, thereby protecting 
the ecosystem and society at 
multiple levels.
NA
Positive - Effective water use 
and 
effluent 
management 
can drive significant positive 
financial 
outcomes 
for 
businesses. 
By 
optimizing 
water usage and managing 
effluent 
responsibly, 
companies 
can 
reduce 
operational costs, enhance 
resource 
efficiency 
and 
mitigate regulatory risks.
2
Climate 
Change & 
Emissions
Risk
Climate change & Emissions 
stands as one of the most 
critical challenges confronting 
our planet today. Given the 
energy and water-intensive 
nature of chemical production, 
our failure to reduce our 
environmental footprint can 
have significant repercussions 
on our standing within the 
industry and our relationships 
with customers, investors and 
society as a whole.
We 
have 
embraced 
environmental 
consciousness 
through our commitment to 
sustainable 
manufacturing 
practices. 
This 
commitment 
is evident in our focus on 
reducing utility consumption, 
extracting value from waste and 
adopting 
clean 
technologies. 
We are continuously striving to 
enhance our energy efficiency. 
Additionally, we ensure that the 
effluents, emissions and waste 
generated at our manufacturing 
facilities 
remain 
within 
the 
permissible limits set by the 
respective 
Pollution 
Control 
Boards.
Negative - Climate change & 
Emissions related issues, if 
not addressed, would result in 
negative financial implications 
in long run.
Climate 
related 
risks 
including physical as well as 
transition risk are directly 
associated with disruptions 
to our business operations 
as well as those of our value 
chain 
partners. 
Financial 
implications 
of 
mitigation 
efforts are well within our 
considerations while planning 
our business strategy
3
Occupational 
Health & 
Safety
Risk
Given the inherent nature 
of 
our 
operations, 
our 
employees 
face 
a 
range 
of operational and safety 
hazards. It is crucial to address 
any process safety gaps and 
prevent occupational health 
and safety (OHS) incidents 
that could potentially harm 
our 
employees. 
Neglecting 
employee 
well-being 
and 
safety not only jeopardises 
their physical welfare but 
also poses risks to achieving 
production targets and can 
have adverse effects on our 
assets, 
environment 
and 
overall business reputation.
We 
prioritise 
continuous 
safeguarding 
of 
occupational 
health, safety and employee well-
being. Stringent safety measures 
are implemented at all our sites, 
including regular safety audits 
and the provision of appropriate 
personal protective equipment 
to our employees. We actively 
promote 
safety 
awareness 
through campaigns and training 
initiatives.
Negative - Employee health 
and 
safety 
issues, 
if 
not 
addressed, would result in 
negative financial implications.

Opportunity
Engaging with the community 
in its development not only 
uplifts 
the 
community’s 
standard of living but also 
cultivates future workers and 
consumers 
for 
businesses 
associated 
with 
the 
end 
products. 
This 
proactive 
involvement also enhances 
the 
Company’s 
reputation 
by 
fostering 
goodwill 
as 
a 
benefactor 
within 
the 
community.
NA
Positive - The benefits to the 
community provided by CSR 
activities 
develop 
goodwill 
and boost the Company’s 
brand, which has long-term 
financial benefits.
5
Growth & 
Profitability
Opportunity
The Company’s capacity to 
deliver substantial value to 
all stakeholders hinges on its 
robust financial foundation. 
In light of escalating input 
and 
energy 
costs 
and 
enduring volatility in foreign 
exchange rates, maintaining 
a secure financial position 
is imperative. This stability 
not only fortifies its market 
position but also strengthens 
relationships 
with 
clients, 
investors and the broader 
public.
The 
Company 
strategically 
allocates 
financial 
resources 
in adherence to governance 
standards and best business 
practices to ensure sustainable 
profitability. 
It 
prioritizes 
disciplined investments within a 
robust framework and employs 
structured 
cost 
management 
to optimize financial outcomes. 
By 
consistently 
exploring 
opportunities along the value 
chain and maintaining agility 
in response to evolving market 
dynamics, the Company sustains 
its performance and enhances its 
competitive edge.
Positive - A planned and 
methodical 
approach 
to 
investments 
and 
cost 
management 
will 
be 
determining factor to the 
success of the Company in the 
short run as well as in the long 
run.

Corporate 
Governance
Risk
Amid the dynamic landscape 
of 
the 
chemical 
industry, 
which is characterised by 
escalating 
macro-economic 
volatility, robust governance 
practices 
play 
a 
pivotal 
role 
in 
upholding 
ethical 
and 
transparent 
business 
operations. Meeting regulatory 
compliance requirements and 
effectively 
managing 
risks 
are paramount in ensuring 
responsible conduct and long-
term sustainability.
Our 
governance 
practices 
have been established by our 
competent 
and 
esteemed 
Board of Directors, comprising 
members with relevant industry 
expertise, independent thinking 
and extensive global exposure. 
Aided by practice transparency in 
financial reporting, sustainability 
efforts 
and 
other 
relevant 
disclosures and ethical decision-
making 
processes, 
bolstered 
by effective risk management, 
serve as the foundation of 
our 
governance 
framework. 
We have instilled a culture of 
accountability 
and 
integrity 
across the Company, recognising 
its vital role in promoting good 
governance practices.
We implement and enforce a 
robust code of conduct and 
ethical 
standards 
to 
guide 
the 
behaviour 
and 
actions 
of employees at all levels. 
Our Board and management 
prioritise health, safety and 
environmental 
considerations 
by implementing robust safety 
protocols, promoting sustainable 
practices 
and 
minimising 
environmental 
impact. 
We 
have 
a 
comprehensive 
risk 
management 
framework 
to 
identify, assess and mitigate 
risks associated with operations, 
safety, 
environmental 
impact 
and 
compliance 
to 
solidify 
our governance approach. We 
ensure strict adherence to all 
applicable laws, regulations and 
industry standards to maintain 
compliance and mitigate legal 
and reputational risks. We have 
established Board Committees, 
such as Audit, Risk Management, 
Nomination and Remuneration, 
CSR, Sustainability Committees 
and more to provide focussed 
oversight 
in 
critical 
areas. 
We 
regularly 
evaluate 
our 
governance practices, identify 
areas 
for 
improvement 
and 
implement necessary changes 
to enhance effectiveness and 
relevance and build trust with all 
stakeholders in line with global 
standards of ESG.
Negative 
- 
Corporate 
Governance is increasingly the 
parameter for evaluation by 
external stakeholders and are 
likely to amplify competitive 
advantage relating to  business 
sustainability. In case of their 
failure, it would have severe 
financial implications.

Business 
Ethics & 
Compliance
Opportunity
Success in business depends 
on creating and sustaining 
a 
culture 
of 
ethics 
and 
integrity. It supports daily 
decision-making by providing 
employees and partners with a 
useful reference.
NA
Positive - Prioritizing business 
ethics and compliance can 
lead to significant financial 
benefits for organizations. By 
adhering to ethical standards 
and regulatory requirements, 
companies 
mitigate 
legal 
risks and avoid costly fines 
and penalties. A strong ethical 
culture also fosters trust and 
credibility with stakeholders, 
enhancing customer loyalty, 
investor 
confidence 
and 
employee morale.

Business 
Continuity
Opportunity
Risk 
management 
and 
ethics 
are 
interconnected. 
A 
company 
faces 
lower 
risks to its business when it 
adheres to ethical standards. 
Aligning business ethics with 
risk management is crucial 
for ensuring continuity and 
resilience during disruptive 
incidents.
NA
Positive - Business continuity 
ensures 
resilience 
against 
disruptions, 
minimizing 
revenue 
loss, 
operational 
downtime and reputational 
damage. 
This 
proactive 
approach 
helps 
maintain 
customer 
trust, 
preserves 
market position and reduces 
recovery 
costs, 
ultimately 
safeguarding profitability and 
sustaining long-term financial 
health.

DNL has established a protocol to 
assess the ESG (Environmental, 
Social and Governance) impacts 
of 
products 
during 
their 
development 
stages. 
These 
impacts are carefully considered 
in 
our 
decision-making 
processes. We have calculated 
the carbon footprint for most 
of our products and planning to 
conduct Life Cycle Assessments 
(LCA) for few of our existing 
products in the fiscal year 
2023-24.
Positive - Increased circularity 
will 
result 
in 
decreased 
cost of materials, increased 
productivity 
and 
greater 
profitability. Such operational 
practices also cater to the 
customers 
preferences; 
aligned to responsibly sourced

Risk
Having a sustainable supply 
chain is critical for Company’s 
operations 
and 
business 
continuity 
Considering 
the 
size of Company’s operations, 
the Company can influence 
the ESG priorities for their 
suppliers It will have a high 
impact on stakeholders as 
well.
We maintain a robust logistics 
and distribution network using 
secure 
transportation 
with 
GPS tracking to monitor raw 
materials and finished goods 
in 
real-time. 
Our

Human Rights
Risk and 
Opportunity
Human

a crucial role in shaping 
the 
company’s 
reputation 
throughout the entire value 
chain.
Risk: Potential regulatory non-
compliance and reputational 
damage.
Opportunity: 
Upholding 
employees’ 
and 
workers’ 
rights 
through 
collective 
action.
We have implemented a robust 
Human Rights due diligence 
framework 
to 
systematically 
assess 
our 
operations. 
This 
includes 
conducting 
human 
rights vulnerability assessments 
at our operational sites to 
identify and mitigate risks, as 
well as monitoring and reporting 
our 
performance. 
We 
are 
committed to upholding human 
rights across all aspects of our 
business operations.
Our commitment to respecting 
human rights extends to our 
business 
partners 
through 
alignment with our policies and 
contractual agreements. In the 
fiscal year 2023-24, no incidents 
of 
human 
rights 
violations 
were reported, demonstrating

ethical standards throughout our 
operations.
Positive- 
Implications 
of 
non-compliance 
to 
social 
adherence 
norms 
related 
to human rights will have 
reputation impact for any 
company. 
The 
mitigation 
of 
such 
risks 
requires 
investment in human rights 
vulnerability assessment and 
actions. Proactive and regular 
compliance by the workforce is 
imperative to ensure business 
continuity in the long run.

Leadership Indicators
1.	
Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental and social 
topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.
	
The process for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental and social topics involves both 
direct and delegated mechanisms. In direct consultation, stakeholders engage with the Board through structured meetings, surveys 
and public forums, where their inputs are systematically recorded and compiled into comprehensive reports. These reports are 
subsequently presented to the Board during scheduled sessions to inform decision-making. When consultation is delegated, designated 
representatives such as Committees or managers gather stakeholder’s feedback using various methods like meetings and surveys. The 
collected feedback is synthesized into detailed summary reports, which are communicated to the Board through regular briefings or 
written submissions. This ensures that the Board is kept informed of stakeholder perspectives and can make decisions based on a broad 
range of inputs.
2.	
Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identiﬁcation and management of environmental and social 
topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these topics were 
incorporated into policies and activities of the entity.
	
Yes, the stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental and social topics. 
	
Input from stakeholders plays a crucial role in shaping policies and activities related to these areas. For instance, in response to 
community concerns about environmental impacts, formal and informal feedback from stakeholders are instrumental in enhancing 
the Company’s waste management practices, leading to the adoption of a new recycling program. Similarly, stakeholders consultation 
revealed the need for improved social policies, resulting in the development of a comprehensive community engagement strategy. 
This strategy included regular meetings and partnerships with local organizations to address social issues more effectively. These 
consultations ensure that stakeholders perspective are integrated into the Company’s policies and activities, fostering sustainable 
and community-aligned decision-making.

3.	
Provide details of instances of engagement with and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/ marginalized 
stakeholder groups.
	
Based on the stakeholders consultation and baseline surveys, the CSR activities of the Company are inter alia aimed to address the 
concerns of vulnerable/ marginalized stakeholder groups.
	
Additionally, to better address the needs of marginalized groups such as indigenous communities, the organization conducted 
focused listening sessions to understand their unique challenges related to social and cultural preservation. This engagement led to 
the implementation of culturally sensitive environmental management practices and the creation of educational programs aimed 
at preserving local requirements. Another instance includes partnering with non-profit organizations to provide health support 
services to underserved populations, thereby addressing their immediate needs and fostering long-term resilience. These actions 
demonstrate the Company’s commitment to actively engaging with and responding to the concerns of vulnerable groups, ensuring 
that their voices are heard and integrated into the decision-making process.

Statement 
of 
Independence, 
Impartiality 
and 
Competence
TÜV SÜD South Asia Pvt. Ltd is an independent professional 
services company that specializes in Health, Safety, Social and 
Environmental management services including assurance with 
over 150 years history in providing these services.
No member of the assurance team has a business relationship 
with DNL, its Directors or Managers beyond that of verification and 
assurance of sustainability data and reporting. We have conducted 
this assurance independently and we believe there to have been no 
conflict of interest.
TÜV SÜD has implemented a Code of Ethics across the business 
to maintain high ethical standards among staff in their day-to-day 
business activities.
Based on the scope of our review, our conclusions are outlined 
below:
Governance, leadership and supervision: The top management 
commitment, business model to promote inclusive growth, action 
and strategies, focus on services, risk management, protection 
and restoration of environment and priorities are represented 
adequately.
Stakeholder Inclusiveness: We have not identified any 
discrepancies in this aspect. Internal and external Stakeholder 
identification and engagement is carried out by DNL on a periodic 
basis to bring out key stakeholder concerns as material aspects of 
significant stakeholders.
Materiality: The materiality assessment process has been carried 
out, based on the requirements of the Assurance Engagements 
(ISAE) 3000 (Revised) and Guidance Note on BRSR considering 
aspects that are internal and external to DNL’s context of the 
organization. The Report fairly brings out the aspects and topics 
and its respective boundaries of the diverse operations of DNL in 
our view, the Report meets the requirements.
Responsiveness: We believe that the responses to the material 
aspects are fairly defined and captured in the Report, in our view, 
the Report meets the requirements.
Completeness: The Report has fairly disclosed the General 
and Specific Standard Disclosures including the Disclosure on 
Management Approach, monitoring systems and sustainability 
performance indicators as prescribed in the Standards in 
accordance with the Core requirement, hence in our view the 
Report meets the requirements.
Reliability: Most of the data and information was verified by 
assurance team at DNL’s manufacturing locations as well as 
corporate office and found appropriate. Minor inaccuracies in the 
data identified during the verification process were found to be 
attributable to transcription and interpretation errors and these 
errors have been corrected immediately. Therefore, in accordance 
with the ISAE 3000 (Revised) assurance engagement, TÜV SÜD 
concludes that the sustainability data, parameters, information 
and indicators presented in the Report are reliable and acceptable. 
In our view, the Report meets the requirements.
Impact: We observed and assessed that DNL has well-defined 
procedures to routinely monitor and measure their sustainability 
impact and they have skilled subject matter experts who are driving 
the sustainability effectively and efficiently. During verification
