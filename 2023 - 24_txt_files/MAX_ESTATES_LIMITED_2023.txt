OUR 
JOURNEY
Max Towers (actual image)
Revisiting  
Our Journey
Max Estates 1.0 (2016 – 2018)
During the Max Estates 1.0 phase from 2016 to 
2018, the company’s focus was primarily on the 
speciality packaging films business while also 
venturing into the broader realm of real estate. 
During this period a significant milestone was 
the development of 222 Rajpur. This exclusive 
residential community comprised 22 luxurious 
villas and was strategically situated at one of  
the most prestigious addresses in Dehradun.  
222 Rajpur not only showcased our commitment 
to quality and excellence but also laid the 
foundation for Max Estates’ journey, setting the 
stage for further growth and expansion into  
the real estate sector. We continued to build  
on these early successes, evolving our strategies  
and offerings in the subsequent phases of  
our journey.
Charting the 
Path Forward
Max Estates 2.0 (2019 – 2022)
Max Estates 2.0 marked a transformative period 
in our journey, characterised by a strategic shift 
in focus and notable achievements. In this phase, 
the company narrowed its geographic focus to 
the thriving Delhi NCR region, recognising it as  
a dynamic and promising market for real estate 
development. Within the real estate sector, the 
company honed its expertise in the Commercial 
Real Estate (CRE) asset class, leveraging its growth 
potential and unique opportunities. This phase 
saw the launch and 100% occupancy of our 
flagship project, Max Towers Noida, underscoring 
our commitment to deliver quality spaces that 
meet the needs of discerning businesses. We 
also delivered our second office building in the 
heart of Delhi, known as Max House (Phase 1), 
which achieved 100% occupancy, emphasising 
our dedication to providing premium office 
spaces in prime locations. Both Max Towers  
and Max House (Phase 1) demonstrated their 
potential by realising rentals that commanded  
a remarkable 25% to 30% premium compared  
to their respective micro markets, highlighting 
the value and quality they offered to tenants. 
Moreover, we achieved a significant milestone 
with the receipt of the Completion Certificate  
for Max Square, our 3rd commercial office 
development, in February 2023, signifying 
continued progress in the real estate development 
landscape. Looking ahead, the company has the 
exciting prospect of delivering Max House (Phase 
2) by Q3 FY24, further expanding its presence in 
Delhi and strengthening the portfolio of 
high-quality office spaces.
Max Estates 2.0 laid the groundwork for 
emergence as a key player in the Delhi NCR  
real estate market, with a strategic focus on 
Commercial Real Estate. This phase’s success 
and momentum set the stage for future  
growth and development as the company 
continues to evolve and innovate in the real 
estate sector.

This phase includes significant achievements 
and forward-looking initiatives. In the past year, 
we’ve made significant strides, increasing our 
real estate development potential from  
2 to 8 mn sq.ft. This expansion encompasses 
diversification across residential and commercial 
asset classes, expanding into various geographic 
locations in Noida, Delhi, and Gurgaon. 
We’ve made a noteworthy entry into the 
residential real estate sector in Delhi NCR by 
acquiring a 10-acre land parcel in Sector 128, 
Noida. We’ve also ventured into the thriving 
commercial real estate market in Gurgaon by 
acquiring a 7.15 acre parcel on the Golf Course 
Extension Road and secured 4 acres of land in 
Sector 129, Noida, for a mixed-use commercial 
project. We have also entered into a Joint 
Development Agreement for around 2.4 mn sq.ft. 
of residential space in Sector 36A Gurgaon. These 
acquisitions allowed the company’s portfolio to 
grow to 8 mn sq.ft. Besides these, the Hon’ble 
NCLT has also approved our Resolution Plan for 
Delhi One (~2.5-3 mn sq.ft.) the implementation 
of which is subject to approval from Noida 
authorities. Max Estates is committed to continual 
expansion, with a goal of adding at least 3 mn sq.ft. 
each to our commercial and residential portfolios 
per year, all while embracing an Environmental, 
Social, and Governance (ESG) journey, emphasizing 
sustainability, community welfare, and  
ethical practices.
Our portfolio covers projects in different 
development stages, from delivered projects  
to those nearing completion and those still  
in the design phase, all in alignment with our 
overarching strategy of ‘One region, Multiple 
asset classes’. This strategic approach reflects 
our commitment to shaping a brighter future 
through diversified, sustainable, and dynamic 
real estate offerings.

Letter to 
Shareholders
Estate 128 (Experience Center) (Actual Image)
Dear Shareholders, 
Greetings!
FY24 marked a pivotal year for Max Estates as it 
successfully completed acquisition of multiple new 
opportunities solidifying its position as a leading 
real estate development brand in the Delhi NCR 
region. 
Following the reverse merger of Max Ventures and 
Industries Limited into Max Estates in FY23, the 
Company was relisted on the NSE and BSE in 
October 2023. This newly listed entity, Max Estates, 
embodies our vision, focus, and ambitions to 
expand our real estate presence in Delhi-NCR. The 
merger has bolstered Max Estates’ balance sheet 
flexibility, enabling further growth and expansion 
of our real estate portfolio. 
In recent years, India has spearheaded global 
economic growth and emerged as the fastest-
growing major economy, driven by robust macro 
and microeconomic factors. Over the past decade, 
India maintained an average GDP growth of 5.5% 
and recorded an impressive 7.8% real GDP growth 
in FY24. This solid performance backed by a 
significant drop in the unemployment rate, rapid 
digital transformation, and substantial 
infrastructure investments, places India on track to 
become the world’s third-largest economy by 2027. 
By 2047, India is expected to have an economy 
valued between USD 33 trillion and USD 40 trillion.
Supported by a growing economy, India’s real 
estate sector has undergone significant 
transformation. Currently, the market size of India’s 
real estate sector is estimated at USD 477 billion. 
With substantial economic growth and the 
potential for real estate, by 2047, the sector is 
projected to expand to USD 5.87 trillion, 
contributing 15.5% to the total economic output. 
India’s residential real estate sector is experiencing 
tailwinds, driven by convergence of factors 
including resilient economic growth, controlled 
inflation and interest rates, high affordability levels, 
accelerating urbanization and a shift in 
preferences of millennials from renting to owning 
homes. This confluence of favorable factors will 
continue to drive robust demand for housing pan 
India in FY25 and beyond. The trend towards 
premiumization and corporatization of real estate 
demand and supply respectively coupled with 
shifts in income segmentation towards upper mid 
and high categories augurs well for players like 
Max Estates with our focus on holistic wellbeing 
through our LiveWell philosophy. 
Commercial real estate sector has rebounded to 
pre-Covid levels, reflecting a robust recovery. Gross 
Office absorption in 2023 grew by 11% year-over-
year, reaching 64 million square feet, making it the 
second-highest annual leasing activity since 2019. 
India is at the forefront of the Return-to-Office 
movement, with office utilization levels (~70%) 
surpassing those in the US, Europe (~40%), and the 
Asia Pacific (~69%) in 2023. Looking ahead to 2024, 
we anticipate continued positivity in India’s office 
market despite global economic concerns. Gross 
Office absorption is expected to surpass 65 million 
square feet in 2024, setting the stage for a historic 
milestone in India’s commercial real estate 
market.] 
Over the last couple of years, Max Estates has built 
a portfolio of 12 million square feet well of 
diversified by asset class (commercial and 
residential), geography (Gurgaon, Noida and Delhi) 
and risk spectrum (delivered, under construction 
and under design).
After successful commercial developments in 
Delhi and Noida, Max Estates expanded its 
footprint to residential developments and 
launched its first premium residential project in 
Delhi NCR with the acquisition of a ~10-acre land 
parcel in Noida. The project, named Estate 128, 
launched in June 2023, was fully sold within days, 
generating a sales booking value exceeding `1,800 
crore. 
Supported by a growing 
economy, India’s real 
estate sector has 
undergone significant 
transformation. 
Currently, the market 
size of India’s real estate 
sector is estimated at 
USD 477 billion.

Additionally, we announced our first project in 
Gurgaon with the acquisition of a 7.15-acre 
commercial land parcel on Golf Course Extension 
Road, offering development potential of 1.6 million 
square feet. In FY24, we also acquired a ~4-acre 
commercial land parcel in Sector 129, Noida, 
adjacent to Max Square, Noida, enabling a 
campus-style development with a focus on retail 
amenities.
We also ventured into our first residential real 
estate in Gurgaon through a joint development of 
a ~12-acre land parcel in Sector 36A. This project, 
Delhi NCR’s first inter-generational community 
including senior-living development, has a 
potential of 2.4 million square feet and is expected 
for launch in Q2 FY25. Additionally, in May 2024, we 
entered into another joint development 
agreement for ~18 acres of land in Gurgaon, 
contiguous to our existing ~12 acres on Dwarka 
Expressway. Combined, these residential 
opportunities represent a a development potential 
of 6.4 million square feet. 
New York Life Insurance Company (“NYL”) has 
shown unwavering commitment to our business. 
As a valued partner, NYL has already invested 
approximately `1,200 crore, securing a 49% equity 
stake in Max Square One & Two and the Sector 65, 
Gurgaon commercial project. Furthermore, NYL 
has committed to acquiring 49% stakes in two 
SPVs of Max Estates, which encompass Max Towers 
and Max House (Phase I and II). With this 
substantial investment, New York Life is a 49% 
shareholder across our entire commercial real 
estate (CRE) portfolio, underscoring their 
confidence in our growth trajectory and strategic 
vision.
We are dedicated to building a progressive real 
estate organization focused on key pillars for 
execution at scale viz., people, growth, capital, 
processes, brand, and customer centricity. Over the 
past 12 months, we have significantly upgraded 
our capabilities and bandwidth, emphasizing the 
recruitment of top-quality talent, particularly for 
our residential vertical. The Company has built 
well-diversified Commercial and Residential Real 
Estate portfolio across Delhi NCR at scale and is 
poised to accelerate its growth journey by building 
on its current portfolio spanning 12 Mn. Sq. Ft. To 
maintain our asset-light approach and diversify 
capital exposure, we will continue to acquire new

opportunities through a combination of outright 
purchase, joint developments as well as select joint 
ventures with long term credible partners 
particularly in residential segment.
Several strategic initiatives have been undertaken 
to enhance our systems and processes. We have 
identified 13 verticals across the real estate value 
chain and are institutionalizing internal processes 
to enable seamless execution at scale with the 
assistance of external advisors. The standard 
operating procedures created after thorough gap 
analysis are stress-tested through internal audits to 
ensure implementation. Our Company has proven 
its capability in design and hospitality-led 
differentiation, establishing itself as a leading real 
estate brand that enhances the quality of life 
through the spaces it creates, by “bringing real 
well-being to real estate.” Our well-being 
orientation offers a unique value proposition that 
sets us apart from competitors.
At Max Estates, we’ve paid close attention to 
creating a unique confluence of spaces that 
enable collaboration, innovation, and community, 
that are not just functional and aesthetically 
pleasing, but also environmentally sustainable, and 
designed to promote the holistic wellbeing of our 
users. 
Guided by our philosophy of WorkWell and 
LiveWell, we create differentiated working and 
living experiences by moving beyond the 
conventional separation of work, life, and well-
being, and paying attention to the entire spectrum 
of wellbeing across physical, emotional, social, and 
environmental aspects. Our developments 
personify our wellbeing orientation and bring our 
LiveWell and WorkWell philosophy to life.
Our focus on LiveWell and WorkWell is anchored 
around 5 pillars – food & nutrition, sustainability, 
community culture & hospitality, nature - biophilia, 
health & wellness and intentional design. For 
instance, we believe in incorporating nature as an 
active participant in our design, to allow for periods 
of relaxation & escape from the hustle of everyday 
life. As an illustration, the ~11,000 sq. ft. central forest 
courtyard at the heart of Max Square, our latest 
commercial development, is a testament to our 
biophilic design and philosophy.
Our existing assets, Max Towers and Max House, 
are fully leased at a 25-30% premium to the 
micro-market, to leading domestic and 
multinational companies diversified across sectors. 
Max Square, our latest commercial project in 
Noida, is over 60% leased as of June 2024. We 
delivered Max House Phase II in Q3 FY24 and 
successfully leased over 90% of its area at 60% 
higher rentals than the micro-market within six 
months. 
Our goal is to expand our portfolio across 
residential and commercial segments, while 
maintaining a strong balance sheet, robust 
cashflows and well diversified portfolio across asset 
classes and regions. By enhancing our 
organizational capacity, strengthening our 
capabilities, and institutionalizing our processes, 
we are well-positioned for execution at scale.
We sincerely thank each one of you for your 
steadfast support and belief in our vision. Our 
deepest appreciation goes to our dedicated 
employees, valued business partners, esteemed JV 
partner New York Life Insurance Company, 
committed investors and shareholders, and the

we collaborate. Your ongoing support is deeply

Relisting of Max Estates: The Company 
concluded the reverse merger of Max 
Ventures and Industries Limited (MVIL) 
into Max Estates Limited in FY24 and was 
relisted as Max Estates Limited on the 
premier stock exchanges - NSE and BSE 
in Oct’23. The new listed entity, named 
Max Estates Limited, reflects our vision, the 
nature of our business and aspirations to 
scale the Real Estate (RE) footprint in Delhi-
NCR region. The merger has enhanced 
Max Estates’ balance sheet flexibility to 
further expand and grow the RE business 
and the Company is targeting time and 
cost synergies through streamlining of 
administrative operations. 
Max Estates is rapidly expanding its real 
estate portfolio in NCR in commercial 
and residential segment: Max Estates 
Limited (erstwhile MVIL) was formed in 
2016 following the demerger of Max India 
with the legacy business of Max Speciality 
Films Limited (MSFL). In the same year, 
the Company made a strategic decision 
to venture into the Real Estate business. 
The real estate journey so far can be 
summarised in 3 phases:
Max Estates 1.0 (From 2016 to 2018): 
Experiment
During this phase, the Company focused 
on speciality packaging films business 
while also exploring the wider world of 
business including real estate. In 2018, 
Max Estates delivered 222 Rajpur, a luxury 
residential villa community situated on 
Rajpur Road in Dehradun. This project 
represented the Company’s foray into 
the real estate sector as an experiment. 
The project, with 22 luxury villas spread 
on 5 acres of land overlooking Mussoorie 
hills, in many ways seeded the concept of 
‘LiveWell’. It is fully sold, and the community 
is thriving with several families residing. 
Max Estates 2.0 (From 2019 to 2022): 
Establish
In this phase, the Company formalized its 
purpose and strategy to anchor execution. 
With the purpose of ‘Enhancing quality of 
life through spaces it creates, the Company 
chose - One region and multiple asset 
class, as its strategy to grow. With Delhi 
NCR as the playground, the Company 
chose to focus on office led commercial 
developments. During this period, Max 
Estates expanded its operations and 
ventured into notable projects. One of the 
key projects delivered during Max Estates 
2.0 was Max Towers, a commercial office 
space located at the cusp of Delhi and 
Noida. Max Towers stood out as a marquee 
development, offering innovative features 
and amenities to cater to the needs of 
businesses and enable holistic well-being 
of its tenants. Following that in 2020, Max 
House, a redevelopment project of an 
office campus in Okhla, South Delhi, was 
also completed. Both Max Towers and 
Max Estates is poised to seize 
the real estate opportunity and 
grow its operations

these projects commanded a significant 
premium of 25-30% compared to their 
respective micro markets, highlighting 
their success and attractiveness to tenants. 
The Company launched its 3rd commercial 
real estate project, Max Square, comprising 
~0.7 mn sq ft of area in Noida built on the 
theme of ‘where nature meets work”. Max 
Square received occupancy certificate 
in Feb’23 and has a mix of Indian and 
domestic companies as tenants. Currently, 
60%+ of its area is leased1. We expect it to 
be fully leased by FY25. Phase-II of Max 
House, Okhla was delivered in Nov’23 and is 
90%+ leased within 6 months of Occupancy 
at 60% higher rentals than the micro 
market. 
Max Estates 3.0 (2023 onwards): 
Expansion
FY 23 and FY 24 were transformational 
years with Max Estates scaling its portfolio 
and making strategic announcements. 
One significant move was entry into the 
premium residential real estate market 
in Delhi NCR with the acquisition of ~10-
acre residential land parcel in Noida. This 
project, which is called Estate 128 was 
launched in Jun’23 and was fully sold within 
days of launch generating a sales booking 
value of `1,800+ Crs. 
WorkWell: The Company also announced 
its entry into Gurgaon, by acquiring a 
7.15-acre commercial land parcel on Golf 
Course Extension Road with development 
potential for the office complex of 1.6 mn 
sq ft. The project is designed by Gensler, 
a global architecture and design firm. In 
FY 24, the Company acquired a ~4-acre 
commercial land parcel in Sector 129, 
Noida, adjacent to Max Square, Noida, 
allowing for an opportunity to do a campus 
style development with a strong focus on 
retail amenities 
LiveWell: The Company also entered 
residential real estate in Gurgaon by 
entering into a joint development of a ~12-
acre land parcel in Sector 36A, Gurgaon, 
Delhi NCR’s first inter-generational 
community that also includes senior-living 
focused development, with a development 
potential of 2.4 mn sq ft. The project 
will be launched in Q2 FY25. In May’24, 
the Company also entered into another 
residential joint development for ~18 acres 
of land in Gurgaon. This land parcel is 
contiguous to its existing ~12 acres of land 
on Dwarka Expressway. Both the residential 
opportunities imply a development 
potential of 6.4 Mn sq ft
These acquisitions allowed the Company’s 
portfolio to grow to 12 Mn sq ft. Besides

Global Economy is surprisingly 
resilient despite persistent 
geopolitical tensions and high 
interest rates 
The baseline forecast is for the world 
economy to continue growing at 3.24  
percent during 2024 and 2025, at the same 
pace as in 2023. Global inflation is forecast 
to decline steadily, from 6.8 percent in 2023 
to 5.9 percent in 2024 and 4.5 percent in 
2025. Core inflation is generally projected to 
decline more gradually.
Economic activity was surprisingly resilient 
through the global disinflation of 2022–23. 
As global inflation descended from its mid-
2022 peak, economic activity grew steadily, 
defying warnings of stagflation and global 
recession. Growth in employment and 
incomes held steady, reflecting supportive 
demand developments–– including 
greater-than-expected government 
spending and household consumption—
and a supply-side expansion amid, 
notably, an unanticipated boost to labor 
force participation. As inflation converges 
toward target levels and central banks 
pivot toward policy easing in many 
economies, a tightening of fiscal policies 
aimed at curbing high government debt, 
with higher taxes and lower government 
spending, is expected to weigh on growth.
On the downside, new price spikes 
stemming from geopolitical tensions, 
including those from the war in Ukraine 
and the conflict in Gaza and Israel, could, 
along with persistent core inflation where 
labor markets are still tight, raise interest 
rate expectations and reduce asset price. 
Geoeconomic fragmentation could 
intensify, with higher barriers to the flow 
of goods, capital, and people implying a 
supply-side slowdown.
In summary, businesses will need to 
develop resilience to embrace and navigate 
shorter cycles and higher degree of 
volatility. 
INDIA IS THE FASTEST GROWING 
COUNTRY AMONG LARGE ECONOMIES, 
BACKED BY ROBUST MACRO AND MICRO 
DRIVERS 
India spearheads global economic 
growth, supported by robust macro and 
microeconomic drivers. As the fastest-
growing major economy, India has 
maintained an impressive average GDP 
growth of 5.5%5 over the past decade, 
with FY24 witnessing a substantial real 
GDP growth of 7.8%6. This trajectory 
propels India towards its ambitious goal 
of becoming the world’s third-largest 
economy by 2027.
In FY24, India’s economy showed 
remarkable strength and resilience, evident 
across a multitude of key indicators: 
•	
Unemployment Rate: Returning to 
pre-Covid levels, the unemployment 
rate dipped to 6.8%, marking a 
16-month low in January 2024, down 
from a peak of 8% in 2020.
•	
Digital Transformation: Rapid 
adoption of technology facilitated a 
surge in digital lending. According to

•	
Infrastructure Investments: Toll 
revenue is projected to triple by 2030, 
signaling substantial investments in 
road infrastructure, indicative of the 
nation’s commitment to bolstering 
connectivity and logistics.
•	
Inflation Control: The inflation rate 
returned to the lower end of the RBI’s 
tolerance range of 4-6%, reflecting 
effective monetary policies and 
macroeconomic management.
•	
Interest Rate Stability: Controlled 
increments in interest rates further 
stabilized economic conditions, 
fostering an environment conducive to 
sustainable growth.
•	
Narrowing current account deficit: 
Near-record foreign exchange reserves, 
and healthy fiscal position 
Looking ahead, India’s economic expansion 
is forecasted to grow at 6.8%7 in FY25 and 
6.5% in the subsequent year. By 2047, when 
India reaches 100 years of independence, 
the size of India’s economy is estimated 
to range between USD 338 tn to USD 40 
tn.  This growth narrative is underpinned 
by robust investment activity, government 
commitment to fiscal consolidation, 
coupled with central banks disciplined 
monetary policy and vibrant private 
consumption. Furthermore, improvements 
in balance sheets across the central 
government, banking sector and financial 
institutions and private companies coupled 
with corporate deleveraging efforts, 
have strengthened the banking system, 
enabling it to navigate out of the asset 
quality cycle. 
Real Estate in India, Poised for 
Exponential Growth 
The real estate industry in India has had an 
exhilarating journey over the last 25 years. 
As the nation hurtles forward into a new era 
of urbanization, eco-nomic dynamism, and 
technological innovation, the real estate 
Supported by a growing 
economy, the real estate 
sector in India has 
transitioned 
significantly. India’s real 
estate sector has 
forward and backward 
linkages with 
approximately 250 
ancillary industries, and 
it is one of the highest 
employment generators 
after the agriculture 
sector, accounting for 
18% of the total 
employment.

landscape is poised for a transformative 
evolution. 
Supported by a growing economy, the 
real estate sector in India has transitioned 
significantly. India’s real estate sector 
has forward and backward linkages with 
approximately 250 ancillary industries, 
and it is one of the highest employment 
generators after the agriculture 
sector, accounting for 18% of the total 
employment. In terms of output, the 
market size of India’s real estate sector 
is currently estimated at USD 4777 bn 
contributing 7.3% to the total economic 
output. 
By 2047, India’s real estate sector is 
estimated to expand to USD 5.89 tn 
contributing 15.5% to the total economic 
output. Factors such as escalating demand 
for residential properties arising from rapid 
urbanization and growing disposable 
incomes of individuals are supporting the 
fast-paced expansion of the real estate 
industry in India. 
Residential real estate is highly 
underpenetrated in India- as an illustration 
housing per capita in India is 110 sq ft 
versus 700-800 sq ft in developed econ-
omies like USA and UK, this translates to 
low mortgage to GDP ratio of 11% versus 
52% - 68% in developed economies. 
Similarly commercial real estate is also 
highly underpenetrated in India - total 
office stock in India in is 855 mn sq ft 
against USA 2,644 mn sq ft; on a per capita 
basis this translates into 0.6 sq ft per person 
in India versus 8 sq ft per person in USA. 
There is a trend of premiumization driven 
by evolving consumer preferences for 
generous spaces and a comprehensive 
ecosystem of co-located amenities. This 
shift is evident in the demand for premium 
office spaces that support flexible work 
and collaborative environments, as well as 
in the preference for well-designed homes 
that offer a holistic living experience. 
With a significant growth in the size of 
the economy and the potential for real 
estate to increase its share in the overall 
GDP, the real estate industry is poised for 
enormous opportunities in terms of shifts 
in consumption patterns as well as in 
revenue expansion, translating into growth 
opportunities across price segment for 
both commercial and residential sector.

Strong Tailwinds in Residential Real 
Estate in India
The residential real estate is currently 
undergoing a bullish phase, characterised 
by convergence of factors that foster 
an extremely favourable business 
environment. India’s residential sector 
achieved an unprecedented decadal high 
in sales and new launches in 2023. The sales 
of housing units surpassed the significant 
threshold of 477,00010  units, marking 
a decade long record. This has led to 
significant reduction in available inventory 
both in Pan India (from ~6,70,00011 in Q1 
2019 to 5,80,90011 in Q1 2024) as well as in 
Delhi NCR (from ~1,82,00011 in Q1 2019 to 
86,40011 in Q1 2024).  This has been aided 
by low interest rates, which despite recent 
increases is lower than pre-Covid peak 
unlike other economies like US and UK 
coupled with improvement in affordability 
index which, affordability index increased 
28% compared to 2014.
There was a significant increase in demand 
for housing loan, with major banks 
disbursing `2.712  lakh crore of credit up 
to January 2024, representing an annual 
surge of approximately 37%. 
Throughout 2023, India’s premium 
and luxury real estate sector witnessed 
exceptional activity, registering 75%13 Y-o-Y 
growth, and increased by 2.5x over the last 
5 years, with strong demand for properties 
priced at `2 Crore or higher. This shift in 
mix towards premium and luxury segment, 
clubbed with robust sales momentum has 
translated into significant surge in housing 
prices. Capital Values have maintained 
a consistent upward trajectory since the 
residential sector’s resurgence in 2021. 
Uptrend in the average residential prices 
within NCR, surpassing those of prominent 
Tier-1 cities across India underscoring the 
robust growth of the real estate sector in

destination for residential investment.
Stepping into 2024 we anticipate this 
positive sentiment to remain buoyant, as 
both sales and launch activity will likely 
exhibit sustained momentum witnessed 
over the last two years. Several factor such 
as burgeoning economic growth, sustained 
urbanisation, and renewed interest from 
investors, millennials shifting trend of 
from rent to buy are expected to fuel a 
robust performance in 2024. With shifting 
consumption patterns, including hybrid 
work culture, demand for ecosystem of co-
located amenities and generous spaces, 
location is no longer the single most 
important factor when making a home 
purchase decision. Factors such as large 
homes with flexibility in configurations, 
ancillary amenities and overall experience 
are likely to remain key focus areas.

differentiator in real estate developments,

Traction in Commercial Real Estate Back 
to Pre-Covid Levels 
The office absorption witnessed a growth 
of 11% YoY, reaching 6414  Mn sq ft making it 
the second highest annual leasing activity 
since 2019. India is leading the Return-to-
Office phenomenon with office utilization 
levels (~70%) being higher than other 
countries US (~45%), Europe (~ 40%) and 
Asia Pacific (~69%) in 2023. During 2023

become broad-based in terms of sectoral 
mix with a significant surge in domestic 
demand in line with India’s growing stature 
in the global economy.

India’s office market is expected to remain 
positive in 2024, despite global economic 
concerns. Occupiers would prioritize high 
quality office space for expanding and 
consolidating their office space while 
pursuing cost efficiency. Global Capability 
Centers (GCCs) are expected to maintain 
their dominant share of leasing at 35-40% 
driven by expansion of existing operations 
and entry of smaller firms that are buoyed 
by India’s value proposition. 
India’s office leasing is predicted to exceed 
6515  million square feet in 2024, setting 
the stage for a historic milestone in the 
country’s commercial real estate market.

Consolidated revenue and EBITDA for 
Max Estates was down by 13% and 19% 
amounting to `929 Mn and `451 Mn

income will be accounted at the time of 
transfer of possession. Total lease rental 
income (Max Towers, Max House and Max 
Square) up by 37% on year-on year basis 
to `661 Mn in FY 24. While revenue from 
leasing has increased, there has been a 
year-on-year decline in overall revenue. This

Progress against key pillars to enable 
execution at scale
Growth: Max Estates has built well-
diversified Commercial and Residential 
Real Estate portfolio across Delhi NCR 
at scale. After successful commercial 
developments in Delhi and Noida, the 
Company expanded its footprint to the 
residential developments along with 
entry into the Gurgaon real estate market 
in commercial as well as residential 
segments. The Company is looking to 
accelerate its growth journey by building 
on its current portfolio spanning 12 Mn. Sq. 
Ft. and adding at least 3 Mn Sq. Ft. each 
year across commercial and residential 
portfolio. In priority, the plan is to look for 
growth in residential real estate market in 
NCR with an eye on strategic commercial 
growth opportunities. 
Capital: With focus on two asset classes, 
the Company intends to efficiently 
allocate capital between the two while 
ensuring that a well-diversified portfolio 
in terms of footprint is developed. We 
intend to implement this within Delhi-
NCR, including business models that are 
outright purchase and joint developments. 
We plan to use equity to purchase land 
and use debt to fund construction related 
expenditures as needed. Our endeavour 
will be to maintain our debt-to-equity ratio, 
in line with this strategy, we will explore 
opportunities to raise additional equity 
to support our growth aspirations at the 
appropriate time in the near future. 
Since inception, the Company has raised 
`3,400 Cr+ of Capital including equity and 
debt. Further, to continue our asset-light 
approach and diversify capital exposure, we 
will continue to bring in equity partners as 
While maintaining  
a lean corporate set-up,

real estate portfolios.

as a capital light approach to secure land. 
Execution: Our existing assets, Max Towers 
and Max House are fully leased at 25-30% 
premium to micro-market to leading 
domestic and multinational companies 
well diversified across sectors. Max Square, 
our latest commercial project in Noida, 
was built in 30 months and is 60%+ leased. 
We delivered Max House Phase-II in Q3 
FY 24 and were able to lease 90%+ of its 
area at 60% higher rentals than the micro 
market within a span of 6 months. We 
are deeply committed to our key pillars of 
execution: people, process, sustainability, 
digital innovation, and customer centricity. 
By continuously focusing on and investing 
in these areas, we will be able to scale 
our operations across micro markets, 
ensuring timely project execution, 
quality construction, efficient project 
management, and prioritized customer 
satisfaction.
The Company has 
proven its capability  
on design-led 
differentiation with  
its assets and is fast 
establishing itself  
as a leading real estate 
brand that caters  
to the holistic needs  
of both businesses  
and individuals, with  
a focus on promoting 
well-being and 
sustainable lifestyles.
Customer Experience: At Max Estates, 
we’ve paid close attention to creating 
a unique confluence of spaces that 
enable collaboration, innovation, and 
community, that are not just functional 
and aesthetically pleasing, but also 
environmentally sustainable, and designed 
to promote the holistic wellbeing of our 
users. Guided by our philosophy of WorkWell 
and LiveWell, we create differentiated 
working and living experiences by moving 
beyond the conventional separation of 
work, life, and well-being, and paying 
attention to the entire spectrum of 
wellbeing across physical, emotional, 
social, and environmental aspects. Our 
developments personify our wellbeing 
orientation and bring our LiveWell and 
WorkWell philosophy to life.

Our focus on LiveWell and WorkWell 
is anchored around 5 pillars – food & 
nutrition, sustainability, community 
culture & hospitality, nature - biophilia, 
health & wellness and intentional design. 
For instance, we believe in incorporating 
nature as an active participant in our 
design, to allow for periods of relaxation 
& escape from the hustle of everyday life. 
As an illustration, the ~11,000 sq. ft. central 
forest courtyard at the heart of Max Square, 
our latest commercial development, is 
a testament to our biophilic design and 
philosophy.
Our in-house engagement vertical, Pulse, 
breathes life into our buildings by curating 
a collection of events and activities that 
nurture occupants to be healthier and 
happier. 
People: To enable execution at scale, the 
Company has significantly upgraded 
its bandwidth and capability over the 
last 12 months, focusing on attracting 
top quality talent, particularly to build 
its residential vertical. The focus has 
been to on-board talent with requisite 
experience with a good mix of real 
estate and non-real estate for each 
domain across real estate value chain 
with emphasis on a culture of working 
together as a team in cross functional 
setting to deliver a superior product and 
experience. We have onboarded 90+ 
experienced professionals commensurate 
to requirements of expanded real estate 
portfolio. We will continue to invest in 
building organizational capacity, including 
leadership bandwidth in cohesion with the 
scale and scope of our current and aspired 
RE portfolios. We place a strong emphasis 
on learning and development, conducting 
a wide range of L&D interventions that 
encompass both soft and hard skills. 
Our comprehensive approach includes 
short and long-term programs, executive 
education, as well as role-specific and

Process: Several strategic initiatives have 
been undertaken to strengthen systems 
and processes. As an illustration, we 
have identified 13 verticals across the 
real estate value chain wherein we are 
institutionalising internal processes to 
enable seamless execution at scale with 
help of external advisors. The SOPs thus 
created after thorough gap analysis are 
stress tested through internal audit to 
ensure implementation. 
ESG elements such as reduction of 
carbon emissions, use of sustainable 
materials, energy efficiency and wellbeing 
enhancements are becoming important 
for both occupiers as well the Capital 
Provider for Real Estate. With our first 
Sustainability Report in 2021, we have 
officially embarked on a long journey to 
make our commitment to sustainability 
a key differentiator within the real estate 
market. We continued to embrace ESG 
best practices across the organization, with 
participation in GRESB ranking this year 
for the 2nd time and were able to achieve a 
GRESB 4-star rating which considering our 
relatively small history places us amongst 
the top developers in the country. We pride 
ourselves in having high target in this 
domain and aim to achieve a 5-star rating 
in GRESB 2024. 
While we have onboarded several digital 
tools across value chain including BIM, 
SFDC, SAP, Wobot, Clairco, Smart Joules, 
Zykrr, Reloy, Ozontel and many others to 
improve operational efficiency, optimize 
cost and enhance customer experience. We 
have developed a 3-year Digital Road map 
with help of an external advisor to start 
embedding Digital interventions as we 
execute at scale. 
Max Estates is committed to leading the 
real estate industry in climate action. By 
adhering to Net Zero Policy, we intend to 
significantly reduce our carbon footprint 
and contribute to India’s Net Zero target. 
Risk: The Company has formalized ‘Risk 
Register’, which identifies and rates 
risk parameters as well as tracks it with 
focus actions required to mitigate it. The 
Risk Register today captures risk across 
7 buckets including macroeconomic, 
business, regulatory, brand, capital, 
people, technology; And, for each risk, the 
Company rates it into four categories – 
ESG elements such as 
reduction of carbon 
emissions, use of 
sustainable materials, 
energy efficiency and 
wellbeing 
enhancements are 
becoming important for 
both occupiers as well

practical guidelines, various checklists, 
and tips to help teachers understand 
and review their preparedness, including 
their individual pedagogical style. The 
Pack is available in both English and 
Hindi languages. Some international SEE

least one Board meeting is held within 45 days from the close of each 
quarter to review financial results and business performance and the 
gap between two Board meetings does not exceed the time gap as 
prescribed under the law from time to time. 
Apart from the aforesaid four quarterly meetings, additional Board 
meetings are also convened to meet business exigencies, as 
required. Matters of exigency are approved by the Directors through 
resolutions passed by circulation, as permissible under the provisions 
of the Companies Act, 2013 and Secretarial Standard-1. 
Meetings of the Committees of the Board are generally held prior to 
the Board meeting. The Chairpersons of the respective Committees 
brief the Board about the proceedings of the Committee meetings 
and its recommendations on matters that the Board needs to 
consider and approve. 
All Agenda items are accompanied by comprehensive notes on the 
related subject and in certain areas such as business plans/business 
reviews and financial results, detailed presentations are made to the 
Board members. The materials for the Board and Committee meetings 
are generally circulated (electronically in a secure dedicated portal).

Key initiatives undertaken during FY2023-24:

To build a robust talent pipeline, we launched the ‘Young 
Business Leaders Program (YBLP)’, to hire young and fresh talent 
from campuses and groom them into future leaders in real estate 
industry. We have been running this program for the last 3 years 
and hired fresh talent from premier business schools. We are also 
replicating this approach for young talent out of engineering 
and architecture colleges.

	We also initiated the second edition of our internal leadership 
development program for high potential talent called ‘MEL 
NEXT’. Under this program, we identify critical talent based role, 
performance on the job and potential. We have hired external 
experts to take them through one year program aimed at 
grooming them into potential future leaders. This will also enable 
us to build a succession pipeline.

We have initiated the implementation of the ‘WórkWell’ 
philosophy for employees across locations. This philosophy aims 
to enable holistic well-being of employees through a nurturing 
work environment, safe and ergonomic workplace, emotional 
support, amenities, and health and nutrition program.

	To listen to our employees and understand their needs and 
aspirations at a deeper level, we have engaged an independent 
agency to seek feedback from employees on relevant parameters 
including credibility, respect, fairness, workplace camaraderie, 
opportunities for learning and career growth, and workplace 
wellbeing. This will further enable us to design our policies and 
initiatives centred around employee needs. This feedback will 
also help us further enhance our existing initiatives.

	Since inception, our endeavour has been to nurture and build 
a learning oriented organization. We have a two-pronged 
approach to the learning and development of our employees. 
Our approach to Learning need analysis is a unique blend 
of bottom-up and top-down approaches, factoring in both 
organisational capability requirements and the learning needs 
of individual employees. Over the last few years, we have 
covered 100% of employees under our Learning & Development 
program through group and individual-centric interventions. 
We are looking to augment in further by bringing in digital 
interventions and self-paced learning to help employees keep 
upgrading their skill sets on an ongoing basis.

	At Max Estates, we intend to build a performance-oriented culture. 
We have implemented the new Performance Enhancement 
Process (PEP), which is more development focused rather than 
assessment focused. Under PEP, we have successfully trained 
all people managers in giving effective development feedback 
to their team members on a continuous basis and also trained 
the team members in giving reverse feedback to their managers 
while also equipping them to articulate their needs effectively. 
This will enable us to crate a transparent and development 
centric culture across the organization.

Dear Stakeholders,
At Max Estates, our mission to “enhance the quality of life through 
the spaces we create” is more than just rhetoric—it’s the driving force 
behind everything we do. As a leading real estate player in Delhi NCR, 
we recognize the pivotal role we play in shaping sustainable urban 
environments and positively impacting the lives of our stakeholders. 
From the outset, sustainability has been woven into the fabric of 
our organization. We understand the urgency of addressing climate 
change and environmental degradation, which is why we’ve em-
barked on a steadfast journey towards sustainability. Our actions are 
aligned with the global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), as we 
endeavor to set a new standard for responsible development in the 
real estate sector. 
Our approach to sustainability is comprehensive and dynamic. We’ve 
implemented robust measures to boost energy efficiency and opti-
mize resource utilization across all our projects. For instance, Estate 
128 in Noida stands as a testament to our commitment to green 
building practices, boasting an IGBC Platinum Pre-Certification. Sim-
ilarly, our upcoming project in Gurugram, Estate 360 is poised to 
achieve IGBC Platinum certification as well, showcasing our unwav-
ering dedication to sustainable development. 
At the heart of our sustainability strategy lies the seamless integration 
of nature into our built environment. We prioritize green spaces and 
innovative landscape designs to foster well-being and combat the 
adverse effects of urbanization. Estate 128, with its sprawling green 
cover comprising over 70% of the development, epitomizes our 
pledge to creating thriving and healthy communities. 
We believe in championing a sustainable lifestyle for residents of 
Estate 128 through waste segregation at source, minimizing landfill 
waste, and an organic waste converter system for responsible reuse, 
promoting a greener future for residents. 
Water conservation is another cornerstone of our sustainability agen-
da. Recognizing the water challenges faced by urban centers like Del-
hi NCR, we’ve embraced innovative solutions such as sourcing water 
from sewage treatment plants and implementing on-site treatment 
measures to curb groundwater depletion during construction activi-
ties. At our commercial development, Max Square, we have been able 
to achieve a zero waste water discharge facility owing to our water 
conservation interventions. 
In our unwavering commitment to transparency and accountability, 
we’ve published a Sustainability Report & our inaugural BRSR report, 
offering insights into our progress and future aspirations. Moreover, 
we’ve embraced global standards like GRESB to benchmark our per-
formance and drive continuous improvement in our environmental, 
social, and governance (ESG) practices. 
Since 2021, we have been on a structured ESG journey, delineating 
short-term, medium-term, and long-term goals to drive sustainable 
development. Having successfully achieved our medium-term ob-
jectives, we have undertaken a comprehensive review to refine and 
prioritize our ESG goals for FY25. These goals include: 
• 
Implementing Integrated Management Systems (IMS) standards 
within our operational assets. 
• 
Initiating the upgrade of the Gurgaon 65 project to LEED Plati-
num certification. 
• 
Pursuing LEED Operations & Maintenance (O&M) certification for 
Max Towers. 
• 
Leveraging rating agencies such as GRESB to drive continuous 
improvement. 
• 
Seeking WELL Health & Safety ratings for our operational assets. 
• 
Life Cycle Embodied Carbon Analysis for Max Towers. 
These specific and measurable goals underscore our dedication to 
advancing sustainability across all facets of our operations, from en-
vironmental stewardship to social responsibility and governance. By 
aligning our actions with these targets, we aim to strengthen our po-
sition as a leader in sustainable real estate development and create 
lasting value for our stakeholders.

well-maintained contemporary office complexes that offer better employee well-being, sustainable outlook, and the best of amenities, 
which are suited to the future of work in the new normal. Aligning with the market trend and the need of the hour, we have built 
offices with a host of amenities, and allocated dedicated areas for flexible workspace solutions across our assets. This has allowed us 
to be the preferred choice for tenants that are looking to occupy Grade A+ commercial office spaces in Delhi NCR. Our developments 
are now synonymous with quality and have enjoyed a surge in leasing demand from a set of reputed and diverse clientele, thereby 
commanding premium rentals across various micro markets. Our occupants belong to a varied set of industries including professional 
services, media, financial services, IT/ITES, real estate related businesses, manufacturing, etc.

2. 
a.   Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)
 
Yes, Max Estates continues to uphold its commitment to sustainable sourcing, in line with the company’s enduring vision and 
corporate policies for sustainable development within the real estate sector. Our practices remain steadfast in adherence to pertinent 
environmental regulations while continually assessing the viability of low-carbon structural and non-structural materials. We actively 
explore advancements in modular construction technology and prioritize minimizing and recycling construction demolition waste.
	
Furthermore, we maintain strict standards, ensuring all suppliers, manufacturers, and contractors comply with health, safety, and 
environmental legislation. Max Estates adamantly opposes the use of forced, bonded, or child labour throughout its supply chain. 
Moreover, we foster collaborative relationships with suppliers to encourage continuous product improvements and mitigate any 
adverse impacts on the environment.
b.   If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?
	
Max Estates mandates that all its developments are at least LEED/IGBC Gold certified and with this overarching commitment, we are 
committed to following the guidelines set forth by LEED/IGBC for material usage in sustainable buildings. For example, only low-VOC 
paints are used in our assets which aligns with LEED/IGBC guidelines

Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of life, for (a) 
Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) H azardous waste and (d) other waste.
	
Like any other real estate development organization, Max Estates’ assets have a very long life span, at least 50 years. Not only are the assets 
of the highest quality, but they are also LEED and IGBC-certified buildings with a minimum rating of Gold. Having not reached the latter end 
of the lifecycle of our assets, we can consider this to be done later.

Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) does not apply to Real Estate Development organisations. Max Estates Limited ensures that waste 
generated during operations and maintenance of its assets is duly treated, recycled, and disposed of as per regulatory requirements.

Yes. Our Health and Safety manual for projects applies to all those individuals operating at the project sites. Further, each project 
site may present unique situations. The site safety plans are developed and deployed by the vendor/contractor to address such 
unique concerns. A site safety management committee monitors the implementation of each and every safety plan. Periodic internal 
and external safety audits are carried out to ensure adherence to all safety guidelines. Any safety gap, incident, and operational 
improvement are communicated to the site safety committee and the corporate safety team. The learnings from each site are recorded 
at the corporate level and included in the safety instruction manual. These safety instructions are also clearly displayed at the site 
through various signages. The message conveyed through these signages is in both Hindi and English language. We have applied for 
occupation & health safety certification (ISO45001) which should be in place by December 2024.

1. 
Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity.
	
Max Estates Limited has conducted a thorough assessment to identify its critical stakeholders, categorizing them into primary and secondary 
groups based on priority. Primary stakeholders encompass investors, employees, tenants, suppliers, and contractors, while secondary 
stakeholders comprise local and regional communities, government entities, and media outlets. Both primary and secondary stakeholders 
play integral roles in the company’s growth, offering support both financially and strategically.
	
This stakeholder mapping initiative has provided Max Estates Limited with invaluable insights into the identities of its key stakeholders and 
their respective expectations regarding the business. The selection criteria for primary and secondary stakeholders were based on their 
direct or indirect dependence on Max Estates Limited’s activities, real estate portfolio, services, performance, or influence on the company’s 
strategic and operational decision-making processes.
	
To facilitate organizational learning and enhance decision-making, a cross-functional team consisting of members with expertise in finance, 
law, operations, and management was assembled. This team conducted a materiality assessment to gain deeper insights, enabling Max 
Estates Limited to make more informed decisions.
	
Moreover, we maintain regular engagement with our stakeholders through various modes of communication. Recognizing that each 
stakeholder group harbors distinct expectations, we tailor our engagement efforts to address topics of relevance to each group.

Community Development Programs: We go beyond just neighbouring communities. We partner with local NGOs and organizations

Max Estates prioritizes responsible development. While formal Social Impact Assessments (SIAs) weren't required for projects in the 
current year, we:
• 
Engage Communities: Actively engage potentially affected communities through open communication and seeking feedback.
• 
Focus on Sustainability: Integrate environmentally and socially responsible practices throughout development.
Currently, SIAs are conducted internally. We continuously evaluate our approach and are exploring opportunities to involve independent 
external agencies for comprehensive SIAs in the future.

3. 
Describe the mechanisms to receive and redress grievances of the community.
	
At Max Estates, we firmly believe that the ecosystem & community around our assets is as important as the asset itself. Through interactions 
with the neighbouring communities, we collect feedback to enhance the ecosystem around our assets and uplift the lives of our local 
communities. Some examples of such initiatives for the community near Max Towers are our efforts to establish a foot-over bridge in front 
of Max Towers for safe & more accessible commute for the local community, working towards cleaning and sanitation near the open sewer 
near Max Towers to enhance the health & wellbeing of the community. Similarly, at Max House, Okhla, we have been actively working 
with a residential colony adjacent to the asset to provide them with efficient sewage treatment. We are also looking to clean up & beautify 
the area under the flyover near Max House to increase the safety & security of the local community. We have also started planning for the 
development of a green belt/ area in front of Max Towers and Max Square. This is aligned with our effort to uplift the overall hygiene and 
health of communities around our developments.

To the Members of Max Estates Limited
Report on the A udit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements 
of Max Estates Limited (“the Company”), which comprise the Balance 
sheet as at March 31 2024, the Statement of Profit and Loss, including 
the statement of Other Comprehensive Income, the Cash Flow 
Statement and the Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then 
ended, and notes to the standalone financial statements, including 
a summary of material accounting policies and other explanatory 
information.
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according 
to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial 
statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 
2013, as amended (“the Act”) in the manner so required and give 
a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles 
generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as 
at March 31, 2024, its profit including other comprehensive loss, its 
cashflows and the changes in equity for the year ended on that date.
Basis for O pinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in 
accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs), as specified under 
section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards 
are further described in the ‘Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of 
the Standalone Financial Statements’ section of our report. We are 
independent of the Company in accordance with the ‘Code of Ethics’ 
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together 
with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules 
thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities 
in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We 
believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the standalone 
financial statements.
Key A udit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, 
were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial 
statements for the financial year ended March 31, 2024. These matters 
were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we 
do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter 
below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is 
provided in that context.
We have determined the matters described below to be the key 
audit matters to be communicated in our report. We have fulfilled 
the responsibilities described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for 
the audit of the standalone financial statements section of our 
report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit 
included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the standalone 
financial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including 
the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the 
basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying standalone financial 
statements.

investments by reference to the 
requirements under Ind AS 36 
"Impairment of Assets".
Further, the Company has 
loans and advances given 
its subsidiaries,  which are 
assessed for recoverability 
thereof.
The  assessment is  driven 
by various  internal and 
external 
factors 
including 
but not limited to business 
performance,        financial 
condition,        external 
environment/development 
impacting   the   respective 
business.
In view of significance of the 
amount involved and factors 
which  require judgement, 
this  matter was determined 
to be a key audit matter 
in our audit of standalone 
financial statements.
• We assessed the compliance 
of 
Company's 
accounting 
policies for impairment of 
investments with Ind AS 36 
'Impairment of Assets' and 
recoverability of loans and 
advances    with    Ind    AS 
109    'Financial instruments'.
• We understood, evaluated 
and tested the operating 
effectiveness 
of 
related 
internal controls implemented 
by the Company.
• We    assessed    and 
performed    procedures    for 
impairment indicator and 
recoverability 
assessment

statements 
regarding   such  investments, 
loans and advances.
Other I nformation
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the other 
information. The other information comprises the information 
included in the Board’s Report, but does not include the standalone

financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not cover 
the other information and we do not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the standalone financial statements, 
our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether such other information is materially inconsistent 
with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the 
audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on 
the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material 
misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that 
fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of Management for the Standalone Financial 
Statements
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters 
stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation 
of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair 
view of the financial position, financial performance including 
other comprehensive income, cashflows and changes in equity 
of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles 
generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting 
Standards (Ind AS) specified under section 133 of the Act read 
with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as 
amended. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate 
accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for 
safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and 
detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of 
appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates 
that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation 
and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were 
operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of 
the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation 
of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view 
and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or 
error.
In preparing the standalone financial statements, management 
is responsible for assessing the Company’ s ability to continue as a 
going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless 
management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease 
operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
Those Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the 
Company’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s R
esponsibilities for the A
udit of the Standalone 
Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the standalone financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s 
report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high 
level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted 
in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users 
taken on the basis of these standalone financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional 
judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the 
audit. We also:
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone 
financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and 
perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit 
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting 
from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may 
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, 
or the override of internal control.
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit 
in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also 
responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company 
has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the 
reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures 
made by management.
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going 
concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence 
obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events 
or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material 
uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s 
report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such 
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions 
are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our 
auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the 
Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the 
standalone financial statements, including the disclosures, and 
whether the standalone financial statements represent the underlying 
transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, 
among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit 
178 | Annual Report 2023-24
Strategic Review

Financial Review
and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in 
internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement 
that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding 
independence, and to communicate with them all relationships 
and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the standalone financial statements for the 
financial year ended March 31,2024 and are therefore the key audit 
matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law 
or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in 
extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not 
be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences 
of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public 
interest benefits of such communication.

We have audited the internal financial controls with reference 
to standalone financial statements of Max Estates Limited (“the 
Company”) as of March 31, 2024 in conjunction with our audit of the 
standalone financial statements of the Company for the year ended 
on that date.
Management’s R esponsibility for I nternal Financial Controls
The Company’s Management is responsible for establishing and 
maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control 
over financial reporting criteria established by the Company 
considering the essential components of internal control stated in the 
Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial 
Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India 
(“ICAI”). These responsibilities include the design, implementation 
and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were 
operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct 
of its business, including adherence to the Company’s policies, the 
safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and 
errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and 
the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required 
under the Companies Act, 2013.
Auditor’s R esponsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal 
financial controls with reference to these standalone financial 
statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance 
with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over 
Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) and the Standards on 
Auditing, as specified under section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent 
applicable to an audit of internal financial controls, both issued by 
ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply 
with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial 
controls with reference to these standalone financial statements was 
established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively 
in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence 
about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference 
to these standalone financial statements and their operating 
effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to 
standalone financial statements included obtaining an understanding 
of internal financial controls with reference to these standalone 
financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, 
and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of 
internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected 
depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the 
risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether 
due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company’s 
internal financial controls with reference to these standalone financial 
statements.
Meaning of I nternal Financial Controls With R eference to these 
Standalone Financial Statements
A company’s internal financial controls with reference to standalone 
financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable 
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the 
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal 
financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements 
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the 
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and 
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the 
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are 
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and 
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only 
in accordance with authorisations of management and directors 
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding 
prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or 
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect 
on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of I nternal Financial Controls with 
Reference to Standalone Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with 
reference to standalone financial statements, including the possibility 
of collusion or improper management override of controls, material 
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls 
with reference to standalone financial statements to future periods 
are subject to the risk that the internal financial control with reference 
to standalone financial statements may become inadequate because 
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the 
policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, adequate 
internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial 
statements and such internal financial controls with reference to 
standalone financial statements were operating effectively as at 
March 31, 2024, based on the internal control over financial reporting 
criteria established by the Company considering the essential 
components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note issued 
by the ICAI.

2B Summary of accounting policies
a. 
Current versus non-current classification
	
The Company presents assets and liabilities in the balance 
sheet based on current/ non-current classification. An asset 
is treated as current when it is:
a)	
Expected to be realized or intended to be sold or 
consumed in normal operating cycle;
b)	
Held primarily for the purpose of trading;
c)	
Expected to be realized within twelve months after the 
reporting period; or

Financial Review
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-
current assets and liabilities.
	
The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition of 
assets for processing and their realization in cash and cash 
equivalents. The Company has identified twelve months as 
its operating cycle.
b. 
Business Combinations
	
Common 
control 
business 
combinations 
include 
transactions, such as transfer of subsidiaries or businesses, 
between entities within a Company. Business combinations 
involving entities or businesses under common control are 
accounted for using the pooling of interests method. The 
pooling of interest method is considered to involve the 
following: 
(i)	
The assets and liabilities of the combining entities are 
reflected at their carrying amounts. 
(ii)	 No adjustments are made to reflect fair values, or 
recognise any new assets or liabilities. The only 
adjustments that are made are to harmonise 
accounting policies. 
(iii)	 The financial information in the financial statements 
in respect of prior periods is restated as if the business 
combination had occurred from the beginning of 
the preceding period in the financial statements, 
irrespective of the actual date of the combination. 
However, if business combination had occurred after 
that date, the prior period information shall be restated 
only from that date. 
(iv)	 The balance of the retained earnings appearing in the 
financial statements of the transferor is aggregated 
with the corresponding balance appearing in the 
financial statements of the transferee.
c. 
Property, Plant and Equipment
	
Property, Plant and equipment including capital work in 
progress are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation 
and accumulated impairment losses, if any. The cost 
comprises of purchase price, taxes, duties, freight and 
other incidental expenses directly attributable and related 
to acquisition and installation of the concerned assets and 
are further adjusted by the amount of GST credit availed 
wherever applicable. When significant parts of plant and 
equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the 
Company depreciates them separately based on their 
respective useful lives. Likewise, when a major inspection is 
performed, its cost is recognized in the carrying amount of 
the plant and equipment as a replacement if the recognition 
criteria are satisfied. All other repair and maintenance costs 
are recognized in profit or loss as incurred.
	
An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant 
part initially recognized is derecognized upon disposal or 
when no future economic benefits are expected from its 
use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition 
of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net 
disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) 
is included in the income statement when the asset is 
derecognized.
	
The Company identifies and determines cost of each 
component/ part of the asset separately, if the component/ 
part has a cost which is significant to the total cost of the 
asset and has useful life that is materially different from that 
of the remaining asset.
	
Capital work- in- progress includes cost of property, plant 
and equipment under installation / under development as 
at the balance sheet date.
	
The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation 
of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each 
financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.
	
Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is provided 
on pro rata basis on straight-line method using the useful 
lives of the assets estimated by management and in the 
manner prescribed in Schedule II of the Companies Act 
2013. The useful life is as follows:
Assets
Useful lives estimated by the 
management (years)
Furniture and fixtures
10 Years
Office equipment
5 Years
Computers
6 Years
Vehicles
8 Years
	
Leasehold improvements are amortised over the period of 
lease.
d.  Investment Property
 
Recognition and initial measurement:
	
Investment properties are properties held to earn rentals 
or for capital appreciation or both. Investment properties 
are measured initially at their cost of acquisition including 
transaction costs The cost comprises purchase price, 
borrowing cost, if capitalization criteria are met and directly 
attributable cost of bringing the asset to its working 
condition for the intended use. Any trade discount and 
rebates are deducted in arriving at the purchase price When 
significant parts of the investment property are required to

be replaced at intervals, the Company depreciates them 
separately based on their specific useful lives.
	
Property held under lease is classified as investment 
property when it is held to earn rentals or for capital 
appreciation or for both, rather than for sale in the ordinary 
course of business or for use in production or administrative 
functions. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s 
carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as 
appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic 
benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group 
All other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in 
statement of profit and loss as incurred The cost includes 
the cost of replacing parts and borrowing costs for long-
term construction projects if the recognition criteria are 
met When significant parts of the investment property are 
required to be replaced at intervals, the Group depreciates 
them separately based on their specific useful lives All other 
repair and maintenance costs are recognised in profit or loss 
as incurred.
	
Depreciation on investment properties is provided on the 
straight-line method, over the useful lives of the assets are 
as follows:
Asset category’
Estimated life 
Buildings and related equipment
15 to 60
Plant & Machinery & other equipment
6 to 10
	
Estimated useful life of Leasehold land is over the period of 
lease.
	
Though the Company measures investment property using 
cost-based measurement, the fair value of investment 
properly is disclosed in the notes Fair values are determined 
based on an annual evaluation performed by the company 
applying a valuation model acceptable.
 
De-recognition
	
Investment properties are de-recognised either when they 
have been disposed of or when they are permanently 
withdrawn from use and no future economic benefit is 
expected from their disposal. The difference between the 
net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset 
is recognised in statement of profit and loss in the period of 
de-recognition.
	
Depreciation on investment property has been provided on 
straight line method over the useful life of assets Useful life 
of assets are as under:
Asset category’
Estimated life 
Buildings and related equipment
15 to 60 years
Plant & machinery, furniture & 
fixtures and other equipments
6 to 10 years
e. 
Intangible assets
	
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial 
recognition at cost. Following initial recognition, intangible 
assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and 
accumulated impairment losses, if any. Internally generated 
intangibles, excluding capitalized development cost, are 
not capitalized and the related expenditure is reflected 
in statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which the 
expenditure is incurred. Cost comprises the purchase price 
and any attributable cost of bringing the asset to its working 
condition for its intended use.
	
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either 
finite or indefinite. Intangible assets with finite lives are 
amortized over their useful economic lives and assessed 
for impairment whenever there is an indication that the 
intangible asset may be impaired. The amortization period 
and the amortization method for an intangible asset 
with a finite useful life is reviewed at least at the end of 
each reporting period. Changes in the expected useful 
life or the expected pattern of consumption of future 
economic benefits embodied in the asset is accounted 
for by changing the amortization period or method, as 
appropriate and are treated as changes in accounting 
estimates. The amortization expense on intangible assets 
with finite lives is recognized in the statement of profit and 
loss in the expense category consistent with the function of 
the intangible assets.
	
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not 
amortized, but are tested for impairment annually, 
either individually or at the cash-generating unit level. 
The assessment of indefinite life is reviewed annually to 
determine whether the indefinite life continues to be 
supportable. If not, the change in useful life from indefinite 
to finite is made on a prospective basis.
	
Gains or losses arising from disposal of the intangible assets 
are measured as the difference between the net disposal 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are 
recognized in the statement of profit and loss when the 
assets are disposed-off.
	
Intangible assets with finite useful life are amortized on a 
straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of 3-6 
years.

f. 
Impairment of non-financial assets
	
The Company assesses at each reporting date whether 
there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any 
indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for 
an asset is required, the Company estimates the asset’s, 
recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is 
the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s (CGU) 
net fair value less cost of disposal and its value in use. The 
recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, 
unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are 
largely independent of those from other assets or groups of 
assets. Where the carrying amount of asset or CGU exceeds 
its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired 
and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing 
value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted 
to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of 
money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining net 
fair value less cost of disposal, recent market transactions 
are taken into account, if available. If no such transactions 
can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used. 
These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, 
quoted share prices for publicly traded companies or other 
available fair value indicators.
	
The Company bases its impairment calculation on detailed 
budgets and forecast calculations which are prepared 
separately for each of the Company’s cash-generating units 
to which the individual assets are allocated. These budgets 
and forecast calculations are generally covering a period 
of five years. For the remaining economic life of the asset 
or cash-generating unit (CGU), a long term growth rate is 
calculated and applied to project future cash flows after 
the fifth year. To estimate cash flow projections beyond 
periods covered by the most recent budgets/forecasts, the 
Company extrapolates cash flow projections in the budget 
using a steady or declining growth rate for subsequent 
years, unless an increasing rate can be justified. In this case, 
the growth rate does not exceed the long-term average 
growth rate for the products, industries, or country or 
countries in which the entity operates, or for the market in 
which the asset is used.
	
After impairment, depreciation is provided on the revised 
carrying amount of the asset over its remaining economic 
life.
	
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to 
whether there is any indication that previously recognized 
impairment losses no longer exist or may have decreased. 
If such indication exists, the Company estimates the asset’s 
or cash-generating unit’s recoverable amount. A previously 
recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there has 
been a change in the assumptions used to determine the 
asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss 
was recognized. The reversal is limited so that the carrying 
amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable 
amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have 
been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment 
loss been recognized for the asset in prior years. Such 
reversal is recognized in the statement of profit and loss 
unless the asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which 
case the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase.
g. 
Financial I nstruments
	
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a 
financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity 
instrument of another entity.
(i) Financial assets
	
The Company classified its financial assets in the 
following measurement categories: -
-	
Those to be measured subsequently at fair value 
(either through other comprehensive income or 
through profit & loss)
-	
Those measured at amortized cost
 
Initial recognition and measurement
	
All financial assets (other than equity in subsidiaries) 
are recognized initially at fair value plus, in the case of 
financial assets not recorded at fair value through profit 
or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the 
acquisition of the financial asset. Equity investment in 
subsidiaries are recognised at cost. Purchases or sales 
of financial assets that require delivery of assets within 
a time frame established by regulation or convention 
in the market place (regular way trades) are recognized 
on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Company 
commits to purchase or sell the asset. The difference 
between the transaction amount and amortised cost 
in case of interest free loan to subsidiaries based on 
expected repayment period is considered as deemed 
investment.
 
Subsequent measurement
	
For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial 
assets are classified in following categories:
a)	
Debt instruments at amortized cost
Annual Report 2023-24 | 193 
Strategic Review
Corporate  Review
Financial Review
b)	
Debt instruments and equity instruments at fair 
value through profit or loss (FVTPL)
 
Debt instruments at amortized cost
	
A ‘debt instrument’ is measured at the amortized cost if 
both the following conditions are met:
(i) Business model test: The asset is held within a 
business model whose objective is to hold assets 
for collecting contractual cash flows (rather than 
to sell the instrument prior to its contractual 
maturity to released its fair value change), and
(ii) 	 Cash flow characteristics test: Contractual terms of 
the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows 
that are solely payments of principal and interest 
(SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.
	
After initial measurement, such financial assets are 
subsequently measured at amortized cost using the 
effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortized cost 
is calculated by taking into account any discount or 
premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are 
an integral part of the EIR. EIR is the rate that exactly 
discount the estimated future cash receipts over the 
expected life of the financial instrument or a shorter 
period, where appropriate to the gross carrying amount 
of financial assets. When calculating the effective 
interest rate the company estimate the expected 
cash flow by considering all contractual terms of the 
financial instruments. The EIR amortization is included 
in finance income in the statement of profit or loss. The 
losses arising from impairment are recognized in the 
profit or loss. This category generally applies to trade 
and other receivables.
 
Debt instruments at Fair value through profit and 
loss
	
FVTPL is a residual category for financial instruments. 
Any financial instrument, which does not meet the 
criteria for amortized cost or FVTOCI, is classified as 
at FVTPL. gain or loss on a Debt instrument that is 
subsequently measured at FVTPL and is not a part of 
a hedging relationship is recognized in statement of 
profit or loss and presented net in the statement of 
profit and loss within other gains or losses in the period 
in which it arises. Interest income from these Debt 
instruments is included in other income.
 
Equity investments of other entities
	
All equity investments in scope of IND AS 109 are 
measured at fair value. Equity instruments which 
are held for trading and contingent consideration 
recognized by an acquirer in a business combination 
to which IND AS103 applies are classified as at FVTPL. 
For all other equity instruments, the Company may 
make an irrevocable election to present in other 
comprehensive income all subsequent changes in 
the fair value. The Company makes such election on 
an instrument-by-instrument basis. The classification is 
made on initial recognition and is irrevocable.
	
If the Company decides to classify an equity instrument 
as at FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on the 
instrument, excluding dividends, are recognized in the 
OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts from OCI to 
profit and loss, even on sale of investment. However, 
the Company may transfer the cumulative gain or 
loss within equity. Equity instruments included within 
the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all 
changes recognized in the Profit and loss.
 
Investment in Compound Financial I nstruments 
issued by subsidiaries
	
Company considers issuance of Zero Coupon Non-
Convertible Debentures by subsidiary as compound 
instrument comprising a loan with market terms and a 
capital injection and hence treat the difference between 
the cash paid and fair value on initial recognition 
as an addition to the investment in the subsidiary 
and presented separately as ‘Equity component of 
Zero Coupon Non-Convertible Debentures under 
‘Non-Current Investments’. Equity Component is not 
subsequently remeasured.
 
Derecognition
	
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a 
financial asset or part of a Company of similar financial 
assets) is primarily derecognized (i.e., removed from 
the Company’s statement of financial position) when:
-	
the rights to receive cash flows from the asset 
have expired, or
-	
the Company has transferred its rights to receive 
cash flows from the asset or has assumed an 
obligation to pay the received cash flows in full 
without material delay to a third party under a 
“pass through” arrangement and either;
a)	
the Company has transferred the rights to 
receive cash flows from the financial assets or

Strategic Review
Corporate  Review
Financial Review
b)	
the Company has retained the contractual 
right to receive the cash flows of the financial 
asset, but assumes a contractual obligation to 
pay the cash flows to one or more recipients.
	
Where the Company has transferred its right to receive 
cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-
through agreement, the Company evaluates whether it 
has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of 
the ownership of the financial assets. In such cases, the 
financial asset is derecognized. Where the entity has 
not transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of 
the ownership of the financial assets, the financial asset 
is not derecognized.
	
Where the Company has transferred an asset, the 
Company evaluates whether it has transferred 
substantially all the risks and rewards of the ownership 
of the financial assets. In such cases, the financial asset 
is derecognized. Where the entity has not transferred 
substantially all the risks and rewards of the ownership 
of the financial assets, the financial asset is not 
derecognized.
 
Impairment of financial assets
	
In accordance with IND AS 109, the Company applies 
expected credit losses (ECL) model for measurement 
and recognition of impairment loss on the following 
financial asset and credit risk exposure.
-	
Financial assets measured at amortised cost; e.g. 
Loans, Security deposits, trade receivable, bank 
balance, other financial assets etc;
-	
Financial assets measured at fair value through 
other comprehensive income (FVTOCI);
-	
Financial guarantee contracts are which are not 
measured at fair value through profit or loss 
(FVTPL)
	
The Company follows “simplified approach” for 
recognition of impairment loss allowance on trade 
receivables. Under the simplified approach, the 
Company does not track changes in credit risk. Rather, 
it recognizes impairment loss allowance based on 
lifetime ECLs at each reporting date, right from its initial 
recognition. The Company uses a provision matrix to 
determine impairment loss allowance on the portfolio 
of trade receivables. The provision matrix is based on 
its historically observed default rates over the expected 
life of trade receivable and is adjusted for estimates. At 
every reporting date, the historical observed default 
rates are updated and changes in the estimates are 
analysed.
	
For recognition of impairment loss on other financial 
assets and risk exposure, the Company determines 
whether there has been a significant increase in the 
credit risk since initial recognition. If  credit risk has 
not increased significantly, 12-month ECL is used to 
provide for impairment loss. 
 
However, if credit risk has increased significantly, 
lifetime ECL is used. If, in subsequent period, credit 
quality of the instrument improves such that there is 
no longer a significant increase in credit risk since initial 
recognition, then the Company reverts to recognizing 
impairment loss allowance based on 12- months ECL.
 
Reclassification of financial assets
	
The Company determines classification of financial 
assets and liabilities on initial recognition. After 
initial recognition, no reclassification is made for 
financial assets which are equity instruments and 
financial liabilities. For financial assets which are debt 
instruments, a reclassification is made only if there is 
a change in the business model for managing those 
assets. Changes to the business model are expected 
to be infrequent. The Company’s senior management 
determines change in the business model as a result 
of external or internal changes which are significant 
to its operations. Such changes are evident to external 
parties. A change in the business model occurs when 
the Company either begins or ceases to perform 
an activity that is significant to its operations. If the 
Company reclassifies financial assets, it applies the 
reclassification prospectively from the reclassification 
date which is the first day of the immediately next 
reporting period following the change in business 
model. The Company does not restate any previously 
recognized gains, losses (including impairment gains 
or losses) or interest.
(ii) Financial liabilities
 
Initial recognition and measurement
	
Financial liabilities are classified at initial recognition 
as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, 
loans and borrowings, and payables, net of directly 
attributable transaction costs. The Company financial 
liabilities include loans and borrowings including bank 
overdraft, trade payable, trade deposits, retention 
money and other payables.
Annual Report 2023-24 | 195 
Strategic Review
Corporate  Review
Financial Review
 
Subsequent measurement
	
The measurement of financial liabilities depends on 
their classification, as described below:
 
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or 
loss
	
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss 
include financial liabilities held for trading and financial 
liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair 
value through profit or loss. Financial liabilities are 
classified as held for trading if they are incurred for 
the purpose of repurchasing in the near term. Gains 
or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised 
in the statement of profit and loss. Financial liabilities 
designated upon initial recognition at fair value 
through profit or loss are designated as such at the 
initial date of recognition, and only if the criteria in IND 
AS 109 are satisfied. For liabilities designated as FVTPL, 
fair value gains/ losses attributable to changes in own 
credit risk are recognised in OCI. These gains/ losses 
are not subsequently transferred to profit and loss. 
However, the Company may transfer the cumulative 
gain or loss within equity. All other changes in fair 
value of such liability are recognised in the statement 
of profit or loss. The Company has not designated any 
financial liability as at fair value through profit and loss.
 
Financial liabilities at amortised cost (Loans and 
borrowings)
	
Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net 
of transaction cost incurred. After initial recognition, 
interest-bearing 
loans 
and 
borrowings 
are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
EIR method. Gains and losses are recognised in profit 
or loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as 
through the EIR amortization process. Amortised cost 
is calculated by taking into account any discount or 
premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an 
integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortization is included 
as finance costs in the statement of profit and loss.
 
Financial guarantee contracts
	
Financial guarantee contracts issued by the Company 
are those contracts that require a payment to be made 
to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because the 
specified debtor fails to make a payment when due 
in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. 
Financial guarantee contracts are recognised initially 
as a liability at fair value, adjusted for transaction costs 
that are directly attributable to the issuance of the 
guarantee. Subsequently, the liability is measured at 
the higher of the amount of loss allowance determined 
as per impairment requirements of Ind AS 109 and the 
amount recognised less cumulative amortisation.
 
Derecognition
	
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation 
under the liability is discharged or cancelled or 
expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced 
by another from the same lender on substantially 
different terms, or the terms of an existing liability 
are substantially modified, such an exchange or 
modification is treated as the derecognition of the 
original liability and the recognition of a new liability. 
The difference in the respective carrying amounts is 
recognised in the statement of profit and loss.
 
Offsetting of financial instruments
	
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and 
the net amount is reported in the balance sheet if 
there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset 
the recognized amounts and there is an intention to 
settle on a net basis, to realize the assets and settle the 
liabilities simultaneously.
h. 
Investment in subsidiaries
	
The investment in subsidiaries are carried at cost as per IND 
AS 27. Investment carried at cost is tested for impairment 
as per IND AS 36. An investor, regardless of the nature of its 
involvement with an entity (the investee), shall determine 
whether it is a parent by assessing whether it controls the 
investee.
	
On disposal of investment, the difference between it 
carrying amount and net disposal proceeds is charged or 
credited to the statement of profit and loss.
i. 
Revenue recognition
	
Revenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable that 
the economic benefits will flow to the Company and the 
revenue can be reliably measured. The following specific 
recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is 
recognized:
	
Revenue is recognised over time if either of the following 
conditions is met:
a. 	
Buyers take all the benefits of the property as real 
estate company construct the property.
196 | Annual Report 2023-24
Strategic Review
Corporate  Review
Financial Review
b.	
Buyers obtain physical possession of the property.
c.	
The property unit to be delivered is specified in 
the contract and real estate entity does not have an 
alternative use of the unit, the buyer does not have the 
discretion to terminate the contract and the entity has 
right to payment for work completed to date Revenue 
is recognized to the extent that it is probable that the 
economic benefits will flow to the Company and the 
revenue can be reliably measured. 
	
In case none of these conditions is met, revenue would 
be recognised at a point in time when the control of the 
property is passed on to the customer.
 
Revenue from shared services 
	
Revenue is recognised over period of time in respect of 
shares services on an accrual basis, in accordance with the 
terms of the respective contract as and when the Company 
satisfies performance obligations by delivering the services 
as per contractually agreed terms.
 
Revenue from project management consultancy/ 
secondment 
	
Revenue 
from 
project 
management 
consultancy/ 
secondment is recognized as per the terms of the 
agreement on the basis of services rendered
 
Gain on sale of investments 
	
On disposal of an investment, the difference between the 
carrying amount and net disposal proceeds is recognised 
to the profit and loss statement.
	
Interest and direct expenditure attributable to specific 
projects are capitalized in the cost of project,
	
other interest and indirect costs are treated as ‘Period Cost’ 
and charged to Profit & Loss account in the period in which 
it is incurred. 
	
All other incomes and expenditures are accounted for on 
accrual basis.
j. 
Taxes
 
Current income tax
	
Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at 
the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the 
taxation authorities in accordance with the Income Tax Act, 
1961 and the income computation and disclosure standards 
(ICDS) enacted in India by using tax rates and tax laws that 
are enacted or substantively enacted, at the reporting date.
	
Current income tax relating to items recognized outside 
profit or loss is recognized outside profit or loss (either in 
other comprehensive income or in equity). Current tax items 
are recognized in correlation to the underlying transaction 
either in OCI or directly in equity. Management periodically 
evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to 
situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to 
interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate.
 
Deferred tax
	
Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on 
temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting 
purposes at the reporting date. 
	
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences except:
-	
When the deferred tax liability arises from the initial 
recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a 
transaction that is not a business combination and, 
at the time of the transaction, affects neither the 
accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss;
-	
In respect of taxable temporary differences associated 
with investments in subsidiaries, when the timing of the 
reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled 
and it is probable that the temporary differences will 
not reverse in the foreseeable future
	
Deferred tax assets are recognized for all deductible 
temporary differences, the carry forward of unused tax 
credits and any unused tax losses. Deferred tax assets are 
recognized to the extent that it is probable that taxable 
profit will be available against which the deductible 
temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax 
credits and unused tax losses can be utilized except:
-	
When the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible 
temporary difference arises from the initial recognition 
of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not 
a business combination and, at the time of the 
transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor 
taxable profit or loss;
-	
In respect of deductible temporary differences 
associated with investments in subsidiaries, deferred 
tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is 
probable that the temporary differences will reverse 
in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be 
available against which the temporary differences can 
be utilised
Annual Report 2023-24 | 197 
Strategic Review
Corporate  Review
Financial Review
	
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed 
at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it 
is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be 
available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be 
utilized. Unrecognized deferred tax assets are re-assessed at 
each reporting date and are recognized to the extent that 
it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow 
the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax 
rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset 
is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and 
tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted 
at the reporting date.
	
Deferred tax relating to items recognized outside profit 
or loss is recognized outside the statement of profit or 
loss (either in other comprehensive income or in equity). 
Deferred tax items are recognized in correlation to the 
underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity.
	
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a 
legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets 
against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to 
the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
k. 
Borrowing costs
	
Borrowing cost includes interest expense as per effective 
interest rate [EIR]. Borrowing costs directly attributable to 
the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that 
necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready 
for its intended use or sale are capitalized as part of the cost 
of the asset until such time that the asset is substantially 
ready for their intended use. All other borrowing costs are 
expensed in the period in which they occur. Borrowing 
costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs 
in connection with the borrowing of funds. Borrowing cost 
also includes exchange differences to the extent regarded 
as an adjustment to the borrowing costs.
 l. 
Leases
	
The Company assesses at contract inception whether 
a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract 
conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset 
for a period of time in exchange for consideration.
 
Company as a lessee
	
The Company applies a single recognition and measurement 
approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and 
leases of low-value assets. The Company recognises lease 
liabilities to make lease payments and right-of-use assets 
representing the right to use the underlying assets.
i) 
Right-of-use assets
	
The Company recognises right-of-use assets at the 
commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the 
underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use 
assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for 
any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-
of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities 
recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease 
payments made at or before the commencement date 
less any lease incentives received. Right-of-use assets 
are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter 
of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the 
assets.
	
If ownership of the leased asset transfers to the 
Company at the end of the lease term or the cost 
reflects the exercise of a purchase option, depreciation 
is calculated using the estimated useful life of the asset.
	
The right-of-use assets are also subject to impairment. 
Refer to the accounting policies in section (d) 
Impairment of non-financial assets.
ii) 
Lease Liabilities
	
At the commencement date of the lease, the Company 
recognises lease liabilities measured at the present 
value of lease payments to be made over the lease 
term. The lease payments include fixed payments 
(including in substance fixed payments) less any lease 
incentives receivable, variable lease payments that 
depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected 
to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease 
payments also include the exercise price of a purchase 
option reasonably certain to be exercised by the 
Company and payments of penalties for terminating 
the lease, if the lease term reflects the Company 
exercising the option to terminate. Variable lease 
payments that do not depend on an index or a rate 
are recognised as expenses (unless they are incurred to 
produce inventories) in the period in which the event 
or condition that triggers the payment occurs.
198 | Annual Report 2023-24
Strategic Review
Corporate  Review
Financial Review
	
In calculating the present value of lease payments, 
the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate at 
the lease commencement date because the interest 
rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. 
After the commencement date, the amount of lease 
liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest 
and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, 
the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured 
if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, 
a change in the lease payments (e.g., changes to 
future payments resulting from a change in an index 
or rate used to determine such lease payments) or a 
change in the assessment of an option to purchase the 
underlying asset.
	
The Company’s lease liabilities are included in Interest-
bearing loans and borrowings.
iii)  Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets
	
The Company applies the short-term lease recognition 
exemption to its short-term leases of equipment (i.e., 
those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or 
less from the commencement date and do not contain 
a purchase option). It also applies the lease of low-
value assets recognition exemption to leases of office 
equipment that are considered to be low value. Lease 
payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value 
assets are recognised as expense on a straight-line 
basis over the lease term.
 
Company as a sub lessor
	
The Company is intermediate lessor as it subleases an 
asset leased from another lessor (the ‘head lessor’). The 
Company classifies the sublease as a finance lease or as 
an operating lease with reference to the right-of-use 
asset arising from the head lease. That is, the Company 
treats the right-of-use asset as the underlying asset in 
the sublease, not the underlying asset that it leases 
from the head lessor. At the commencement date of 
the sublease, if the Company cannot readily determine 
the interest rate implicit in the sublease, then it uses 
the discount rate that it uses for the head lease to 
account for the sublease, adjusted for any initial 
direct costs associated with the sublease. However, 
if the head lease is a short-term lease for which the 
company, as a lessee, has elected the short-term lease 
exemption, then the company classifies the sublease 
as an operating lease.
m. Provision and contingent liabilities
 
Provisions
	
A provision is recognized when the Company has a present 
obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of past event, 
it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying 
economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation 
and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the 
obligation. Provisions are not discounted to their present 
value (except where time value of money is material) and 
are determined based on the best estimate required to 
settle the obligation at the reporting date when discounting 
is used, the increase in provision due to passage of time is 
recognised as finance cost. These estimates are reviewed at 
each reporting date and adjusted to reflect the current best 
estimates.
 
Contingent liabilities
	
A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises 
from past events whose existence will be confirmed by the 
occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain 
future events beyond the control of the Company or a 
present obligation that is not recognized because it is not 
probable that an outflow of resources will be required to 
settle the obligation. A contingent liability also arises in 
extremely rare cases, where there is a liability that cannot 
be recognized because it cannot be measured reliably. the 
Company does not recognize a contingent liability but 
discloses its existence in the financial statements unless the 
probability of outflow of resources is remote.
	
Provisions, contingent liabilities, contingent assets and 
commitments are reviewed at each balance sheet date.
n. 
Retirement and other employee benefits
 
Provident fund
	
The Company contributed to employee’s provident fund 
benefits through a trust “Max Financial Services Limited 
Provident Fund Trust” managed by Max Financial Services 
Limited (erstwhile Max India Limited) whereby amounts 
determined at a fixed percentage of basic salaries of the 
employees are deposited to the trust every month. The 
benefit vests upon commencement of the employment. The 
interest rate payable by the trust to the beneficiaries every 
year is notified by the government and the Company has 
an obligation to make good the shortfall, if any, between 
the return from the investments of the trust and the notified 
interest rate. The Company has obtained actuarial valuation 
to determine the shortfall, if any, as at the Balance Sheet date.
Annual Report 2023-24 | 199 
Strategic Review
Corporate  Review
Financial Review
 
Gratuity
	
Gratuity liability is a defined benefit obligation and is 
provided for on the basis of an actuarial valuation on 
projected unit credit method made at the end of each 
financial year
	
Remeasurements, comprising of actuarial gains and losses, 
the effect of the asset ceiling, excluding amounts included 
in net interest on the net defined benefit liability and the 
return on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net 
interest on the net defined benefit liability), are recognized 
immediately in the Balance Sheet with a corresponding 
debit or credit to retained earnings through OCI in the 
period in which they occur. Remeasurements are not 
reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods.
	
Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to 
the net defined benefit (liabilities/assets). 
	
The Company recognized the following changes in the 
net defined benefit obligation under employee benefit 
expenses in statement of profit and loss
a)	
Service cost comprising current service cost, past 
service cost, gain & loss on curtailments and non-
routine settlements.
b)	
Net interest expenses or income
 
Compensated absences
	
Accumulated leave, which is expected to be utilized within 
the next 12 months, is treated as short-term employee 
benefit. The Company measures the expected cost of such 
absences as the additional amount that it expects to pay as 
a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at 
the reporting date.
	
The Company treats accumulated leave expected to be 
carried forward beyond twelve months, as long-term 
employee benefit for measurement purposes. Such long-
term compensated absences are provided for based on the 
actuarial valuation using the projected unit credit method 
at the yearend. Actuarial gains/losses are immediately 
taken to the statement of profit and loss and are not 
deferred. The Company presents the leave as a current 
liability in the balance sheet, to the extent it does not 
have an unconditional right to defer its settlement for 12 
months after the reporting date. Where Company has 
the unconditional legal and contractual right to defer the 
settlement for a period 12 months, the same is presented as 
non-current liability.
 
Short-term obligations
	
Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary 
benefits that are expected to be settled wholly within twelve 
months after the end of the period in which the employees 
render the related service are recognized in respect of 
employee service up to the end of the reporting period and 
are measured at the amount expected to be paid when the 
liabilities are settled. the liabilities are presented as current 
employee benefit obligations in the balance sheet.
 
Long term incentive plan
	
The Company has a long-term incentive plan for certain 
employees. The Company recognises benefit payable to 
employee as an expenditure, when an employee renders 
the related service on actual basis.
o. 
Share-based payments
	
Employees of the Company receive remuneration in 
the form of share-based payment transaction, whereby 
employees render services as a consideration for equity 
instruments (equity- settled transactions).
 
Equity-settled transactions
	
The cost of equity-settled transactions is determined by 
the fair value at the date when the grant is made using an 
appropriate valuation model.
	
That cost is recognized, together with a corresponding 
increase in share-based payment (SBP) reserves in equity, 
over the period in which the performance and/or service 
conditions are fulfilled in employee benefits expense. 
The cumulative expense recognized for equity-settled 
transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date 
reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired 
and the Company’s best estimate of the number of equity 
instruments that will ultimately vest. The statement of 
profit and loss expense or credit for a period represents 
the movement in cumulative expense recognized as at 
the beginning and end of that period and is recognized in 
employee benefits expense.
	
Service and non-market performance conditions are not 
taken into account when determining the grant date fair 
value of awards, but the likelihood of the conditions being 
met is assessed as part of the Company’s best estimate 
of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately 
vest. Market performance conditions are reflected within 
the grant date fair value. Any other conditions attached to 
an award, but without an associated service requirement, 
are considered to be non-vesting conditions. Non-vesting 
200 | Annual Report 2023-24
Strategic Review
Corporate  Review
Financial Review
conditions are reflected in the fair value of an award and 
lead to an immediate expensing of an award unless there 
are also service and/or performance conditions.
	
No expense is recognized for awards that do not ultimately 
vest because non-market performance and/or service 
conditions have not been met. Where awards include 
a market or non-vesting condition, the transactions are 
treated as vested irrespective of whether the market or 
non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other 
performance and/or service conditions are satisfied.
	
When the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, 
the minimum expense recognized is the expense had the 
terms had not been modified, if the original terms of the 
award are met. An additional expense is recognized for any 
modification that increases the total fair value of the share-
based payment transaction or is otherwise beneficial to the 
employee as measured at the date of modification. Where 
an award is cancelled by the entity or by the counterparty, 
any remaining element of the fair value of the award is 
expensed immediately through profit or loss.
	
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as 
additional share dilution in the computation of diluted 
earnings per share.
 
Cash-settled transactions
	
The cost of cash-settled transactions is measured initially 
at fair value at the grant date using a binomial model. This 
fair value is expensed over the period until the vesting date 
with recognition of a corresponding liability. The liability is 
remeasured to fair value at each reporting date up to, and 
including the settlement date, with changes in fair value 
recognized in employee benefits expense.
p. 
Cash and cash equivalents
	
Cash and cash equivalent in the balance sheet comprise 
cash at banks and on hand and short-term deposits with an 
original maturity of three months or less, which are subject 
to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
q. 
Earnings per share
	
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the 
net profit or loss for the period attributable to equity 
shareholders by the weighted average number of equity 
shares outstanding during the period. The weighted 
average number of equity shares outstanding during the 
period is adjusted for events such as bonus issue, bonus 
element in a rights issue, share split, and reverse share split 
(consolidation of shares) that have changed the number 
of equities shares outstanding, without a corresponding 
change in resources.
	
For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, 
the net profit or loss for the year and the weighted average 
number of shares outstanding during the year adjusted for 
the effects of all potential equity shares.
r. 
Foreign currencies
	
Items included in the standalone Ind AS financial 
statements are measured using the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the company operates 
(‘the functional currency’). The Company’s standalone Ind 
AS financial statements are presented in Indian rupee (‘Rs.’) 
which is also the Company’s functional and presentation 
currency.
	
Foreign currency transactions are recorded on initial 
recognition in the functional currency, using the exchange 
rate prevailing at the date of transaction. However, for 
practical reasons, the Company uses an average rate if the 
average approximates the actual rate at the date of the 
transaction.
	
Measurement of foreign currency items at the balance sheet 
date
	
Foreign 
currency 
monetary 
assets 
and 
liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the 
functional currency spot rates of exchange at the reporting 
date.
	
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of 
historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the 
exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-
monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency 
are translated using the exchange rates at the date when 
the fair value is determined.
	
Exchange differences arising on settlement or translation of 
monetary items are recognized as income or expense in the 
period in which they arise with the exception of exchange 
differences on gain or loss arising on translation of non-
monetary items measured at fair value which is treated in 
line with the recognition of the gain or loss on the change 
in fair value of the item (i.e., translation differences on items 
whose fair value gain or loss is recognized in OCI or profit or 
loss are also recognized in OCI or profit or loss, respectively).

Fair value
	
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an 
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction

Financial Review
between market participants at the measurement date. The 
fair value measurement is based on the presumption that 
the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes 
place either:
a)	
In the principal market for the asset or liability, or
b)	
In the absence of a principal market, in the most 
advantageous market for the asset or liability
	
The principal or the most advantageous market must be 
accessible by the Company.
	
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using 
the assumptions that market participants would use 
when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market 
participants act in their economic best interest.
	
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into 
account a market participant’s ability to generate economic 
benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by 
selling it to another market participant that would use the 
asset in its highest and best use.
	
The Company uses valuation techniques that are 
appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient 
date are available to measure fair value, maximising the use 
of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of 
unobservable inputs.
	
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured 
or disclosed in the restated financial statements are 
categorized within the fair value hierarchy, described as 
follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to 
the fair value measurement as a whole:
a)	
Level 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active 
markets for identical assets or liabilities
b)	
Level 2 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level 
input that is significant to the fair value measurement is 
directly or indirectly observable
c)	
Level 3 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level 
input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
is unobservable
	
For assets and liabilities that are recognized in the restated 
financial statements on a recurring basis, the Company 
determines whether transfers have occurred between 
levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorization (based 
on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting 
period.
	
The Company’s management determines the policies and 
procedures for both recurring and non-recurring fair value 
measurement measured at fair value.
	
At each reporting date, the management analyses the 
movements in the values of assets and liabilities which 
are required to be remeasured or re-assessed as per the 
Company’s accounting policies.
	
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Company has 
determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of 
the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability 
and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above.
	
This note summarises accounting policy for fair value. Other 
fair value related disclosures are given in the relevant notes.

2C Accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
	
The preparation of the Company’s standalone Ind AS financial 
statements requires management to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of 
revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying 
disclosures, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. 
Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result 
in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying 
amount of the asset or liability affected in future periods. 
Other disclosures relating to the Company’s exposure to risks 
and uncertainties includes:

Judgements
	
In the process of applying the Company’s accounting policies, 
management has made the following judgements, which have 
the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the 
standalone Ind AS financial statements.
(a) Determining the lease term of contracts with renewal 
and termination options - Company as lessee
	
The Company determines the lease term as the non-
cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods 
covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably 
certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option 
202 | Annual Report 2023-24
Strategic Review
Corporate  Review
Financial Review
to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be 
exercised.
	
The Company applies judgement in evaluating whether it is 
reasonably certain whether or not to exercise the option to 
renew or terminate the lease. That is, it considers all relevant 
factors that create an economic incentive for it to exercise 
either the renewal or termination. After the commencement 
date, the Company reassesses the lease term if there is a 
significant event or change in circumstances that is within 
its control and affects its ability to exercise or not to exercise 
the option to renew or to terminate (e.g., construction 
of significant leasehold improvements or significant 
customisation to the leased asset)
 
Estimates and assumptions
	
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key 
sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, 
that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment 
to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the 
next financial year, are described below. The Company 
based its assumptions and estimates on parameters 
available when the financial statements were prepared. 
Existing circumstances and assumptions about future 
developments, however, may change due to market 
changes or circumstances arising beyond the control of the 
Company. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions 
when they occur.
(a) Defined benefit plans
	
The cost of defined benefit plans (i.e. Gratuity benefit) is 
determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation 
involves making various assumptions which may differ 
from actual developments in the future. These include the 
determination of the discount rate, future salary increases, 
mortality rates and future pension increases. Due to the 
complexity of the valuation, the underlying assumptions 
and its long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation 
is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All 
assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date. In 
determining the appropriate discount rate, management 
considers the interest rates of long-term government 
bonds with extrapolated maturity corresponding to the 
expected duration of the defined benefit obligation. The 
mortality rate is based on publicly available mortality 
tables for the specific countries. Future salary increases and 
pension increases are based on expected future inflation 
rates. Further details about the assumptions used, including 
a sensitivity analysis, are given in Note 32.
(b) Fair value measurement of financial instruments
	
When the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities 
recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured 
based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value 
is measured using valuation techniques including the 
Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. The inputs to these 
models are taken from observable markets where possible, 
but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is 
required in establishing fair values. Judgements include 
considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and 
volatility. Changes in assumptions about these factors could 
affect the reported fair value of financial instruments. The 
Company use Net asset value for valuation of investment 
in mutual fund. Refer note 36B related to fair valuation 
disclosures.
(c) Impairment of Financial assets
	
The impairment provisions of financial assets are based 
on assumptions about risk of default and expected loss 
rates. the Company uses judgement in making these 
assumptions and selecting the inputs to the impairment 
calculation, based on Company’s past history, existing 
market conditions as well as forward looking estimates at 
the end of each reporting period.
(d) Impairment of non-financial assets
	
The Company assesses at each reporting date whether 
there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any 
indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for 
an asset is required, the Company estimates the asset’s 
recoverable amount. An assets recoverable amount is the 
higher of an asset’s CGU’S fair value less cost of disposal 
and its value in use. It is determined for an individual 
asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows 
that are largely independent of those from other assets 
or Company’s assets. Where the carrying amount of an 
asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is 
considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable 
amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash 
flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of 
the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In 
determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market 
transactions are taken into account. If no such transactions 
can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used. 
These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, 
or other fair value indicators.

Strategic Review
Corporate  Review
Financial Review
(e) Share based payments
	
The Company initially measures the cost of cash settled 
transactions with employees using a binomial model to 
determine the fair value of the liability incurred. Estimating 
fair value for share based payment transactions requires 
determination of the most appropriate valuation model, 
which is dependent on the terms and conditions of the 
grant. This estimate also requires determination of the most 
appropriate inputs to the valuation model including the 
expected life of the share option, volatility and dividend 
yield and making assumptions about them. For cash settled 
share-based payment transactions, the liability needs to 
be remeasured at the end of each reporting period up 
to the date of settlement, with any changes in fair value 
recognized in the profit or loss. This requires a reassessment 
of the estimates used at the end of each reporting period. 
The assumptions and models used for estimating fair value 
for share based payment transactions are disclosed in note 
35.
2D Recent accounting pronouncements:
A.	 Amended standards adopted by the Company
(i) Definition of A ccounting Estimates - A mendments to 
Ind A S 8
	
The amendments clarify the distinction between changes 
in accounting estimates and changes in accounting policies 
and the correction of errors. It has also been clarified how 
entities use measurement techniques and inputs to develop 
accounting estimates.
	
The amendments does not have any material impact on 
the standalone financial statements as there is no change in 
accounting estimates and changes in accounting policies 
and the correction of errors.
(ii) Disclosure of A
ccounting Policies - A
mendments to 
Ind A S 1
	
The amendments aim to help entities provide accounting 
policy disclosures that are more useful by replacing the 
requirement for entities to disclose their ‘significant’ 
accounting policies with a requirement to disclose their 
‘material’ accounting policies and adding guidance on how 
entities apply the concept of materiality in making decisions 
about accounting policy disclosures.
	
The company has given accounting policies disclosures to 
ensure consistency with the amended requirements.
(iii) Deferred T ax related to A ssets and Liabilities arising 
from a Single T ransaction - A mendments to I nd A S 12
	
The amendments narrow the scope of the initial recognition 
exception under Ind AS 12, so that it no longer applies to 
transactions that give rise to equal taxable and deductible 
temporary differences.
	
The amendments should be applied to transactions that 
occur on or after the beginning of the earliest comparative 
period presented. In addition, at the beginning of the 
earliest comparative period presented, a deferred tax 
asset (provided that sufficient taxable profit is available) 
and a deferred tax liability should also be recognised 
for all deductible and taxable temporary differences 
associated with leases and decommissioning obligations. 
Consequential amendments have been made in Ind AS 101. 
	
The amendments does not have any material impact on the 
financial statements.

Strategic Review
Corporate  Review
Notes forming part of the Standalone Ind-AS financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2024
Financial Review
	
The gratuity plan is governed by the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. Under the act, employee who has completed five years of service 
is entitled to specific benefit. The level of benefits provided depends on the member’s length of service and salary at retirement age. 
 
Description of R isk exposures
	
Valuations are based on certain assumptions, which are dynamic in nature and vary over time. As such company is exposed to various 
risks as follow:
i) 	
Salary I ncreases- Actual salary increases will increase the Plan’s liability. Increase in salary increase rate assumption in future 
valuations will also increase the liability.
ii) 	 Discount R ate : Reduction in discount rate in subsequent valuations can increase the plan’s liability.
iii) 	 Mortality & disability – Actual deaths & disability cases proving lower or higher than assumed in the valuation can impact the 
liabilities.
iv) 	 Investment R isk – If Plan is funded then assets liabilities mismatch & actual investment return on assets lower than the discount 
rate assumed at the last valuation date can impact the liability.

The estimates of rate of escalation in salary considered in actuarial valuation are after taking into account inflation, seniority, 
promotion and other relevant factors including supply and demand in the employment market. The above information is as 
certified by the Actuary. 
 k)	 Discount rate is based on the prevailing market yields of Indian Government securities as at the balance sheet date for the 
estimated term of the obligations.
 l)	
The sensitivity analysis above have been determined based on a method that extrapolates the impact on defined benefit 
obligation as a result of reasonable changes in key assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting year.
m)	 Risk Exposure:  Valuations are performed on certain basic set of pre-determined assumptions and other regulatory framework 
which may vary over time. Thus, the Company is exposed to various risks in providing the above gratuity benefit which are as 
follows: 
 
Interest R ate risk: The plan exposes the Company to the risk of fall in interest rates. A fall in interest rates will result in an increase 
in the ultimate cost of providing the above benefit and will thus result in an increase in the value of the liability (as shown in 
financial statements). 
 
Liquidity R isk: This is the risk that the Company is not able to meet the short-term gratuity payouts. This may arise due to non 
availability of enough cash / cash equivalent to meet the liabilities or holding of illiquid assets not being sold in time. 
 
Salary Escalation R isk: The present value of the defined benefit plan is calculated with the assumption of salary increase rate 
of plan participants in future. Deviation in the rate of increase of salary in future for plan participants from the rate of increase in 
salary used to determine the present value of obligation will have a bearing on the plan’s liability.

Demographic R isk: The Company has used certain mortality and attrition assumptions in valuation of the liability. The Company 
is exposed to the risk of actual experience turning out to be worse compared to the assumption.
33	 The Code on Social Security, 2020 (‘Code’) relating to employee benefits received Presidential assent in September 2020. However, effective

Investment in equity shares of subsidiaries are measured at cost as per Ind AS 27- “Separate Financial Statements” and are not required 
to be disclosed here.
	
The management assessed that carrying value of trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents, other bank balances, loans and advances 
to related parties, interest receivable, trade payables, capital creditors are considered to be the same as their fair values, due to their 
short term nature.
	
The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities is included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current 
transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. The following methods and assumptions were used to 
estimate the fair values:
	
Long Term Fixed-rate borrowings are evaluated by the Company based on parameters such as interest rates, specific country risk 
factors, individual creditworthiness of the customer and the risk characteristics of the financed project. Based on this evaluation, 
allowances are taken into account for the expected credit losses of these receivables.
	
The fair value of non - current investment, loans taken, other financial assets and other financial liabilities are estimated by discounting 
future cash flows using rates currently available for debt on similar terms, credit risk and remaining maturities. The valuation requires

management to use observable inputs in the model, of which the significant observable inputs is the market rate of interest of 9.5%-
11%. Management regularly assesses a range of reasonably possible alternatives for those significant observable inputs and determines 
their impact on the total fair value.
B. 
Fair value hierarchy
	
The Company uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique:
	
Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
	
Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or 
indirectly.
	
Level 3: techniques that use inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market 
data.

Credit Risk is the risk that the counter party will not meet its obligation under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to 
a financial loss. The Company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade receivables) and from its financing 
activities, including deposits with banks, foreign exchange transactions and other financial instruments.

Customer credit risk is managed subject to the Company’s established policy, procedures and control relating to customer credit 
risk management. Management evaluate credit risk relating to customers on an ongoing basis. Receivable control management 
team assesses the credit quality of the customer, taking into account its financial position, past experience and other factors. 
Outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored and any shipments to major customers are generally covered by letters 
of credit or other forms of credit insurance. An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date on Company category 
basis. The calculation is based on exchange losses historical data and available facts as on date of evaluation. Trade receivables 
comprise a widespread customer base. The Company evaluates the concentration of risk with respect to trade receivables as low, 
as its customers are located in several jurisdictions and industries and operate in largely independent markets.
(ii)  Financial instruments and cash deposit
	
Credit risk from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed by the Company’s treasury department in accordance 
with the Company’s policy. Investments of surplus funds are made in bank deposits and other risk free securities. The limits are 
set to minimize the concentration of risks and therefore mitigate financial loss through counter party’s potential failure to make 
payments. Credit limits of all authorities are reviewed by the management on regular basis. All balances with banks and financial 
institutions is subject to low credit risk due to good credit ratings assigned to the Company.

d)  Market risk
	
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market 
prices. Market risks comprises three types of risk: currency rate risk, interest rate risk and other price risks, such as equity price risk and 
commodity price risk. Financial instruments affected by market risks include loans and borrowings, deposits, investments and foreign 
currency receivables and payables. The sensitivity analyses in the following sections relate to the position as at March 31, 2023 and 
March 31, 2024. The analyses exclude the impact of movements in market variables on; the carrying values of gratuity and other post-
retirement obligations; provisions; and the non-financial assets and liabilities. The sensitivity of the relevant Profit and Loss item is the 
effect of the assumed changes in the respective market risks. This is based on the financial assets and financial liabilities held as of 
March 31, 2023, and March 31, 2024.
(i)  Interest rate risk
	
Interest rate is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market 
interest rates. The Company’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Company’s long term 
debt obligation at fixed interest rate.

Company’s operating activities (when revenue, expense or capital expenditure is denominated in foreign currency). Foreign 
currency exchange rate exposure is partly balanced by purchasing of goods in foreign currency. The Company evaluates exchange

The Composite Scheme of Amalgamation and Arrangement (‘Scheme’) amongst Max Ventures and Industries Limited (‘Transferor 
Company’) and Max Estates Limited (‘Company’ or ‘Transferee Company’) and their respective shareholders and Creditors was filed during 
the previous year under the provisions of Section 230 to 232 read with Section 66 and other applicable provisions of the Companies Act, 
2013 and Rules made thereunder. The Hon’ble National Company Law Tribunal, Chandigarh Bench (“Hon’ble NCLT”) vide its order dated July 
03, 2023 approved the aforesaid Scheme. As per the Scheme, the merger of Transferor Company into Company has been accounted with 
effect from April 01, 2022 (‘Appointed Date’) to comply with the accounting treatment prescribed in the Scheme, which is in compliance 
with the MCA general circular no. 09/2019 dated August 21, 2019.
	
Being a common control business combination, Ind AS 103 Business Combinations requires the Company to account for business 
combination from the combination date (i.e., the date on which control has been transferred) or the earliest date presented in the financial 
statements, whichever is later.
	
Subsequent to the period end, SEBI granted the relaxation to the Company on from the applicability of Rule 19 (2)(b) of Securities Contract 
(Regulation) Rule 1957 for the listing of the shares on stock exchanges.
	
The impact of the scheme in these Ind AS financial statements is given below:
(a) 	 All assets, liabilities and reserves of the transferor company have been recorded in the books of account of the Company at their 
existing carrying amounts and in the same form.
(b) 	 To the extent that there are inter-company loans, advances, deposits, balances or other obligations as between the transferor Company 
and the Company, have been eliminated.
(c) 	 Upon the coming into effect of this Scheme and in consideration of the transfer, 1 (one) equity shares of the face value of INR 10 each 
fully paid-up of the Company has been issued against every 1 (one) equity shares of INR 10 each fully paid-up held by the shareholders 
of the transferor company. Consequent to this, the Company has issued 146,976,918 equity shares of INR 10 each fully paid-up for 
146,976,918 equity shares of INR 10 each fully paid-up of Max Ventures and Industries Limited.
	
These shares have been disclosed as ‘Share capital pending issuance’ as at March 31, 2023. These shares have been issued during the 
year ended March 31, 2024.
(d) 	 The balance of assets and liabilities transferred from the transferor company as on April 01, 2022 are as follows:

section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards 
are further described in the ‘Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of 
the Consolidated Financial Statements’ section of our report. We are 
independent of the Group, in accordance with the ‘Code of Ethics’

with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules 
thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities 
in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the 
consolidated financial statements.

Judgement    and    estimate 
are    required   by management 
in  assessing  assets  meeting 
the capitalisation criteria set

Judgement   is   involved   in 
determining   the eligibility of 
costs including borrowing cost 
and other directly attributable 
costs for capitalisation as per 
the criteria set out in Ind AS 
23, Borrowing Costs.
In view of the significance 
of

related to  capital  expenditure 
and capitalisation of assets.
• We 
performed 
substantive 
testing on a sample basis for 
each element of capitalised 
costs including inventory for 
the purpose of these projects, 
physical verification performed 
by management  along  with 
reconciliation  and directly 
attributable

to the  calculation  and  tested 
the  arithmetical accuracy of 
the model.
• We  assessed  the  adequacy 
of the   related disclosures    in 
the    consolidated   financial 
statements.
Other I nformation
The Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the other 
information. The other information comprises the Board’s Report, 
but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our 
auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover 
the other information and we do not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, 
our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether such other information is materially inconsistent 
with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge 
obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is 
a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to 
report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of Management for the Consolidated 
Financial Statements
The Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the 
preparation and presentation of these consolidated financial 
statements in terms of the requirements of the Act that give a true 
and fair view of the consolidated financial position, consolidated 
financial performance including other comprehensive income, 
consolidated cash flows and consolidated statement of changes in 
equity of the Group in accordance with the accounting principles 
generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting 
Standards (Ind AS) specified under section 133 of the Act read with the 
Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. 
The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the 
Group are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting 
records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding 
of the assets of their respective companies and for preventing and 
detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of 
appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates 
that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation 
and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were 
operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of 
the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation 
of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view 
and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or 
error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the 
consolidated financial statements by the Directors of the Holding 
Company, as aforesaid.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the respective 
Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group are 
responsible for assessing the ability of their respective companies to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related 
to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting 
unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease 
operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
Those respective Board of Directors of the companies included in 
the Group are also responsible for overseeing the financial reporting 
process of their respective companies.
Auditor’s R esponsibilities for the A
udit of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material 
250 | Annual Report 2023-24
Strategic Review
Corporate  Review
Financial Review
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s 
report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high 
level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted 
in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users 
taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional 
judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the 
audit. We also:
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the 
consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, 
design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, 
and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting 
from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit 
in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also 
responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Holding 
Company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such 
controls.
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the 
reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures 
made by management.
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going 
concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence 
obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events 
or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the ability of 
the Group to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a 
material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our 
auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial 
statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our 
opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained 
up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or 
conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going 
concern.
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the 
consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and 
whether the consolidated financial statements represent the 
underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair 
presentation.
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the 
financial information of the entities or business activities within 
the Group of which we are the independent auditors and whose 
financial information we have audited, to express an opinion on 
the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the 
direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the financial 
statements of such entities included in the consolidated financial 
statements of which we are the independent auditors. For the other 
entities included in the consolidated financial statements, which 
have been audited by other auditors, such other auditors remain 
responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the 
audits carried out by them. We remain solely responsible for our audit 
opinion.
We communicate with those charged with governance of the Holding 
Company and such other entities included in the consolidated 
financial statements of which we are the independent auditors 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of 
the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant 
deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement 
that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding 
independence, and to communicate with them all relationships 
and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, 
we determine those matters that were of most significance in the 
audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year 
ended March 31,2024 and are therefore the key audit matters. We 
describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation 
precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely 
rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be 
communicated in our report because the adverse consequences 
of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public 
interest benefits of such communication.

information, in respect of six subsidiaries, whose financial

Report on the I nternal Financial Controls under Clause (i) of 
Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies A ct, 2013 (“the 
Act”)
In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial statements 
of Max Estates Limited (hereinafter referred to as the “Holding 
Company”) as of and for the year ended March 31, 2024, we have 
audited the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated 
financial statements of the Holding Company and its subsidiaries (the 
Holding Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as “the 
Group”), which are companies incorporated in India, as of that date.
Management’s R esponsibility for I nternal Financial Controls
The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the 
Group, which are companies incorporated in India, are responsible 
for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based 
on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established 
by the Holding Company considering the essential components 
of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal 
Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of 
Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI). These responsibilities include 
the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal 
financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the 
orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence 
to the respective company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, 
the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and 
completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation 
of reliable financial information, as required under the Companies 
Act, 2013.
Auditor’s R esponsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Holding Company’s 
internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial 
statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance 
with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over 
Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) and the Standards on 
Auditing, specified under section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent 
applicable to an audit of internal financial controls, both, issued by 
ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply 
with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial 
controls with reference to consolidated financial statements was 
established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively 
in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence 
about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference to 
consolidated financial statements and their operating effectiveness. 
Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated 
financial statements included obtaining an understanding of internal 
financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements, 
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and 
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control 
based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the 
auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material 
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or 
error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit 
evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms of their reports 
referred to in the Other Matters paragraph below, is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal 
financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements.
Meaning of I nternal Financial Controls with reference to 
Consolidated Financial Statements
A company’s internal financial control with reference to consolidated 
financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable 
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and 
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A 
company’s internal financial control with reference to consolidated 
financial statements includes those policies and procedures that 
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, 
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of 
the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that 
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation 
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the 
company are being made only in accordance with authorisations 
of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide 
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of 
unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets 
that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of I nternal Financial Controls with 
Reference to Consolidated Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls 
with reference to consolidated financial statements, including the 
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, 
material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be 
detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial 
controls with reference to consolidated financial statements to future 
periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial controls 
with reference to consolidated financial statements may become

inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of 
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion, the Group, its subsidiaries, which are companies 
incorporated in India, have, maintained in all material respects, 
adequate internal financial controls with reference to consolidated 
financial statements and such internal financial controls with 
reference to consolidated financial statements were operating 
effectively as at March 31,2024, based on the internal control over 
financial reporting criteria established by the Holding Company 
considering the essential components of internal control stated in 
the Guidance Note issued by the ICAI.
Other matters
Our report under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on the adequacy 
and operating effectiveness of the internal financial controls with 
reference to consolidated financial statements of the Holding 
Company, in so far as it relates to the subsidiary companies, which 
are companies incorporated in India, is based on the corresponding 
reports of the auditors of such subsidiary.

Corporate I nformation

statements of Max Estates Limited (the Company) and its 
subsidiaries (collectively, the Group) for the year ended March

Registered office of the Company is located at 419, Bhai Mohan 
Singh Nagar, Village Railmajra, Tehsil Balachaur, Nawanshehar,

The Group is principally engaged in the business of: 

Construction and development of residential and


Making investments in various companies and primarily 
engaged in growing and nurturing these business 
investments;

Providing facility management services and managed 
office services

Providing

to 
its 
other 
group 
companies	
During the current year, the Company has completed the merger 
of Max Ventures and Industries Limited (‘Transferor Company’) 
(appointed date April 01, 2022) pursuant to the scheme of merger 
filed under the provisions of Section 230 to 232 read with Section 
66 and other applicable provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 
and Rules made thereunder. The Hon’ble National Company Law 
Tribunal, Chandigarh Bench (“Hon’ble NCLT”) vide its order dated 
July 03, 2023, approved the aforesaid Scheme. 
Pursuant to merger of Max Ventures and Industries Limited 
(‘Transferor Company’) and Max Estates Limited (‘Company’ 
or ‘Transferee Company’), as per the Scheme, the merger of 
Transferor Company into Company has been accounted with 
effect from April 01, 2022 (‘Appointed Date’) to comply with 
the accounting treatment prescribed in the Scheme. The share 
capital of Transferor Company and Transferee Company was 
cancelled and the Company has issued 147,134,544 equity 
shares of ` 10 each fully paid-up to the shareholders of the 
Transferor Company in the previous quarter. On October 30, 
2023, the equity shares of the Company were listed on National 
Stock Exchange (NSE) and Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE).
The consolidated Ind AS financial statements were authorised for 
issue in accordance with a resolution by the Board of directors of 
the Company on May 22, 2024.

Accounting policies
2.1 a) 
Basis of preparation
These consolidated financial statements of the Group have 
been prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting 
Standards (IND AS) notified under the Companies (Indian 
Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 (as amended from time 
to time) and presentation requirements of division II of 
Schedule III to the Companies Act 2013 (Ind AS Compliant 
Schedule III).
The consolidated Ind AS financial statements have been 
prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the following 
assets and liabilities which have been measured at fair value
(i)	
Certain financial assets and liabilities (refer accounting 
policy regarding financial instruments)
(ii)	 Defined benefit plans - plan assets 
The Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements are presented 
in INR and all values are rounded to nearest Lakhs (INR 
00,000) except when otherwise stated
The accounting policies have been consistently applied by 
the Group.
 b) Basis of Consolidation
The Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements (CFS) 
comprises the financial statements of the Company and its 
subsidiaries. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, 
or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with 
the investee and has the ability to affect those returns 
through its power over the investee. Specifically, the Group 
controls an investee if and only if the Group has:

Power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give it 
the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the 
investee)

Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its 
involvement with the investee, and

The ability to use its power over the investee to affect 
its returns
Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting 
rights result in control. To support this presumption and 
when the Group has less than a majority of the voting or 
similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all relevant 
facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power 
over an investee, including:

The contractual arrangement with the other vote 
Notes forming part of the consolidated financial 
statements for the year e nded March 31, 2024
262 | Annual Report 2023-24
Strategic Review
Corporate  Review
Financial Review
holders of the investee

Rights arising from other contractual arrangements 

The Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights

The size of the group’s holding of voting rights relative 
to the size and dispersion of the holdings of the other 
voting rights holders
The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee 
if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to 
one or more of the three elements of control. Consolidation 
of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over 
the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control 
of the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses 
of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are 
included in the consolidated Ind AS financial statements 
from the date the Group gains control until the date the 
Group ceases to control the subsidiary. 
Consolidated Ind AS financial statements are prepared 
using uniform accounting policies for like transactions 
and other events in similar circumstances. If a member 
of the group uses accounting policies other than those 
adopted in the consolidated Ind AS financial statements 
for like transactions and events in similar circumstances, 
appropriate adjustments are made to that group member’s 
financial statements in preparing the consolidated Ind AS 
financial statements to ensure conformity with the group’s 
accounting policies.
The financial statements of all entities used for the purpose 
of consolidation are drawn up to same reporting date as 
that of the parent company, i.e., period ended June 30. 
When the end of the reporting period of the parent is 
different from that of a subsidiary, the subsidiary prepares, 
for consolidation purposes, additional financial information 
as of the same date as the financial statements of the parent 
to enable the parent to consolidate the financial information 
of the subsidiary, unless it is impracticable to do so.
Consolidation procedure:
(i) 	 Combine like items of assets, liabilities, equity, income, 
expenses and cash flows of the parent with those of its 
subsidiaries. For this purpose, income and expenses of 
the subsidiary are based on the amounts of the assets 
and liabilities recognised in the consolidated Ind AS 
financial statements at the acquisition date.
(ii) 	 Offset (eliminate) the carrying amount of the parent’s 
investment in each subsidiary and the parent’s portion 
of equity of each subsidiary. 
(iii)	 Eliminate in full intragroup assets and liabilities, 
equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to 
transactions between entities of the Group (profits 
or losses resulting from intragroup transactions that 
are recognised in assets, such as inventory and fixed 
assets, are eliminated in full). Intragroup losses may 
indicate an impairment that requires recognition in 
the consolidated Ind AS financial statements. IND AS12 
Income Taxes applies to temporary differences that 
arise from the elimination of profits and losses resulting 
from intragroup transactions.
Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive 
income (OCI) are attributed to the equity holders of the 
parent of the Group and to the non-controlling interests, 
even if this results in the non-controlling interests having 
a deficit balance. When necessary, adjustments are made 
to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their 
accounting policies into line with the Group’s accounting 
policies. All intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, 
income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions 
between members of the Group are eliminated in full on 
consolidation.
A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without 
a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction. If 
the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it:

Derecognises the assets (including goodwill) and 
liabilities of the subsidiary at their carrying amounts at 
the date when control is lost

Derecognises the carrying amount of any non-
controlling interests

Derecognises the cumulative translation differences 
recorded in equity

Recognises the fair value of the consideration received

Recognises the fair value of any investment retained

Recognises any surplus or deficit in profit or loss
Reclassifies the parent’s share of components previously 
recognised in OCI to profit or loss or retained earnings, as 
appropriate, as would be required if the Group had directly 
disposed of the related assets or liabilities.
The Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the 
acquired entity on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis 
either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s 
proportionate share of the acquired entity’s net identiﬁable 
assets. Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of 
non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at 
initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests’ share 
of subsequent changes in equity. Total comprehensive 
income is attributed to non-controlling interests even if 
it results in the non-controlling interest having a deﬁcit 
balance.

2.2 Summary of accounting policies 
a. 
Current versus non-current classification
	
The Group presents assets and liabilities in the balance 
sheet based on current/ non-current classification. An asset 
is treated as current when it is:
(i)	
Expected to be realized or intended to be sold or 
consumed in normal operating cycle
(ii) Held primarily for the purpose of trading
(iii)	 Expected to be realized within twelve months after the 
reporting period, or 
(iv)	 Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being 
exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve 
months after the reporting period
All other assets are classified as non-current. 
A liability is current when:
(i)	
It is expected to be settled in normal operating cycle
(ii)	 It is held primarily for the purpose of trading
(iii)	 It is due to settled within twelve months after the 
reporting period, or
(iv)	 There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement 
of the liability for at least twelve months after the 
reporting period.
The Group classifies all other liabilities as non-current.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-
current assets and liabilities.
The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition of 
assets for processing and their realization in cash and cash 
equivalents. The Group has identified twelve months as its 
operating cycle.	
	
b. 
Property, Plant and Equipment and I
nvestment 
Property
(i) Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, Plant and equipment including capital 
work in progress are stated at cost, less accumulated 
depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, 
if any. The cost comprises of purchase price, taxes, 
duties, freight and other incidental expenses directly 
attributable and related to acquisition and installation 
of the concerned assets and are further adjusted by the 
amount of GST credit availed wherever applicable. Cost 
includes borrowing cost for long term construction 
projects if recognition criteria are met. When 
significant parts of plant and equipment are required 
to be replaced at intervals, the Group depreciates 
them separately based on their respective useful 
lives. Likewise, when a major inspection is performed, 
its cost is recognized in the carrying amount of the 
plant, property and equipment as a replacement if the 
recognition criteria are satisfied. All other repair and 
maintenance costs are recognized in profit or loss as 
incurred.
An item of property, plant and equipment and any 
significant part initially recognized is derecognized 
upon disposal or when no future economic benefits 
are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss 
arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the 
difference between the net disposal proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset) is included in the income 
statement when the asset is derecognized.
The Group identifies and determines cost of each 
component/ part of the asset separately, if the 
component/ part has a cost which is significant to 
the total cost of the asset and has useful life that is 
materially different from that of the remaining asset.
Capital work- in- progress includes cost of property, 
plant and equipment under installation / under 
development as at the balance sheet date.
The residual values, useful lives and methods of 
depreciation of property, plant and equipment are 
reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted 
prospectively, if appropriate.
In respect to tangible and intangible assets acquired 
under the business transfer agreement, the Group has 
calculated depreciation/amortization on straight-line 
basis using the rates arrived at based on a technical 
estimate of the residual useful lives estimated by an 
independent engineering consultancy professional 
firm. 
In respect of other assets, depreciation is calculated 
on pro rata basis on straight-line basis over estimated 
useful lives estimated by the management and in the 
manner prescribed in Schedule II of the Companies Act 
2013. The useful life is as follows:
Assets
Useful lives estimated 
by the management 
(years)  
Leasehold 
Improvements
Over life of lease or life of 
asset whichever is less

30

(ii) Investment Property
Recognition and initial measurement:
Investment properties are properties held to earn rentals 
or for capital appreciation or both. Investment properties 
are measured initially at their cost of acquisition 
including transaction costs The cost comprises purchase 
price, borrowing cost, if capitalization criteria are met 
and directly attributable cost of bringing the asset to 
its working condition for the intended use. Any trade 
discount and rebates are deducted in arriving at the 
purchase price When significant parts of the investment 
property are required to be replaced at intervals, the 
Company depreciates them separately based on their 
specific useful lives.
Property held under lease is classified as investment 
property when it is held to earn rentals or for capital 
appreciation or for both, rather than for sale in the 
ordinary course of business or for use in production 
or administrative functions. Subsequent costs are 
included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised 
as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is 
probable that future economic benefits associated 
with the item will flow to the Group All other repair 
and maintenance costs are recognised in statement of 
profit and loss as incurred The cost includes the cost 
of replacing parts and borrowing costs for long-term 
construction projects if the recognition criteria are 
met When significant parts of the investment property 
are required to be replaced at intervals, the Group 
depreciates them separately based on their specific 
useful lives All other repair and maintenance costs are 
recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
Depreciation on investment properties is provided on 
the straight-line method, over the useful lives of the 
assets are as follows:

De-recognition
Investment properties are de-recognised either 
when they have been disposed of or when they are 
permanently withdrawn from use and no future 
economic benefit is expected from their disposal. The 
difference between the net disposal proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset is recognised in statement 
of profit and loss in the period of de-recognition.

Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial 
recognition at cost. Following initial recognition, intangible 
assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and 
accumulated impairment losses, if any. Internally generated 
intangibles, excluding capitalized development cost, are 
not capitalized and the related expenditure is reflected 
in statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which the 
expenditure is incurred. Cost comprises the purchase price 
and any attributable cost of bringing the asset to its working 
condition for its intended use.
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either 
finite or indefinite. Intangible assets with finite lives are 
amortized over their useful economic lives and assessed 
for impairment whenever there is an indication that the 
intangible asset may be impaired. The amortization period 
and the amortization method for an intangible asset 
with a finite useful life is reviewed at least at the end of 
each reporting period. Changes in the expected useful 
life or the expected pattern of consumption of future 
economic benefits embodied in the asset is accounted 
for by changing the amortization period or method, as 
appropriate and are treated as changes in accounting 
estimates. The amortization expense on intangible assets 
with finite lives is recognized in the statement of profit and 
loss in the expense category consistent with the function of 
the intangible assets.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not 
amortized, but are tested for impairment annually, 
either individually or at the cash-generating unit level. 
The assessment of indefinite life is reviewed annually to

Strategic Review
Corporate  Review
Financial Review
determine whether the indefinite life continues to be 
supportable. If not, the change in useful life from indefinite 
to finite is made on a prospective basis.
Gains or losses arising from disposal of the intangible assets 
are measured as the difference between the net disposal 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are 
recognized in the statement of profit and loss when the 
assets are disposed off.
Intangible assets with finite useful life are amortized on a 
straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of 3-6 
years.
Research costs are expensed as incurred. Development 
expenditures on an individual project are recognised as an 
intangible asset when the Group can demonstrate:
(a.)	 The technical feasibility of completing the intangible 
asset so that the asset will be available for use or sale
(b.) 	 Its intention to complete and its ability and intention to 
use or sell the asset
(c.)  How the asset will generate future economic benefits
(d.) 	 The availability of resources to complete the asset
(e.) 	 The ability to measure reliably the expenditure during 
development
	
Following 
initial 
recognition 
of 
the 
development 
expenditure as an asset, the asset is carried at cost less any 
accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment 
losses. Amortisation of the asset begins when development 
is complete, and the asset is available for use. It is amortised 
over the period of expected future benefit. Amortisation 
expense is recognised in the statement of profit and loss 
unless such expenditure forms part of carrying value of 
another asset.	
During the period of development, the 
asset is tested for impairment annually.
d. 
Business combinations 
Common 
control 
business 
combinations 
include 
transactions, such as transfer of subsidiaries or businesses, 
between entities within a Company. Business combinations 
involving entities or businesses under common control are 
accounted for using the pooling of interests method. The 
pooling of interest method is considered to involve the 
following: 
(i)	
The assets and liabilities of the combining entities are 
reflected at their carrying amounts. 
(ii)	 No adjustments are made to reflect fair values, or 
recognise any new assets or liabilities. The only 
adjustments that are made are to harmonise 
accounting policies. 
(iii)	 The financial information in the financial statements 
in respect of prior periods is restated as if the business 
combination had occurred from the beginning of 
the preceding period in the financial statements, 
irrespective of the actual date of the combination. 
However, if business combination had occurred after 
that date, the prior period information shall be restated 
only from that date. 
(iv)	 The balance of the retained earnings appearing in the 
financial statements of the transferor is aggregated 
with the corresponding balance appearing in the 
financial statements of the transferee.
e. 
Impairment of non-financial assets
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there 
is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any 
indication exists, or when annual impairment testing 
for an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset’s, 
recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is 
the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s (CGU) 
net fair value less cost of disposal and its value in use. The 
recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, 
unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are 
largely independent of those from other assets or groups of 
assets. Where the carrying amount of asset or CGU exceeds 
its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired 
and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing 
value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted 
to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of 
money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining net 
fair value less cost of disposal, recent market transactions 
are taken into account, if available. If no such transactions 
can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used. 
These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, 
quoted share prices for publicly traded companies or other 
available fair value indicators.
The Group bases its impairment calculation on detailed 
budgets and forecast calculations which are prepared 
separately for each of the Group’s cash-generating units 
to which the individual assets are allocated. These budgets 
and forecast calculations are generally covering a period 
of five years. For the remaining economic life of the asset 
or cash-generating unit (CGU), a long-term growth rate is 
calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the 
fifth year. To estimate cash flow projections beyond periods 
covered by the most recent budgets/forecasts, the Group 
266 | Annual Report 2023-24
Strategic Review
Corporate  Review
Financial Review
extrapolates cash flow projections in the budget using 
a steady or declining growth rate for subsequent years, 
unless an increasing rate can be justified. In this case, the 
growth rate does not exceed the long-term average growth 
rate for the products, industries, country in which the entity 
operates, or for the market in which the asset is used.
Impairment losses including impairment on inventories, are 
recognized in the statement of profit and loss.	
After impairment, depreciation is provided on the revised 
carrying amount of the asset over its remaining economic 
life.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to 
whether there is any indication that previously recognized 
impairment losses no longer exist or may have decreased. 
If such indication exists, the Group estimates the asset’s or 
cash-generating unit’s recoverable amount. A previously 
recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there has 
been a change in the assumptions used to determine the 
asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss 
was recognized. The reversal is limited so that the carrying 
amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, 
nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss 
been recognized for the asset in prior years. Such reversal 
is recognized in the statement of profit and loss unless the 
asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the 
reversal is treated as a revaluation increase.	
Impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets 
with indefinite lives 
Goodwill and intangible assets that have an indefinite useful 
life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually 
for impairment, or more frequently if events or changes 
in circumstances indicate that they might be impaired. 
Other assets are tested for impairment whenever events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount 
may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised 
for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount 
exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is 
the higher of an asset’s fair value less cost of disposal and 
value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, 
assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there 
are separately identifiable cash inflows which are largely 
independent of the cash inflows from other assets or 
groups of assets (cash-generating units). Non – financial 
assets other than goodwill that suffered an impairment are 
reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at the end 
of each reporting period.
Goodwill is not amortised but it is tested for impairment 
annually, or more frequently if events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that it might be impaired, and is 
carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Gains 
and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying 
amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the 
purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to 
those cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating 
units that are expected to benefit from the business 
combination in which the goodwill arose. The units or 
groups of units are identified at the lowest level at which 
goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, 
which in our case are the operating segments.
f. 
Financial I nstruments 
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a 
financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity 
instrument of another entity.
(i) Financial assets
	
The Group classified its financial assets in the following 
measurement categories:
- Those to be measured subsequently at fair value 
(either through other comprehensive income or 
through profit & loss)
- Those measured at amortized cost
Initial recognition and measurement
All financial assets are recognized initially at fair value 
plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair 
value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are 
attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. 
Purchases or sales of financial assets that require 
delivery of assets within a time frame established by 
regulation or convention in the market place (regular 
way trades) are recognized on the trade date, i.e., the 
date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the 
asset. The difference between the transaction amount 
and amortised cost in case of interest free loan to 
subsidiaries based on expected repayment period is 
considered as deemed investment.
Subsequent measurement
For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial 
assets are classified in four categories:
(i)	
Debt instruments at amortized cost	
(ii)	 Debt instruments and equity instruments at fair 
value through profit or loss (FVTPL)
Annual Report 2023-24 | 267 
Strategic Review
Corporate  Review
Financial Review
Debt instruments at amortized cost
A ‘debt instrument’ is measured at the amortized cost if 
both the following conditions are met:
(i) 	 Business model test: The asset is held within a 
business model whose objective is to hold assets 
for collecting contractual cash flows (rather than 
to sell the instrument prior to its contractual 
maturity to realise its fair value change), and
(ii) 	 Cash flow characteristics test: Contractual terms 
of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash 
flows that are solely payments of principal 
and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount 
outstanding.	
This category is the most relevant to the Group. 
After initial measurement, such financial assets are 
subsequently measured at amortized cost using the 
effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortized cost 
is calculated by taking into account any discount or 
premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are 
an integral part of the EIR. EIR is the rate that exactly 
discount the estimated future cash receipts over the 
expected life of the financial instrument or a shorter 
period, where appropriate to the gross carrying 
amount of financial assets. When calculating the 
effective interest rate the Group estimate the expected 
cash flow by considering all contractual terms of the 
financial instruments. The EIR amortization is included 
in finance income in the profit or loss. The losses arising 
from impairment are recognized in the profit or loss. 
This category generally applies to trade and other 
receivables.	
Debt instruments at FVTPL 
FVTPL is a residual category for financial instruments. 
Any financial instrument, which does not meet the 
criteria for amortized cost or FVTOCI, is classified as 
at FVTPL. A gain or loss on a Debt instrument that is 
subsequently measured at FVTPL and is not a part of 
a hedging relationship is recognized in statement of 
profit or loss and presented net in the statement of 
profit and loss within other gains or losses in the period 
in which it arises. Interest income from these Debt 
instruments is included in other income.
Equity investments of other entities 
All equity investments in scope of IND AS 109 are 
measured at fair value. Equity instruments which 
are held for trading and contingent consideration 
recognized by an acquirer in a business combination to 
which IND AS103 applies are classified as at FVTPL. For 
all other equity instruments, the Group may make an 
irrevocable election to present in other comprehensive 
income all subsequent changes in the fair value. The 
Group makes such election on an instrument-by-
instrument basis. The classification is made on initial 
recognition and is irrevocable.	
If the Group decides to classify an equity instrument as 
at FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on the instrument, 
excluding dividends, are recognized in the OCI. There 
is no recycling of the amounts from OCI to profit and 
loss, even on sale of investment. However, the Group 
may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity. 
Equity instruments included within the FVTPL category 
are measured at fair value with all changes recognized 
in the Profit and loss.	
Derecognition 
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a 
financial asset or part of a Group of similar financial 
assets) is primarily derecognized (i.e., removed from the 
Group’s statement of financial position) when:	
-the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have 
expired, or	
-the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash 
flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation 
to pay the received cash flows in full without 
material delay to a third party under a “pass through” 
arrangement and either;	
(a) 	 The Group has transferred the rights to receive 
cash flows from the financial assets or	
(b) 	 The Group has retained the contractual right to 
receive the cash flows of the financial asset, but 
assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash 
flows to one or more recipients.	
Where the Group has transferred an asset, the Group 
evaluates whether it has transferred substantially all 
the risks and rewards of the ownership of the financial 
assets. In such cases, the financial asset is derecognized. 
Where the entity has not transferred substantially all 
the risks and rewards of the ownership of the financial 
268 | Annual Report 2023-24
Strategic Review
Corporate  Review
Financial Review
assets, the financial asset is not derecognized.	
Where the Group has neither transferred a financial 
asset nor retains substantially all risks and rewards of 
ownership of the financial asset, the financial asset is 
derecognized if the Group has not retained control of 
the financial asset. Where the Group retains control 
of the financial asset, the asset is continued to be 
recognized to the extent of continuing involvement in 
the financial asset.
Impairment of financial assets 
In accordance with IND AS 109, the Group applies 
expected credit losses (ECL) model for measurement 
and recognition of impairment loss on the following 
financial asset and credit risk exposure	
- Financial assets measured at amortised cost; e.g. 
Loans, security deposits, trade receivable, bank 
balance.	
- Financial assets measured at fair value through other 
comprehensive income (FVTOCI);	
The Group follows “simplified approach” for recognition 
of impairment loss allowance on trade receivables. 
Under the simplified approach, the Group does not track 
changes in credit risk. Rather, it recognizes impairment 
loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting 
date, right from its initial recognition. the Group uses 
a provision matrix to determine impairment loss 
allowance on the portfolio of trade receivables. The 
provision matrix is based on its historically observed 
default rates over the expected life of trade receivable 
and is adjusted for forward looking estimates. At every 
reporting date, the historical observed default rates are 
updated and changes in the forward looking estimates 
are analysed.	
For recognition of impairment loss on other financial 
assets and risk exposure, the Group determines 
whether there has been a significant increase in the 
credit risk since initial recognition. If credit risk has not 
increased significantly, 12-month ECL is used to provide 
for impairment loss. However, if credit risk has increased 
significantly, lifetime ECL is used. If, in subsequent 
period, credit quality of the instrument improves such 
that there is no longer a significant increase in credit 
risk since initial recognition, then the Group reverts to 
recognizing impairment loss allowance based on 12- 
months ECL.	
Reclassification of financial assets 
The Group determines classification of financial 
assets and liabilities on initial recognition. After 
initial recognition, no reclassification is made for 
financial assets which are equity instruments and 
financial liabilities. For financial assets which are debt 
instruments, a reclassification is made only if there is 
a change in the business model for managing those 
assets. Changes to the business model are expected 
to be infrequent. The Group’s senior management 
determines change in the business model as a result 
of external or internal changes which are significant 
to the Group’s operations. Such changes are evident 
to external parties. A change in the business model 
occurs when the Group either begins or ceases to 
perform an activity that is significant to its operations. 
If the Group reclassifies financial assets, it applies the 
reclassification prospectively from the reclassification 
date which is the first day of the immediately next 
reporting period following the change in business 
model. The Group does not restate any previously 
recognized gains, losses (including impairment gains 
or losses) or interest.	
(ii) Financial liabilities
Initial recognition and measurement 
Financial liabilities are classified at initial recognition 
as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, 
loans and borrowings, and payables, net of directly 
attributable transaction costs. The Group financial 
liabilities include loans and borrowings including bank 
overdraft, trade payable, trade deposits, retention 
money and other payables.	
Subsequent measurement 
The measurement of financial liabilities depends on 
their classification, as described below:	
Trade Payables 
These amounts represent liabilities for goods and 
services provided to the Group prior to the end of 
financial year which are unpaid. Trade and other 
payables are presented as current liabilities unless 
payment is not due within 12 months after the 
reporting period. They are recognised initially at fair 
value and subsequently measured at amortised cost 
using EIR method.	
Annual Report 2023-24 | 269 
Strategic Review
Corporate  Review
Financial Review
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or 
loss 
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss 
include financial liabilities held for trading and financial 
liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair 
value through profit or loss. Financial liabilities are 
classified as held for trading if they are incurred for 
the purpose of repurchasing in the near term. Gains 
or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised 
in the statement of profit and loss. Financial liabilities 
designated upon initial recognition at fair value 
through profit or loss are designated as such at the 
initial date of recognition, and only if the criteria in IND 
AS 109 are satisfied. For liabilities designated as FVTPL, 
fair value gains/ losses attributable to changes in own 
credit risk are recognised in OCI. These gains/ losses 
are not subsequently transferred to profit and loss. 
However, the Group may transfer the cumulative gain 
or loss within equity. All other changes in fair value of 
such liability are recognised in the statement of profit 
or loss. The Group has not designated any financial 
liability as at fair value through profit and loss.	
Loans and borrowings 
Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net 
of transaction cost incurred. After initial recognition, 
interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. 
Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when 
the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the 
EIR amortization process. Amortised cost is calculated 
by taking into account any discount or premium on 
acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part 
of the EIR. The EIR amortization is included as finance 
costs in the statement of profit and loss.	
Financial guarantee contracts 
Financial guarantee contracts issued by the Group are 
those contracts that require a payment to be made to 
reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because the 
specified debtor fails to make a payment when due 
in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. 
Financial guarantee contracts are recognised initially 
as a liability at fair value, adjusted for transaction costs 
that are directly attributable to the issuance of the 
guarantee. Subsequently, the liability is measured at 
the higher of the amount of loss allowance determined 
as per impairment requirements of Ind AS 109 and the 
amount recognised less cumulative amortisation.
Derecognition 
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation 
under the liability is discharged or cancelled or 
expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced 
by another from the same lender on substantially 
different terms, or the terms of an existing liability 
are substantially modified, such an exchange or 
medication is treated as the derecognition of the 
original liability and the recognition of a new liability. 
The difference in the respective carrying amounts is 
recognised in the statement of profit and loss.	
Offsetting of financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset 
and the net amount is reported in the consolidated 
balance sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal 
right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an 
intention to settle on a net basis, to realize the assets 
and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
Compound financial instruments
Compound financial convertible instruments are 
separated into liability and equity components based 
on the terms of the contract. On issuance of the 
convertible instruments, the fair value of the liability 
component is determined using a market rate for an 
equivalent non-convertible instrument. This amount is 
classified as a financial liability measured at amortised 
cost (net of transaction costs) until it is extinguished 
on conversion or redemption. The remainder of the 
proceeds is allocated to the conversion option that is 
recognised and included in equity since conversion 
option meets Ind AS 32 criteria for fixed to fixed 
classification. Transaction costs are deducted from 
equity, net of associated income tax. The carrying 
amount of the conversion option is not remeasured in 
subsequent years. Transaction costs are apportioned 
between the liability and equity components of the 
convertible instruments based on the allocation of 
proceeds to the liability and equity components when 
the instruments are initially recognised.
g. 
Revenue from contracts with customers
Revenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable 
that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the 
revenue can be reliably measured.
The Group has applied five step model as per Ind AS 115 
‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ to recognise 
270 | Annual Report 2023-24
Strategic Review
Corporate  Review
Financial Review
revenue in the Ind AS financial statements. The Group 
satisfies a performance obligation and recognises revenue 
over time, if one of the following criteria is met:
a) 	 The customer simultaneously receives and consumes 
the benefits provided by the Group’s performance as 
the Company performs; or
b) 	 The Group’s performance creates or enhances an asset 
that the customer controls as the asset is created or 
enhanced; or
c) 	 The Group’s performance does not create an asset 
with an alternative use to the Group and the entity 
has an enforceable right to payment for performance 
completed to date.
For performance obligations where any of the above 
conditions are not met, revenue is recognised at the point 
in time at which the performance obligation is satisfied.
Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised 
when control of the goods or services are transferred to 
the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration 
to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for 
those goods or services. The Group has generally concluded 
that it is the principal in its revenue arrangements, because 
it typically controls the goods or services before transferring 
them to the customer. The following specific recognition 
criteria must also be met before revenue is recognized:
Revenue is recognised over period of time in respect of 
rental services on an accrual basis, in accordance with the 
terms of the respective contract as and when the Company 
satisfies performance obligations by delivering the services 
as per contractual agreed terms.
Revenue from shared services 
Revenue is recognised over period of time in respect of 
shares services on an accrual basis, in accordance with the 
terms of the respective contract as and when the Company 
satisfies performance obligations by delivering the services 
as per contractually agreed terms.
Revenue from project management consultancy / 
secondment 
Revenue from project management consultancy / 
secondment is recognized as per the terms of the 
agreement on the basis of services rendered.
Gain on sale of investments 
On disposal of an investment, the difference between the 
carrying amount and net disposal proceeds is recognised 
to the profit and loss statement.
Facility Management
Revenue from facility management is recognised as per the 
terms of the agreement on the basis of services rendered.
Revenue from constructed properties 
Revenue is recognised over time if either of the 
following conditions is met: 
a. 	
Buyers take all the benefits of the property as real 
estate developers construct the property. 
b. 	 Buyers obtain physical possession of the property
c. 	
The property unit to be delivered is specified in 
the contract and real estate entity does not have an 
alternative use of the unit; the buyer does not have the 
discretion to terminate the contract and the entity has 
right to payment for work completed to date. 
In case none of these conditions is met, revenue would 
be recognised at a point in time when the control of the 
property is passed on to the customer.
Contract balances
Contract assets
A contract asset is initially recognised for revenue earned 
from shared services because the receipt of consideration 
is conditional on successful completion of the contract. 
Upon completion of the contract and acceptance by the 
customer, the amount recognised as contract assets is 
reclassified to trade receivables.
Contract assets are subject to impairment assessment. Refer 
to accounting policies on impairment of financial assets in 
section e) Financial instruments – initial recognition and 
subsequent measurement.
Trade receivables
A receivable is recognised if an amount of consideration 
that is unconditional (i.e., only the passage of time is 
required before payment of the consideration is due). 
Refer to accounting policies of financial assets in section e) 
Financial instruments – initial recognition and subsequent 
measurement.
Contract liabilities
A contract liability is recognised if a payment is received or a 
payment is due (whichever is earlier) from a customer before 
the Group transfers the related services. Contract liabilities 
Annual Report 2023-24 | 271 
Strategic Review
Corporate  Review
Financial Review
are recognised as revenue when the Group performs under 
the contract (i.e., transfers control of the related services to 
the customer).
The Group assesses at contract inception whether a contract 
is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract conveys the 
right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of 
time in exchange for consideration.
The specific recognition criteria described below must also 
be met before revenue is recognized.	
h. 
Inventories
Inventories in real estate business 
Inventories also comprise completed units for sale and 
property under construction (Work in progress):	
(A) Completed Unsold inventory is valued at lower of 
cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined by 
including cost of land, materials, services and related 
overheads.	
(B) 	 Work in progress is valued at cost. Cost comprises 
value of land (including development rights), materials, 
services and other overheads related to projects under 
construction.	
i. 
Taxes 
Current income tax 
Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured 
at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to 
the taxation authorities in accordance with the Income 
Tax Act, 1961 and the income computation and disclosure 
standards (ICDS) enacted in India by using tax rates and 
tax laws that are enacted or substantively enacted, at the 
reporting date.	
Current income tax relating to items recognized outside 
profit or loss is recognized outside profit or loss (either in 
other comprehensive income or in equity). Current tax 
items are recognized in correlation to the underlying 
transaction either in OCI or directly in equity. Management 
periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with 
respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are 
subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where 
appropriate.	
Deferred tax 
Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on 
temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting 
purposes at the reporting date. Deferred tax liabilities 
are recognised for all taxable temporary differences 
except:	

When the deferred tax liability arises from the initial 
recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a 
transaction that is not a business combination and, 
at the time of the transaction, affects neither the 
accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss	

In respect of taxable temporary differences associated 
with investments in subsidiaries, associates and 
interests in joint ventures, when the timing of the 
reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled 
and it is probable that the temporary differences will 
not reverse in the foreseeable future
Deferred tax assets are recognized for all deductible 
temporary differences, the carry forward of unused tax 
credits and any unused tax losses. Deferred tax assets are 
recognized to the extent that it is probable that taxable 
profit will be available against which the deductible 
temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax 
credits and unused tax losses can be utilized except:

When the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible 
temporary difference arises from the initial recognition 
of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not 
a business combination and, at the time of the 
transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor 
taxable profit or loss

In respect of deductible temporary differences 
associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates 
and interests in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are 
recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the 
temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable 
future and taxable profit will be available against which 
the temporary differences can be utilised
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed 
at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it 
is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be 
available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be 
utilized. Unrecognized deferred tax assets are re-assessed at 
each reporting date and are recognized to the extent that 
it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow 
the deferred tax asset to be recovered.	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax 
rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset

is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and 
tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted 
at the reporting date.	
Deferred tax relating to items recognized outside profit 
or loss is recognized outside the statement of profit 
or loss (either in other comprehensive income or in 
equity). Deferred tax items are recognized in correlation 
to the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in 
equity.	
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset 
if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax 
assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes 
relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation 
authority.	
GST (Goods and Service tax)/ Sales tax/ value added 
taxes paid on acquisition of assets or on incurring 
expenses 
Expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of 
GST (Goods and Service tax)/ Sales tax/ value added taxes 
paid, except:

When the tax incurred on a purchase of assets or 
services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, 
in which case, the tax paid is recognised as part of the 
cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense 
item, as applicable

When receivables and payables are stated with the 
amount of tax included
The net amount of tax recoverable from, or payable to, the 
taxation authority is included as part of Other current assets 
or liabilities in the balance sheet.	
j. 
Borrowing costs 
Borrowing cost includes interest expense as per effective 
interest rate [EIR]. Borrowing costs directly attributable to 
the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that 
necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready 
for its intended use or sale are capitalized as part of the cost 
of the asset until such time that the asset are substantially 
ready for their intended use. Where fund are borrowed 
specifically to finance a project, the amount capitalized 
represents the actual borrowing incurred. 
Where surplus funds are available out of money borrowed 
specifically to finance project, the income generated 
from such current investments is deducted from the total 
capitalized borrowing cost. Where funds used to finance 
a project form part of general borrowings, the amount 
capitalized is calculated using a weighted average of 
rate applicable to relevant general borrowing of the 
Group during the year. Capitalisation of borrowing cost 
is suspended and charged to profit and loss during the 
extended periods when the active development on the 
qualifying project is interrupted. All other borrowing costs 
are expensed in the period in which they occur. Borrowing 
costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs 
in connection with the borrowing of funds. Borrowing cost 
also includes exchange differences to the extent regarded 
as an adjustment to the borrowing costs.	
k. 
Leases 
The Group assesses at contract inception whether a contract 
is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract conveys the 
right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of 
time in exchange for consideration.
Group as a lessee
The Group applies a single recognition and measurement 
approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and 
leases of low-value assets. The Group recognises lease 
liabilities to make lease payments and right-of-use assets 
representing the right to use the underlying assets.
i)    R ight-of-use assets
	
The Group recognises right-of-use assets at the 
commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the 
underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use 
assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for 
any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-
of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities 
recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease 
payments made at or before the commencement date 
less any lease incentives received. Right-of-use assets 
are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter 
of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the 
assets.
	
If ownership of the leased asset transfers to the Group 
at the end of the lease term or the cost reflects the 
exercise of a purchase option, depreciation is calculated 
using the estimated useful life of the asset.
	
The right-of-use assets are also subject to impairment. 
Refer to the accounting policies in section (d) 
Impairment of non-financial assets.
ii)   Lease Liabilities
Annual Report 2023-24 | 273 
Strategic Review
Corporate  Review
Financial Review
	
At the commencement date of the lease, the Group 
recognises lease liabilities measured at the present 
value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. 
The lease payments include fixed payments (including 
in substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives 
receivable, variable lease payments that depend on 
an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid 
under residual value guarantees. The lease payments 
also include the exercise price of a purchase option 
reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and 
payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the 
lease term reflects the Group exercising the option to 
terminate. Variable lease payments that do not depend 
on an index or a rate are recognised as expenses 
(unless they are incurred to produce inventories) in the 
period in which the event or condition that triggers the 
payment occurs.
	
In calculating the present value of lease payments, 
the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate at 
the lease commencement date because the interest 
rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. 
After the commencement date, the amount of lease 
liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest 
and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, 
the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured 
if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, 
a change in the lease payments (e.g., changes to 
future payments resulting from a change in an index 
or rate used to determine such lease payments) or a 
change in the assessment of an option to purchase the 
underlying asset.
	
The Group’s lease liabilities are included in Interest-
bearing loans and borrowings.
iii) Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets
	
The Group applies the short-term lease recognition 
exemption to its short-term leases of equipment (i.e., 
those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or 
less from the commencement date and do not contain 
a purchase option). It also applies the lease of low-
value assets recognition exemption to leases of office 
equipment that are considered to be low value. Lease 
payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value 
assets are recognised as expense on a straight-line 
basis over the lease term.
Group as a lessor
Leases in which the Group does not transfer 
substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to 
ownership of an asset are classified as operating leases. 
Rental income arising is accounted for on a straight-line 
basis over the lease terms. Initial direct costs incurred 
in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are 
added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and 
recognised over the lease term on the same basis as 
rental income. Contingent rents are recognised as 
revenue in the period in which they are earned.
l. 
Provision and Contingent liabilities 
Provisions 
A provision is recognized when the Group has a present 
obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of past event, 
it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying 
economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation 
and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the 
obligation. Provisions are not discounted to their present 
value and are determined based on the best estimate 
required to settle the obligation at the reporting date. These 
estimates are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted 
to reflect the current best estimates.	
Contingent liabilities 
A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises 
from past events whose existence will be confirmed by the 
occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain 
future events beyond the control of the Group or a present 
obligation that is not recognized because it is not probable 
that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the 
obligation. A contingent liability also arises in extremely rare 
cases, where there is a liability that cannot be recognized 
because it cannot be measured reliably. the Group does not 
recognize a contingent liability but discloses its existence in 
the financial statements unless the probability of outflow of 
resources is remote.	
Provisions, contingent liabilities, contingent assets and 
commitments are reviewed at each balance sheet 
date.	
m. Retirement and other employee benefits 
	Provident fund 
The Group has contributed to employees provident fund 
benefits through a trust “Max Financial Services Limited 
Provident Fund Trust” managed by Max Financial Services 
Limited (erstwhile Max India Limited) whereby amounts 
determined at a fixed percentage of basic salaries of the 
employees are deposited to the trust every month. The 
274 | Annual Report 2023-24
Strategic Review
Corporate  Review
Financial Review
benefit vests upon commencement of the employment. 
The interest rate payable by the trust to the beneficiaries 
every year is notified by the government and the Group has 
an obligation to make good the shortfall, if any, between 
the return from the investments of the trust and the notified 
interest rate. The Group has obtained actuarial valuation 
to determine the shortfall, if any, as at the Balance Sheet 
date. The Group recognizes contribution payable to the 
provident fund as an expense, when the employee renders 
the related service.	
Gratuity 
Gratuity liability is a defined benefit obligation and is 
provided for on the basis of an actuarial valuation on 
projected unit credit method made at the end of each 
financial year. Max Speciality Films Limited, subsidiary 
of the Company has also made contribution to Life 
Insurance Corporation (LIC) towards a policy to cover 
the gratuity liability of the employees to an extent. The 
difference between the actuarial valuation of the gratuity 
of employees at the year-end and the balance of funds with 
LIC is provided for as liability in the books.	
Remeasurements, comprising of actuarial gains and losses, 
the effect of the asset ceiling, excluding amounts included 
in net interest on the net defined benefit liability and the 
return on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net 
interest on the net defined benefit liability), are recognized 
immediately in the Balance Sheet with a corresponding 
debit or credit to retained earnings through OCI in the 
period in which they occur. Remeasurements are not 
reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods.	
Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate 
to the net defined benefit (liabilities/assets). The Group 
recognized the following changes in the net defined benefit 
obligation under employee benefit expenses in statement 
of profit and loss	
(i) 	 Service cost comprising current service cost, past 
service cost, gain & loss on curtailments and non-
routine settlements.	
(ii) 	 Net interest expenses or income	
	Compensated absences 
Accumulated leave, which is expected to be utilized within 
the next 12 months, is treated as short-term employee 
benefit .The Group measures the expected cost of such 
absences as the additional amount that it expects to pay as 
a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at 
the reporting date.	
The Group treats accumulated leave expected to be carried 
forward beyond twelve months, as long-term employee 
benefit for measurement purposes. Such long-term 
compensated absences are provided for based on the 
actuarial valuation using the projected unit credit method 
at the year end. Actuarial gains/losses are immediately taken 
to the statement of profit and loss and are not deferred. The 
Group presents the leave as a current liability in the balance 
sheet as the Company does not have an unconditional right 
to defer its settlement for 12 months after the reporting 
date.	
Short-term obligations 
Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary 
benefits that are expected to be settled wholly within twelve 
months after the end of the period in which the employees 
render the related service are recognized in respect of 
employee service upto the end of the reporting period and 
are measured at the amount expected to be paid when the 
liabilities are settled. the liabilities are presented as current 
employee benefit obligations in the balance sheet.	
Long term incentive plan 
Employees of the Group receives defined incentive, 
whereby employees render services for a specified period. 
Long term incentive is measured on accrual basis over the 
period as per the terms of contract.
n. 
Share-based payments
	Employees of the Company receive remuneration in 
the form of share based payment transaction, whereby 
employees render services as a consideration for equity 
instruments (equity- settled transactions).	
	Equity-settled transactions 
The cost of equity-settled transactions is determined by 
the fair value at the date when the grant is made using an 
appropriate valuation model.	
That cost is recognized, together with a corresponding 
increase in share-based payment (SBP) reserves in equity, 
over the period in which the performance and/or service 
conditions are fulfilled in employee benefits expense. 
The cumulative expense recognized for equity-settled 
transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date 
reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired 
and the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity 
instruments that will ultimately vest. The statement of 
profit and loss expense or credit for a period represents 
the movement in cumulative expense recognized as at 
Annual Report 2023-24 | 275 
Strategic Review
Corporate  Review
Financial Review
the beginning and end of that period and is recognized in 
employee benefits expense.	
Service and non-market performance conditions are not 
taken into account when determining the grant date fair 
value of awards, but the likelihood of the conditions being 
met is assessed as part of the Group’s best estimate of the 
number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. 
Market performance conditions are reflected within the 
grant date fair value. Any other conditions attached to an 
award, but without an associated service requirement, 
are considered to be non-vesting conditions. Non-vesting 
conditions are reflected in the fair value of an award and 
lead to an immediate expensing of an award unless there 
are also service and/or performance conditions.	
No expense is recognized for awards that do not ultimately 
vest because non-market performance and/or service 
conditions have not been met. Where awards include a 
market or non-vesting condition, the transactions are treated 
as vested irrespective of whether the market or non-vesting 
condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance 
and/or service conditions are satisfied.	
When the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, 
the minimum expense recognized is the expense had the 
terms had not been modified, if the original terms of the 
award are met. An additional expense is recognized for any 
modification that increases the total fair value of the share-
based payment transaction or is otherwise beneficial to the 
employee as measured at the date of modification. Where 
an award is cancelled by the entity or by the counterparty, 
any remaining element of the fair value of the award is 
expensed immediately through profit or loss.	
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as 
additional share dilution in the computation of diluted 
earnings per share.	
o. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalent in the balance sheet comprise 
cash at banks and on hand and short-term deposits with an 
original maturity of three months or less, which are subject 
to an insignificant risk of changes in value.	
p. 
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the 
net profit or loss for the period attributable to equity 
shareholders by the weighted average number of equity 
shares outstanding during the period. The weighted 
average number of equity shares outstanding during the 
period is adjusted for events such as bonus issue, bonus 
element in a rights issue, share split, and reverse share split 
(consolidation of shares) that have changed the number of 
equity shares outstanding, without a corresponding change 
in resources. For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings 
per share, the net profit or loss for the year attributable to 
equity shareholders of the parent company and weighted 
average number of shares outstanding during the period 
are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential equity 
shares 	
q. 
Foreign currencies 
	Items included in the financial statements are measured 
using the currency of the primary economic environment 
in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’). 
The Group’s consolidated Ind AS financial statements are 
presented in Indian rupee (Rs.) which is also the Group’s 
functional and presentation currency.	
Foreign currency transactions are recorded on initial 
recognition in the functional currency, using the exchange 
rate prevailing at the date of transaction. However, for 
practical reasons, the Group uses an average rate if the 
average approximates the actual rate at the time of the 
transaction.	
Measurement of foreign currency items at the balance 
sheet date	
Foreign 
currency 
monetary 
assets 
and 
liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the 
functional currency spot rates of exchange at the reporting 
date.	
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of 
historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the 
exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-
monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency 
are translated using the exchange rates at the date when 
the fair value is determined.
r. 
Fair value measurement
	The Group measures financial instruments, such as, 
derivatives at fair value at each balance sheet date.	
276 | Annual Report 2023-24
Strategic Review
Corporate  Review
Financial Review
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an 
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the measurement date. The 
fair value measurement is based on the presumption that 
the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes 
place either:
(i)	
In the principal market for the asset or liability, 
or	
(ii)	 In the absence of a principal market, in the most 
advantageous market for the asset or liability	
The principal or the most advantageous market must be 
accessible by the Group.	
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using 
the assumptions that market participants would use 
when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market 
participants act in their economic best interest.	
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into 
account a market participant’s ability to generate economic 
benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by 
selling it to another market participant that would use the 
asset in its highest and best use.	
The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in 
the circumstances and for which sufficient date are available 
to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant 
observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable 
inputs.	
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured 
or disclosed in the financial statements are categorized 
within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based 
on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement as a whole:	
Level 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active 
markets for identical assets or liabilities 
Level 2 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level 
input that is significant to the fair value measurement is 
directly or indirectly observable	
Level 3 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level 
input that is significant to the fair value measurement is 
unobservable	
For assets and liabilities that are recognized in the financial 
statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines 
whether transfers have occurred between levels in the 
hierarchy by re-assessing categorization (based on the 
lowest level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting 
period.	
The Group’s management determines the policies and 
procedures for both recurring and non-recurring fair value 
measurement, such as derivative instruments measured at 
fair value.	
External valuers are involved for valuation of significant 
assets, such as properties and financial assets and significant 
liabilities. Involvement of external valuers is decided 
upon annually by the management. The management 
decides, after discussions with the Group’s external valuers 
which valuation techniques and inputs to use for each 
case.	
At each reporting date, the management analyses the 
movements in the values of assets and liabilities which are 
required to be remeasured or re-assessed as per the Group’s 
accounting policies.	
The management in conjunction with the Group’s external 
valuers, also compares the change in the fair value of 
each asset and liability with relevant external sources to 
determine whether the change is reasonable.	
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has 
determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of 
the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability 
and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained 
above	
This note summarises accounting policy for fair value. 
Other fair value related disclosures are given in the relevant 
notes.

Government Grants  
Government grants are recognized where there is 
reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all 
attached conditions will be complied with. When the grant 
relates to an expense item, it is recognized as income on a 
systematic basis over the periods that the related costs, for 
which it is intended to compensate, are expensed. When 
Annual Report 2023-24 | 277 
Strategic Review
Corporate  Review
Financial Review
the grant relates to an asset, it is recognized as income on 
the basis of accomplishment of export obligations.	
The Group has inventorized the duty saved on import 
of raw material and recognised Government grant as 
liability. Deferred income is recognised in statement of 
profit and loss as and when export obligations are fulfiled 
and government grant is reduced by deferred income 
recognised.	
2.3 Accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
The preparation of the Group’s Consolidated Ind AS financial 
statements requires management to make judgements, estimates 
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, 
expenses, assets and liabilities, and the grouping disclosures, 
and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about 
these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that 
require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the 
asset or liability affected in future periods.	
Judgements 
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, 
management has made the following judgements, which have 
the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the 
financial statements.	
(a) Operating 
lease 
commitments 
- 
Group 
as 
lessee 
The Group has taken various commercial properties on 
leases. the Group has determined, based on an evaluation 
of the terms and conditions of the arrangements, such as 
the lease term not constituting a substantial portion of the 
economic life of the commercial property, and that it does 
not retain all the significant risks and rewards of ownership 
of these properties and accounts for the contracts as 
operating leases. Refer Note 4b.	
	Estimates and assumptions
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key 
sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, 
that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment 
to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within 
the next financial year, are described below. The Group 
based its assumptions and estimates on parameters 
available when the financial statements were prepared. 
Existing circumstances and assumptions about future 
developments, however, may change due to market 
changes or circumstances arising that are beyond the 
control of the Group. Such changes are reflected in the 
assumptions when they occur.	
(a) Taxes 
	
Uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation 
of complex tax regulations, changes in tax laws, and 
the amount and timing of future taxable income. 
Given the wide range of business relationships and 
the long-term nature and complexity of existing 
contractual agreements, differences arising between 
the actual results and the assumptions made, or future 
changes to such assumptions, could necessitate 
future adjustments to tax income and expense already 
recorded. The Group establishes provisions, based on 
reasonable estimates. The amount of such provisions 
is based on various factors, such as experience of 
previous tax audits and differing interpretations of tax 
regulations by the taxable entity and the responsible 
tax authority. Such differences of interpretation may 
arise on a wide variety of issues depending on the 
conditions prevailing in the respective domicile of the 
companies.	
(b) Defined benefit plans 
	
The cost of defined benefit plans (i.e. Gratuity benefit) 
is determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial 
valuation involves making various assumptions which 
may differ from actual developments in the future. 
These include the determination of the discount 
rate, future salary increases, mortality rates. Due 
to the complexity of the valuation, the underlying 
assumptions and its long-term nature, a defined 
benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in 
these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at 
each reporting date. In determining the appropriate 
discount rate, management considers the interest rates 
of long-term government bonds where remaining 
maturity if such bond corresponding to the expected 
duration of the defined benefit obligation. The 
mortality rate is based on publicly available mortality 
tables for the specific countries. Future salary increases 
and pension increases are based on expected future 
inflation rates. Further details about the assumptions 
used, including a sensitivity analysis, are given in Note 
36.	
(c) Fair 
value 
measurement 
of 
financial 
instrument 
	
When the fair value of financial assets and financial 
liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be 
measured based on quoted prices in active markets, 
their fair value is measured using valuation techniques 
278 | Annual Report 2023-24
Strategic Review
Corporate  Review
Financial Review
including the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. The 
inputs to these models are taken from observable 
markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, 
a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair 
values. Judgements include considerations of inputs 
such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes 
in assumptions about these factors could affect the 
reported fair value of financial instruments. The Group 
uses Net asset value for valuation of investment in 
mutual funds. Refer Note 39 related to Fair value 
disclosures.	
	
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS:
	
Amended standards adopted by the Group
(i) 
Definition 
of A
ccounting 
Estimates 
- 
Amendments to I nd A S 8
	
The amendments clarify the distinction between 
changes in accounting estimates and changes 
in accounting policies and the correction of 
errors. It has also been clarified how entities use 
measurement techniques and inputs to develop 
accounting estimates.
	
The amendments does not have any material 
impact on the consolidated financial statements 
as there is no change in accounting estimates and 
changes in accounting policies and the correction 
of errors.
(ii) 
Disclosure 
of A
ccounting 
Policies 
- 
Amendments to I nd A S 1
	
The amendments aim to help entities provide 
accounting policy disclosures that are more 
useful by replacing the requirement for entities 
to disclose their ‘significant’ accounting policies 
with a requirement to disclose their ‘material’ 
accounting policies and adding guidance on how 
entities apply the concept of materiality in making 
decisions about accounting policy disclosures.
	
The Group has given accounting policies 
disclosures to ensure consistency with the 
amended requirements.
(iii) Deferred T ax related to A ssets and Liabilities 
arising 
from 
a 
Single T
ransaction 
- 
Amendments to I nd A S 12
	
The amendments narrow the scope of the initial 
recognition exception under Ind AS 12, so that 
it no longer applies to transactions that give 
rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary 
differences.
	
The 
amendments 
should 
be 
applied 
to 
transactions that occur on or after the beginning 
of the earliest comparative period presented. 
In addition, at the beginning of the earliest 
comparative period presented, a deferred tax 
asset (provided that sufficient taxable profit is 
available) and a deferred tax liability should also 
be recognised for all deductible and taxable 
temporary differences associated with leases and 
decommissioning 
obligations. 
Consequential 
amendments have been made in Ind AS 101. 
	
The amendments does not have any material 
impact on the financial statements.

category of the property being valued. The fair value has been arrived using discounted cash flow projections based on reliable 
estimates of future cash flows considering growth in rental of 15% on every 3 years, liquidity discount of 15% and discount rate 
of 10-12% (previous year 12%).

Description of risk exposures
	
Valuations are based on certain assumptions, which are dynamic in nature and vary over time. As such the Company is exposed to various 
risks as follows:
i)	
Salary Increases- Actual salary increases will increase the Plan’s liability. Increase in salary increase rate assumption in future valuations 
will also increase the liability.
ii)	
Discount Rate : Reduction in discount rate in subsequent valuations can increase the plan’s liability.
iii)	 Mortality & disability – Actual deaths & disability cases proving lower or higher than assumed in the valuation can impact the liabilities.
iv)	 Investment Risk – If Plan is funded then assets liabilities mismatch & actual investment return on assets lower than the discount rate 
assumed at the last valuation date can impact the liability

The estimates of rate of escalation in salary considered in actuarial valuation are after taking into account inflation, seniority, 
promotion and other relevant factors including supply and demand in the employment market. The above information is as 
certified by the actuary. 
k)	
Discount rate is based on the prevailing market yields of Indian Government securities as at the balance sheet date for the 
estimated term of the obligations.
l)	
The sensitivity analysis above have been determined based on a method that extrapolates the impact on defined benefit 
obligation as a result of reasonable changes in key assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period.
m)	 Risk Exposure
	
Valuations are performed on certain basic set of pre-determined assumptions and other regulatory framework which may vary 
over time. Thus, the Group is exposed to various risks in providing the above gratuity benefit which are as follows: 
 
Interest R ate risk: The plan exposes the Group to the risk of fall in interest rates. A fall in interest rates will result in an increase in 
the ultimate cost of providing the above benefit and will thus result in an increase in the value of the liability (as shown in financial 
statements). 
 
Liquidity R isk: This is the risk that the Group is not able to meet the short-term gratuity payouts. This may arise due to non 
availability of enough cash / cash equivalent to meet the liabilities or holding of illiquid assets not being sold in time. 
 
Salary Escalation R isk: The present value of the defined benefit plan is calculated with the assumption of salary increase rate 
of plan participants in future. Deviation in the rate of increase of salary in future for plan participants from the rate of increase in 
salary used to determine the present value of obligation will have a bearing on the plan’s liability. 
 
Demographic R isk: The Group has used certain mortality and attrition assumptions in valuation of the liability. The Group is 
exposed to the risk of actual experience turning out to be worse compared to the assumption.
36	 During the pervious year, Max Estates Gurgaon Limited(MEGL), a wholly owned subsidiary of Max Estates Limited, has entered into a Joint 
Development Agreement (JDA) for the development of land parcels. MEGL has paid to the land owners a sum of Rs. 9,395 lakhs (March 31,

effect from April 01, 2022 (‘Appointed Date’) to comply with the accounting treatment prescribed in the Scheme, which is in compliance 
with the MCA general circular no. 09/2019 dated August 21, 2019.

business combination from the combination date (i.e., the date on which control has been transferred) or the earliest date presented in the 
financial statements, whichever is later i.e. April 1, 2022.

The Group management assessed that all current assets and current liabilities carrying value included in the above table are considered to 
be same as their fair value.
	
The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities is included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current 
transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. The following methods and assumptions were used to 
estimate the fair values:
	
Long term borrowings are primarily bearing floating rate of interest with periodic reset of one year. Management has assessed carrying 
value of these instruments to approximate the fair value

Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or 
indirectly
Level 3: techniques that use inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data

39  Financial risk management objectives and policies
	
The Group has instituted an overall risk management programme which also focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks 
to minimize potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. The Group uses forward covers to hedge foreign currency 
risk exposures. Financial risk management is carried out by Banking and Forex department under policies approved by the Board of 
Directors from time to time. The Banking and Forex department, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the various 
stakeholders. The Board of Directors approves written principles for overall financial risk management, as well as written policies covering 
specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments.
	
The Group is exposed to market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. These risks are managed pro-actively by the Senior Management of the 
Group, duly supported by various Groups and Committees.
a) 
Liquidity risk 
	
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they become due. The Group employees 
prudent liquidity risk management practices which inter alia means maintaining sufficient cash and the availability of funding through 
an adequate amount of committed credit facilities. Given the nature of the underlying businesses, the corporate finance maintains 
flexibility in funding by maintaining availability under committed credit lines and this way liquidity risk is mitigated by the availability 
of funds to cover future commitments. Cash flow forecasts are prepared and the utilized borrowing facilities are monitored on a daily 
basis and there is adequate focus on good management practices whereby the collections are managed efficiently. The Group while 
borrowing funds for large capital project, negotiates the repayment schedule in such a manner that these match with the generation 
of cash on such investment. Longer term cash flow forecasts are updated from time to time and reviewed by the Senior management 
of the Group.

b) Credit risk
	
Credit Risk is the risk that the counter party will not meet its obligation under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to 
a financial loss. The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade receivables) , including deposits with 
banks, foreign exchange transactions and other financial assets.
(i) Trade receivables
	
Customer credit risk is managed subject to the Group’s established policy, procedures and control relating to customer credit 
risk management. Management evaluate credit risk relating to customers on an ongoing basis. Receivable control management 
team assesses the credit quality of the customer, taking into account its financial position, past experience and other factors. 
Outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored and any shipments to major customers are generally covered by letters 
of credit or other forms of credit insurance. An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date on group\category 
basis. The calculation is based on exchange losses historical data and available facts as on date of evaluation. Trade receivables 
comprise a widespread customer base. The Group evaluates the concentration of risk with respect to trade receivables as low, as 
its customers are located in several jurisdictions and industries and operate in largely independent markets.
(ii) Financial instruments and cash deposit
	
Credit risk from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed by the Group’s treasury department in accordance 
with the Group’s policy. Investments of surplus funds are made in bank deposits and other risk free securities. The limits are set 
to minimize the concentration of risks and therefore mitigate financial loss through counter party’s potential failure to make 
payments. Credit limits of all authorities are reviewed by the management on regular basis. All balances with banks and financial 
institutions is subject to low credit risk due to good credit ratings assigned to the Group.
c) 
Market risk
	
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market 
prices. Market risks comprises three types of risk: currency rate risk, interest rate risk and other price risks, such as equity price risk and 
commodity price risk. Financial instruments affected by market risks include loans and borrowings, deposits, investments and foreign 
currency receivables and payables. The sensitivity analyses in the following sections relate to the position as at March 31, 2023 and 
March 31, 2024. The analyses exclude the impact of movements in market variables on; the carrying values of gratuity and other post-
retirement obligations; provisions; and the non-financial assets and liabilities. The sensitivity of the relevant Profit and Loss item is the 
effect of the assumed changes in the respective market risks. This is based on the financial assets and financial liabilities held as of 
March 31, 2023, and March 31, 2024.

and Allotment of Securities) Rules, 2014 and the Companies 
(Share Capital and Debentures) Rules, 2014), each including any 
amendment(s), statutory modification(s), or re-enactment(s) 
thereof; and (c) other applicable law including the Securities and 
Exchange Board of India (Issue and Listing of Non-Convertible 
Securities) Regulations, 2021, as amended. Accordingly, the Board, 
at its meeting held on July 15, 2024, subject to the approval of the 
members of the Company, approved the issuance of Securities at 
such price and on such terms and conditions as may be deemed 
appropriate by the Board at its sole and absolute discretion, taking 
into consideration market conditions and other relevant factors 
and wherever necessary, in consultation with the book running 
lead manager(s) and/or other advisor(s) appointed in accordance 
with applicable laws, and subject to regulatory approvals (as 
necessary). The Board may, at its discretion, adopt any one or 
more of the mechanisms prescribed above to meet its objectives 
as stated in the aforesaid paragraphs without the need for fresh 
approval from the shareholders of the Company. 
In connection with the proposed issue of securities, the Company 
is required, inter alia, to prepare various documentation and 
execute various agreements. The special resolution also seeks to 
give the Board powers to issue Securities in one or more tranche 
or tranches, at such time or times, at such price or prices and 
to such person(s), including institutions, incorporated bodies, 
qualified institutions, buyers and/or individuals or otherwise as the 
Board in its absolute discretion deem fit. The resolution proposed 
is an enabling resolution, and the exact price, proportion and 
timing of the issue of the Securities in one or more tranches and 
the remaining detailed terms and conditions for the Issue will be 
decided by the Board in accordance with the ICDR Regulations 
and such other applicable laws, in consultation with book 
running lead manager(s) and/or other advisor(s) appointed in 
relation to the Issue and such other authorities and agencies as 
may be required to be consulted by the Company, considering 
the prevailing market conditions and in accordance with the 
applicable provisions of law and other relevant factors. 
Further, the Company is yet to identify the investor(s) and decide 
the quantum of Securities to be issued to them. Hence, the 
details of the proposed allottees, percentage of their post Issue 
shareholding and the shareholding pattern of the Company are not 
provided. The proposal, therefore, seeks to confer upon the Board 
Notice

the absolute discretion and adequate flexibility to determine the 
terms of the Issue, including but not limited to the identification 
of the proposed investors in the Issue and the quantum of 
Securities to be issued and allotted to each such investor, in 
accordance with the provisions of the ICDR Regulations, the

Act, 1999 and the regulations made thereunder, including the

it is proposed to increase the issued capital of a company by 
allotment of further equity shares, such further equity shares shall 
be offered to the existing shareholders of such company in the 
manner laid down therein unless the shareholders by way of a 
special resolution decide otherwise. Since the special resolution 
proposed may result in the issue of Equity Shares of the Company 
to persons other than existing Members of the Company, approval 
of the shareholders is also being sought pursuant to the provisions 
of Section 62(1)(c) and other applicable provisions of the Act, 
as well as applicable rules notified by the Ministry of Corporate 
Affairs and in terms of the provisions of the Listing Regulations, 
as amended. Further, in terms of provisions of Section 42 and 71

and Debentures) Rules, 2014, a company can issue its securities 
including debentures on private placement basis after obtaining 
prior approval of the members of the Company by a special 
resolution. Therefore, the consent of the Shareholders is being 
sought for passing the special resolution, pursuant to applicable 
provisions of the Act and other applicable laws.
The Securities offered, issued, and allotted by the Company 
pursuant to the Issue in terms of the resolution would be subject 
to the provisions of the memorandum of association and articles 
of association of the Company and any Equity Shares that may be 
created, offered, issued and allotted by the Company pursuant to

Equity Shares of the Company. The Securities to be allotted 
would be listed on the Stock Exchanges, as may be required. The 
offer/issue/allotment would be subject to the availability of the

by foreign investors into Equity Shares, if any, would be subject
