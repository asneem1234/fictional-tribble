●	
Department heads, in consultation with the EHS head, are made responsible for identifying hazards and associated 
risks in their activities and equipment, as well as implementing recommended corrective actions.
	
	
●	
Croner’s “nomogram” tool is used to assess risk rating of hazard based on the factors such as likelihood of 
occurrence, frequency of exposure, extent of harm, severity, and property damage. Engineering, administrative, 
and PPE controls are applied to eliminate or reduce the OHS risk of identified hazards to an acceptable level.
	
	
●	
To improve the hazard and near-miss identification process, employees of all levels are involved and made 
responsible for risk mitigation in the workplace.
	
	
●	
The site leadership team consists of the plant heads and all department heads who have been trained on 
the IS14489 OHS auditing standard and employees trained on ISO 45001 Internal auditor training course for 
identifying hazards and risks in the plant premises. Daily OHS inspections are performed by the EHS head in 
collaboration with the corresponding area owner, weekly by the plant head, and monthly by other HODs. Every 
weekend, observations from these inspections are collected and shared with the Global EHS head and the Global 
manufacturing head to review its compliance. On a monthly basis, the same information is presented to President 
of Operations.
