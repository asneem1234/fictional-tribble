26.	 Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues:
	
The Company undertook a structured materiality assessment exercise in the financial year 2022-23 which was reviewed in 
2023-24. The process involved peer benchmarking and one-to-one interactions with the executive leadership, business unit 
heads, and functional heads to obtain the priorities of the specific stakeholder groups they interface with. These were then 
aligned with the Board and leadership’s ESG ambitions. Indicated below are critical material responsible business conduct and 
sustainability issues about environmental and social matters that present a risk or an opportunity to the Company’s businesses.

Financial 
implications 
of the risk or

1.
Energy and GHG 
Emissions 
Risk and 
Opportunity
(Risk):
Dependence on non-renewable energy 
sources coupled with inefficient energy 
use poses a significant challenge for 
businesses. Energy prices also impact the 
costs of the operations. Implementation 
of a carbon tax could escalate costs 
further, exacerbating financial burdens. 
Real estate activities contribute to 
greenhouse gas emissions which can 
lead to displaced communities and make 
them vulnerable to climate-related risks.
(Opportunity):
Green 
Buildings 
and 
low 
GHG 
emissions are crucial for current as 
well as potential occupiers. Occupiers, 
Exhibitors and Indabrator customers 
prefer more sustainable facilities and 
operations. Focus on GHG reduction 
enhances business opportunities and 
builds resilience amid climate change 
adaptation needs.
As part of the BRSR disclosure, Nesco has 
initiated the inventory and calculation 
of GHG emissions. The IT Parks business 
is the Company’s largest business and 
purchases only Green Energy for its 
energy requirements. The Company is 
developing a strategy for reductions in 
energy usage and GHG Emissions for its 
other business units. The risk mitigation 
efforts will protect the Company from 
downside risks.
The Company’s approach to reducing 
energy consumption and GHG Emissions 
is discussed in Annexure C of the 
Annual Report and Principle 6, Essential 
Indicator 8.
Positive
2.
Waste 
Management
Risk 
Efficient waste management is essential 
to optimise resource usage and mitigate 
environmental 
impact. 
Compliance 
with waste management and disposal 
regulations is an essential component 
of ensuring smooth business operations. 
Waste management is also a social 
impact issue for the communities within 
which the Company operates.
Non-compliance may result in fines, 
and litigation, and could also harm its 
reputation and social ‘licence to operate’. 
Nesco’s Goregaon facilities are accessed 
by a variety of stakeholders and hence 
the coverage goes beyond activities 
within its direct control.
The Company has adopted streamlined 
waste 
management 
protocols 
to 
ensure compliance. In addition, there 
is an emphasis on awareness of waste 
segregation supported by disposal with 
recycling and reuse as the intended 
end use. The Company is evaluating 
expanding Organic Waste Composting, 
for improving soil quality and fostering 
green cover and biodiversity.
The Company’s strategy for Waste 
Management has been discussed in 
detail in Principle 6, Essential Indicator 
10.
 Negative
3.
Water Management Risk
Ensuring 
compliance 
with 
water 
regulations is crucial to safeguard 
groundwater 
resources 
and 
avoid 
regulatory 
penalties. 
Uncontrolled 
consumption 
can 
impact 
water 
availability 
for 
the 
Company’s 
communities and its own operations 
while 
non-compliance 
can 
undermine occupier confidence, and 
impede 
future 
project 
approvals. 
The 
Company 
has 
implemented 
initiatives 
for 
reducing 
water 
consumption 
and 
conservation 
of 
water. Nesco has invested in rainwater 
harvesting, Sewage Treatment Plants 
(“STP”), and adding water meters as well 
as IoT solutions to improve monitoring 
and drive efficiencies. The Company 
will be refreshing its water balance to 
reassess its water requirements due to 
the impact of the new infrastructure 
being added  to its operational footprint. 
Through the implementation of water-
saving technologies and responsible 
usage, the Company aims to mitigate 
resource depletion risks.
Additional details are mentioned in 
Principle 6, Essential Indicator 5.

Health Safety and 
Well-being
 Risk
Ensuring the health and safety of 
employees, workers, and contractual 
workforce is imperative for all Nesco 
businesses. The health and safety 
context for the Company is broader 
due to its obligation to ensure safety for 
employees of occupiers, their visitors 
as well as other visitors for Exhibitions, 
Events, Restaurants and the food court. 
Adherence to safety regulations, incident 
prevention, mitigation and response to 
hazards help address concerns about 
negligence 
claims, 
compensation 
requests, and reputational harm to the 
Company. The intensity of activity during 
exhibitions and events heightens the 
risk of accidents, potentially resulting in 
accidents, and/or injuries.
Nesco 
invests 
in 
infrastructure, 
systems and a safety team besides 
training its employees and workers 
across its businesses. The Company 
takes the responsibility to create a 
safe environment for all internal and 
external stakeholders on its premises. 
It invests in the infrastructure and 
awareness of safety protocols through 
appropriate signages related to a variety 
of hazards. Nesco also provides training 
to its outsourced security and facility 
management personnel who engage 
with visitors and are accessible to 
address any safety risks.
Health and Safety Risk Management 
Processes are detailed in Principle 3, 
Essential Indicators 10-15.
 Negative
5.
Human Capital 
Management
Opportunity and  
Risk
(Opportunity):
Effective management of a diverse 
workforce results in increased resilience 
and productivity. The areas of concern 
include fair compensation, learning 
opportunities, 
career 
development 
and fostering inclusivity in the work 
environment.
(Risk):
There 
is 
significant 
reliance 
on 
contractual 
labour 
within 
Nesco’s 
operations which introduces compliance 
and operational risks.
Human capital management, covering 
benefits, training, career development, 
retention, safety, and other pertinent 
aspects are discussed in detail in 
Principle 3 and Principle 5.
Nesco has set processes to mitigate 
labour-related 
risks 
by 
ensuring 
appropriate labour compliance covering 
its workers and monitoring compliance 
by its third party providers of contractual 
workforce. 
 Positive 
6.
Customer 
Centricity, 
Operational 
Excellence and 
Innovation
Opportunity
Customers 
across 
Nesco’s 
diverse 
businesses are a key area of focus for 
the client-facing and operational teams. 
Investments in innovative technologies 
drive 
improvement 
in 
customer 
experience while improving operational 
efficiency and effectiveness.
  Nesco is refining its systems and 
governance to maximise customer 
satisfaction 
across 
businesses. 
The 
Company invests in improving its 
sustainability performance while actively 
engaging with customers to identify 
and address issues, and maintaining 
operational agility to improve service 
levels. The use of new technologies 
(including digital) helps improve user 
experience across stakeholders while 
improving profitability.
 Positive
7.
Sustainable Supply 
Chain Management
Risk 
Disruptions, within the supply chain, 
can impact the Company’s operations. 
A lack of attention to ethical and 
sustainable sourcing practices can lead 
to non-adherence to LEED certification 
requirements, 
increasing 
specific-
supplier and overall supply chain risks.
Nesco has renewed its commitment 
to a sustainable supply chain to 
build operational resilience, achieve 
cost savings, and foster long-term 
relationships with suppliers. The individual 
businesses 
engage 
suppliers 
from 
marginalised/vulnerable 
communities 
wherever possible and localise the supply 
chain. The Company has rolled out a 
Supplier Code of Conduct which lays 
out its ESG, regulatory compliance and 
other expectations from its suppliers. 
The Company’s approach to Sustainable 
Sourcing is discussed in Principle 2.

#Nesco seeks to engage with public policy only through industry associations wherever applicable. However, the Company currently does not see the need 
for a dedicated policy on this matter, as Nesco’s viewpoints are expressed through various forums.
*The Board of Directors on the recommendation of the Leadership team including the Chairman & Managing Director reviews the Company’s policies 
every year. During this evaluation, the policy’s effective implementation is assessed, and any policy or procedure adjustments needed are identified. If any 
amendments are needed, these are made and shared with the Board for approval.
**The Company’s certifications on Quality, Health and Safety (IS) 9001, 14001, and 45001 are certified by URS India and Green Building status has been 
assessed by the certifying body Indian Green Buildings Council (“IGBC”).
***Nesco has identified the key policies for the Company from a compliance and materiality perspective. Independent assessment/evaluation for the working 
of specific aspects of policies and businesses is carried out periodically by certifying bodies as explained above. The Company will plan for an external 
assessment of the working of the policies in due course.

2.	
a.	
Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)
	
	
Yes – Sustainable Sourcing is an emerging priority for Nesco and it is in the process of defining its procedures. 
In FY 2023-24, the Company drafted a Supplier Code of Conduct to define and govern ESG practices for its vendors and 
suppliers. Nesco is in the process of rolling this out for formal acceptance from its suppliers. The Company currently has an 
initial definition which considers the following:
	
	
•	
All of the Company’s vendors are contractually obligated to meet all government regulations related to wages, 
health and safety and environmental compliance.
	
	
•	
IT Parks - All products sourced for civil construction and renovation adhere to LEED certification guidelines.
	
	
•	
Bombay Exhibition Center (BEC) – Any Capex would be driven by safety and energy efficiency criteria.
	
	
•	
Nesco Foods – Preference for marginalised/vulnerable groups where possible.
	
	
•	
Indabrator - Input materials and components are sourced from certified partners who are compliant with relevant 
standards that may apply to them from time to time.
	
b.	
If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?
	
	
Nesco will be defining and monitoring the % of products that are sourced sustainably moving forward.
3.	
Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling, and disposal at the end of life, 
for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste, and (d) other waste:
	
Nesco IT Parks, Bombay Exhibition Center, and Nesco Foods are service businesses and the reclamation at the end-of-life 
stage of products does not apply to the Company. The mechanisms that are used to manage and dispose of waste (including 
recycling and disposal) that are generated as part of its operations have been mentioned in Principle 6, Essential Indicator 10. 
At Indabrator, the Company produces machinery and abrasives which are B2B in nature and reclaiming is beyond its scope.
4.	
Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (“EPR”) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes/No). If yes, whether the 
waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (“EPR”) plan submitted to Pollution Control 
Boards? If not, provide steps taken to address the same:
	
No, EPR does not apply to any of Nesco businesses.

Accessibility of workplaces:
	
Are the premises/offices of the entity accessible to differently-abled employees and workers, as per the requirements 
of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016? If not, whether any steps are being taken by the entity in this regard:
	
Nesco remains committed to inclusivity and adherence to legal mandates concerning persons with disabilities ensuring 
accessibility for differently-abled individuals within its own offices and premises. Proactive measures have been instituted. 
Nesco’s facilities in Mumbai have the requisite infrastructure such as ramps, walkways, turnstiles, and elevators with braille-
friendly switches. Essential facilities such as washrooms, staircases, and pedestrian walkways have railings and support 
structures. A wheelchair is readily available in the lobby, with designated parking spaces provided for differently abled 
individuals. Additionally, a dedicated “P” gate streamlines access to respective floors.
	
Based on feedback from the Company’s occupiers’ community, Nesco has also created a dedicated drop-off point to facilitate 
ease of access for persons with disabilities. Nesco’s manufacturing plants and offices in Gujarat are all on the ground floor 
and accessible.
4.	
Does the entity have an equal opportunity policy as per the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016? If so, provide 
a web link to the policy:
	
The Human Capital Management Policy, approved by the Board, ensures equal opportunities at Nesco, both in recruitment and 
employment. Discrimination based on age, region, caste, creed, race, colour, gender, religion, national origin, social groupings, 
disability, or marital status is strictly prohibited, as per relevant local, state, and national laws. Employment and promotion 
decisions are merit-based, considering qualifications, experience, and demonstrated capacity for enhanced performance, 
aligning with the principle of equal opportunity.

directing them to relevant internal functions within stipulated timelines. An escalation 
mechanism ensures timely resolution. This system has been recently introduced and will 
be strengthened in the coming years.

What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by 
the entity?
	
Nesco’s Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) system, inclusive of safety and health, conducts periodic reviews and assessments, 
highlighting areas for improvement across its businesses. The Company has implemented a comprehensive training regimen 
and formulated hazard identification and risk assessment processes. To maintain a safe working environment, the Company 
employs robust systems for identifying and evaluating work-related hazards, including factors such as lighting, air quality, 
fumes, noise levels, and ease of movement throughout its facilities. These hazards are systematically assessed and prioritised 
based on significance, with mitigation strategies implemented as necessary. The Company’s internal documentation outlines 
its safety protocols while highlighting significant health and safety risks, ensuring that all stakeholders are well-informed and 
adequately trained on safety procedures and control measures. There is a process defined for employee, customer and visitor 
complaints related to safety that are reviewed and acted upon for redressal.
c.	
Whether you have processes for workers to report work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such risks: 
(Yes/No)
	
Yes, the Company has established processes for reporting and removal from work-related risks and hazards for all internal 
and external stakeholders. Communication protocols have been established to ensure rapid and efficient dissemination of 
information. A dedicated WhatsApp group enables immediate reporting of incidents, complemented by onsite maintenance 
of incident reports to document and mitigate work-related hazards. Regular training sessions and awareness programs are 
conducted for all stakeholders to facilitate hazard reporting and mitigation efforts. Furthermore, a comprehensive reporting and 
escalation system, accessible via WhatsApp, telephone, or email, allows for detailed incident reporting to senior management. 
These hazards are addressed based on the urgency, sensitivity, and impact of each situation.
	
At the Company’s Indabrator premises, a structured system is in place for employees to report work-related hazards and 
promptly remove themselves from such situations. Comprehensive training enables the workers to recognise potential dangers 
and utilise available communication channels within their workplaces, including suggestion boxes. These reports are promptly 
reviewed and addressed, with forms provided in the local regional language (Gujarati) and incentives are in place to encourage 
active participation from both permanent and contractual employees and workers.
	
Additionally, Nesco conducts semi-annual joint fire drills for all offices and staff at Nesco and Indabrator plants to educate the 
personnel on emergency preparedness and fire evacuation procedures.

12.	 Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy workplace:
	
Nesco remains committed to maintaining a safe and healthy workplace environment through proactive measures, 
comprehensive training, and continuous improvement initiatives. At Nesco’s business operations in Mumbai, safety and health 
measures are stringent, including clear signage and risk identification systems, to alert workers, employees, visitors, and 
occupiers’ employees about necessary precautions. The Company conducts weekly training sessions for housekeeping staff 
and monthly sessions for the engineering team, focusing on Occupational Health and Safety (“OH&S”). Additionally, Nesco’s 
facilities undergo rigorous monthly audits by third-party agencies, specifically targeting fire detection and suppression systems. 
Electrical infrastructure and elevators are audited annually by third-party professionals to ensure operational efficiency, safety, 
adherence to maintenance contracts and compliance with preventive measures. Nesco’s Total Facility Management (“TFM”) 
team participates in bi-annual Reward and Recognition programs, aligning with its commitment to safety as a part of business 
continuity planning.
	
Regular client engagement sessions provide awareness of infrastructure, health, safety, and recreation. Clients’ third-party 
audits on occupational health and safety are conducted regularly without any reported issues. Employees receive tailored 
training for maintenance and repair work. Critical tasks require hot and cold work permits and additionally, gas-based welding 
is prohibited. All relevant systems, including refrigerants, fire detection and suppression systems, as well as emergency 
response processes, are annually audited and are under maintenance contracts with appropriate vendors. Safety signages are 
prominently displayed in all plant rooms to deter unauthorised entry, while Standard Operating Procedures (“SOPs”) are visibly 
posted for operational clarity and safety.
	
There are ongoing inspections and restoration to ensure the safety and integrity of the entire hall ceiling structure in the BEC 
exhibition halls to maintain a secure environment. Structural enhancements encompass fabricated stairs and steps in plant 
rooms, and various civil works such as floor levelling, drainage, and exhaust systems with automation to ensure adequate 
ventilation in electrical panel rooms. There are periodic checks of structures like shades, nets, and shutters at Hall No. 7 gate.
	
The Company ensures a conducive work environment through measures such as adequate fresh air, CO2 sensors, lighting, and 
appropriate air conditioning. Green spaces and amenities like gyms and food courts promote well-being. Regular engagement 
activities are organised, and 24/7 ambulance service is available onsite.
	
In the Indabrator business, Personal Protective Equipment (“PPE”) is provided to mitigate hazards, alongside strict adherence to 
cleanliness protocols. Safety inspections and security checks are routine, ensuring a safe workplace environment.

Company’s Human Rights Policy outlines its commitment to preventing violations/abuse of human rights in all operations 
and dealings. It provides access to grievance redressal mechanisms for all individuals whose human rights may be impacted 
by Nesco’s operations. Further, it assesses and evaluates the impacts of human rights in operations and value chain activities

5.	
Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues:
	
Nesco has a mechanism in place to redress grievances related to human rights. They are addressed by the Internal Complaints 
Committee (“ICC”) according to the procedures outlined in the Prevention of Sexual Harassment at Workplace (“POSH”) 
Policy. Furthermore, unethical behaviour can be reported through the Whistle Blower Policy, which is overseen by the Audit 
Committee of the Board. Both these policies are communicated to all the employees and are available on the HRMS and website 
of the Company. Training was provided to employees on the procedure of redressal under the POSH and Whistle Blower Policy. 
The employees are encouraged to make suggestions and raise concerns regarding working conditions and safety, with a 
suggestion box available at the Company’s manufacturing location for grievance collection. Grievances of non-permanent 
employees are handled directly by the contractors who employ them; however, the Company co-operates and provides the 
necessary support, information, and documentation to the extent applicable for the smooth redressal of grievances.

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases:
	
Nesco maintains a comprehensive Prevention of Sexual Harassment (“POSH”) policy, ensuring protection for complainants 
against any form of retaliation. The Policy is accessible to all employees on the Company’s website and integrated into the 
HRMS. It safeguards individuals from adverse actions or mistreatment resulting from complaints, such as termination, 
demotion, or harassment. The Internal Complaints Committee (“ICC”) promptly addresses sexual harassment complaints. 
Comprising members dedicated to women’s rights and possessing expertise in legal matters, the ICC ensures confidentiality 
and protects complainants and witnesses from victimisation. Importantly, at least half of the committee members are women. 
During investigations, the ICC recommends interim relief measures, like workplace transfers or leave, to prevent further harm 
to the complainant.
	
The Policy strictly prohibits reprisals against complainants, with disciplinary action for violators, showcasing the Company’s 
commitment to safeguarding all employees’ rights and well-being. Additionally, provisions within the Policy allow for support to 
be provided to complainants during the investigation and resolution process, which may include counselling services, granting 
leave of absence, or implementing temporary arrangements to ensure a safe working environment for all parties involved.
	
The policy can be accessed at https://www.nesco.in/resources/images/pdf/policy/policy-on-sexual-harrassment-at-workplace.

10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by 
your Company to reduce the usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices 
adopted to manage such wastes:
	
The Company has identified waste management as a material ESG topic and has formulated strategies to focus on recycling 
and reducing waste generated. As discussed in Section A, Question 26, the scope of waste management for IT Parks and the 
Restaurant businesses is impacted by stakeholders beyond the Company’s control. Nesco carries out awareness drives including 
regular communication with all its clients to segregate the dry and wet waste for disposal in the garbage area. Waste generated 
at Nesco IT Park is segregated and stored in wet and dry bins. Dry waste is collected by authorised vendors and recycled. Food 
waste generated at Nesco Foods is stored in a refrigerated garbage room. Wet waste (food and other bio-degradable waste) 
is partially converted to manure in the Organic Waste Composting machines. This manure and the sludge from the Sewage 
Treatment Plants (“STP”) are used for gardening wherever appropriate, the food services from Nesco Foods use eco-ware and 
paper products that are bio-degradable. The empty containers are collected in dedicated bins and disposed of through the 
proper Garbage Clearance Mechanism of the BMC. Similarly, plastic waste, generated primarily from water bottles, is collected 
by a BMC-empaneled vendor. E-waste and hazardous waste are collected, processed, and disposed of through an authorised 
recycling, handling and disposal agency.
	
For events and exhibitions, waste management is handled by the organisers and is overseen by Nesco personnel. At Indabrator, 
plastic waste, hazardous waste, and E-waste are disposed of through government-approved, registered recyclers and handlers. 
In the case of other waste materials such as wood and cardboard, approximately 50% are reused or repurposed, aligning with 
the Company’s commitment to sustainable waste management practices.
