1.
Sustainable 
Finance
O
Financing has an 
important role to play in 
enabling businesses and 
economies to transition to 
a sustainable economy.
The MSME sector in India 
is one of the key drivers 
of the economy and 
significantly contributes 
to the country’s GDP as 
well as employment. 
As a financial services 
company, we recognize 
that directing capital 
towards such enterprises 
presents a substantial 
opportunity for us to make 
a meaningful impact. 
We firmly believe that 
achieving financial success 
should be intricately linked 
with our contribution to the 
greater good of society. 
Being an NBFC, focusing on 
providing loans to businesses and 
individuals in the MSME sector 
that are underserved, we are 
addressing a major financing gap, 
thus, enabling such businesses 
and entrepreneurs to obtain loans 
to scale up their operations, 
improve efficiency or for other 
business expansion-related 
purposes. 
Our efforts involve placing a 
heightened focus on providing 
loans to entrepreneurs and 
small businesses with a focus 
on sustainability and inclusive 
growth. 
Attracting Impact Investors 
(Positive): Sustainable 
finance initiatives often 
attract impact investors 
and institutions focused on 
impactful investments. By 
aligning with sustainability 
goals, we may gain access 
to a new source of funding 
and partnerships with 
organizations that are keen 
on supporting socially 
responsible initiatives.
Risk Mitigation (Positive): 
Assessing and promoting 
sustainability in lending 
can help identify risks 
and opportunities more 
effectively. It can lead to 
better risk management by 
avoiding high-risk industries 
or projects, reducing the 
likelihood of loan defaults 
and losses.
Improved Reputation 
(Positive): Incorporating 
sustainability into your 
business model can enhance 
your brand image and 
reputation. Customers, 
especially those from 
younger generations, are 
increasingly choosing 
businesses that align with 
their values, including 
environmental and social 
responsibility.

Climate 
Change 
and GHG 
Emissions
R
We recognize that climate 
change poses a risk to 
our operations, our clients 
and the broader economy. 
The increasing levels of 
greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions contribute to 
global warming, resulting 
in more frequent and 
severe climate-related 
events such as hurricanes, 
floods, droughts and 
heatwaves. These events 
can potentially disrupt 
businesses, communities, 
and the availability 
of natural resources, 
impacting our operations 
and portfolio. Additionally, 
regulatory changes aimed 
at mitigating climate 
change, such as carbon 
pricing and emissions 
reduction targets, may 
affect our loan portfolio.
We are committed to addressing 
climate change risks through 
proactive measures. We are also 
working on proactively reporting 
on environmental data to assess 
our environmental impact and 
formulate strategies to mitigate 
emissions. 
Financial Implications 
(Negative): We acknowledge 
that climate change-related 
risks may have adverse 
financial implications for 
SBFC Finance Limited. These 
risks include the potential 
for increased loan defaults, 
reduced asset values and 
losses on investments in 
sectors vulnerable to climate 
impacts such as fossil fuels 
and agriculture. Furthermore, 
extreme weather events 
can disrupt our business 
operations, leading to 
financial losses for us and 
our clients.

Financial 
Inclusion 
and Capacity 
Building
O
MSMEs contribute 
significantly to India's 
growth story by making 
up a substantial portion 
of the country's GDP as 
well as employment. 
However, they do not 
have required access to 
formal credit or lending. 
As a result, financing 
becomes a major obstacle 
for such entrepreneurs 
and business owners as 
traditional banks do not 
provide financing tailored 
to their requirements. 
At SBFC, we aim to fill 
this gap by providing 
financing opportunities 
to underserved business 
owners and further 
unlocking India's growth 
story. We are also deeply 
associated with uplifting 
other marginalized groups 
of society, including 
women, rural and local 
borrowers, people in old 
age, etc., ensuring overall 
inclusion.
As an NBFC engaged in providing 
loans to small businesses and 
entrepreneurs in the MSME sector, 
women, and other marginalized 
groups, our business model 
aligns with key principles of 
financial inclusion. Some of our 
current approaches to capture the 
opportunity include:
1.  Partnerships: Collaborating with 
government agencies, non-
governmental organizations 
and other stakeholders to 
effectively promote financial 
inclusion and address 
challenges. We can leverage 
expertise, resources, and 
networks through partnerships 
to scale our impact.
2.  Data and Analytics: Leveraging 
data and analytics to identify 
regions and communities 
with limited financial services 
access. This data-driven 
approach will enable us to 
prioritize our efforts and 
allocate resources where they 
are most needed. 
3.  Ethical Selling and Responsible 
Marketing: Ensuring the 
highest quality of ethics during 
the sale of our products. Our 
training programs ensure 
that all the product-related 
terms and conditions are 
appropriately explained to 
the customer during the loan 
process. In case of grievances 
or complaints, the customer 
can raise their grievance with 
us through multiple channels at 
their disposal.
Embracing financial 
inclusion and climate change 
as an opportunity can lead 
to several positive financial 
implications: 
 
1.  Market Expansion: 
Reaching previously 
underserved markets 
can expand our customer 
base and unlock new 
business opportunities.
2   Customer Loyalty and 
Retention: Providing 
tailored financial solutions 
can foster customer 
loyalty and retention, 
enhancing long-term 
profitability.
3.  Reputation and Branding: 
Demonstrating our 
commitment to financial 
inclusion aligns with 
evolving consumer 
preferences and 
enhances our reputation 
as a socially responsible 
financial institution, 
attracting ethically 
minded customers and 
investors.

Well-being
O
At SBFC, we recognize that 
our employees' health and 
well-being are paramount 
to our organisation's

Emphasizing employee 
health and well-being 
presents a significant 
opportunity to create a 
positive and productive 
work environment while 
fostering a culture of care 
and support.
To prioritize employee health and 
well-being, we have developed 
a comprehensive approach that 
demonstrates our commitment 
to our most valuable asset - our 
employees: 
 
1.  Health Benefits and Insurance: 
Providing robust health benefits 
and insurance coverage to 
ensure our employees have 
access to quality medical care 
and support in times of need.

rigorous safety standards and 
promoting a culture of safety 
awareness among employees.
3.  Flexible Work Arrangements:

arrangements, such as remote 
work options or flexible 
hours, to accommodate our 
employees' diverse needs and 
responsibilities.
Financial Implications 
(Positive): Prioritizing 
employee health and 
well-being can lead to 
several positive financial 
implications: 
 
1.  Increased Productivity: 
Healthy and engaged 
employees tend to 
be more productive, 
improving operational 
efficiency and enhanced 
customer service.
2.  Reduced Absenteeism 
and Turnover: By 
investing in employee 
well-being, we can 
potentially reduce 
absenteeism and 
turnover, leading to cost 
savings associated with 
recruitment and training.
3.  Enhanced Employee 
Engagement: Focusing 
on health and well-being 
fosters a positive work 
culture, leading to higher 
employee satisfaction 
and increased 
organisational loyalty.
4.  Attracting Talent: 
Demonstrating our 
commitment to employee 
health and well-being 
makes us an attractive 
employer, helping us 
attract and retain top 
talent in the industry.

Customer 
Experience
O
Customer experience is 
a significant opportunity 
to enhance our 
competitiveness and build 
lasting relationships with 
our clients. By delivering 
exceptional services and 
products, we can increase 
customer satisfaction, 
retention and loyalty.
To maximize the opportunity of 
customer experience, we have 
adopted the following approach: 
1.  Digital Innovation: Embracing 
digitalization and leveraging 
innovative technologies 
through our “PhyGital” model, 
which uses technology and 
authentic in-person service 
to create loans that support 
our customers' ambitions. We 
engage directly with small 
business owners and work 
through loan applications 
together, in person, at the 
customer’s pace.
2.  Grievance Redressal 
Mechanisms: We have a 
dedicated grievance redressal 
mechanism to promptly 
address customer-related 
complaints and grievances 
through multiple channels. 
Each complaint is thoroughly 
reviewed, monitored and 
resolved to achieve customer 
satisfaction. To bolster our 
support, a dedicated Grievance 
Redressal Officer is appointed 
and prominently displayed in 
all our branches. 
3.  Continuous Improvement: 
Continuously reviewing and 
upgrading our processes and 
systems to stay ahead in the 
dynamic financial landscape 
and provide the best possible 
experience to our customers.
Financial Implications 
(Positive): Improving 
customer experience can 
lead to several positive 
financial implications such 
as:
1.  Customer Loyalty: 
Satisfied customers are 
more likely to remain 
loyal and utilize a broader 
range of our services, 
increasing customer 
retention and lifetime 
value.
2.  Word-of-Mouth Referrals: 
Delighted customers are 
more inclined to refer 
friends and family to our 
services, expanding our 
customer base through 
word-of-mouth referrals.
3.  Competitive Advantage: 
By providing superior 
customer experience, 
we can differentiate 
ourselves from 
competitors and attract 
new customers seeking 
exceptional financial 
services.

Data privacy 
and Cyber 
security
R
Data privacy and 
cybersecurity is a 
significant risk for us due 
to data breaches' potential 
financial and reputational 
consequences. In the 
event of a security breach, 
sensitive customer 
information could be 
exposed, leading to 
regulatory fines, legal 
liabilities, loss of customer 
trust and damage to the 
company's brand image. 
Ensuring robust data 
protection measures is 
essential to safeguard 
the institution's and its 
customers' interests.
We have a well-defined 
framework and policy on cyber 
security and data privacy. This 
policy assures users that all 
personal information provided 
through the website is treated 
with the utmost confidentiality and 
is not shared with third parties 
in most circumstances, unless 
explicitly solicited and permitted 
by the user.
In alignment with our commitment 
to providing safe and secure 
banking services, we have a 
defined cyber security and data 
privacy policy for client data 
protection. Our Phygital Model 
blends technology with human 
touch, effectively allowing us to 
understand and underwrite credit 
for our valued customers.
Financial Implications 
(Negative): Data privacy and 
cybersecurity risks can have 
several adverse financial 
implications for us at SBFC. 
Some of these implications 
include, but are not limited 
to:
1.  Reputation Damage: 
A data breach or 
cybersecurity incident 
can severely impact our 
reputation, leading to a 
loss of customer trust 
and potential business 
opportunities.
2.  Financial Losses: 
Cyberattacks may result 
in financial losses, such 
as regulatory fines, legal 
costs, and compensating 
affected customers for 
any damages incurred.

Economic 
Performance
O
For SBFC, strong economic 
performance opens doors 
to greater access to 
funding sources, enabling 
them to expand their 
lending capabilities and 
reach a wider customer 
base. It enhances the 
organization's ability to 
offer competitive interest 
rates and attractive 
financial products, 
attracting potential 
borrowers and investors. 
Additionally, a solid 
financial track record 
builds trust and credibility 
in the eyes of regulatory 
authorities and customers, 
fostering long-term 
relationships and ensuring 
sustained profitability for 
the organization.
To leverage the opportunity of 
economic performance, we have 
developed the following approach:
1. Financial Strength: We have the 
capital to grow confidently and 
are backed by investors.
2. Skilled workforce: We have a 
hand-picked team of people 
with diverse skills, relevant 
experience and a passion for 
customer service.
3. Risk Management:  We have 
implemented effective risk 
management practices to 
identify and mitigate potential 
financial risks that could impact 
our economic performance.
4. Analytics: We optimize business 
processes and customer service 
using advanced data analysis.
5. Innovation and Technology: 
We use smart technology to 
enhance efficiency and simplify 
customer journeys.
6. Responsible Investments: 
Making responsible and 
sustainable investments 
that align with our values 
and contribute to long-term 
economic growth.
Financial Implications 
(Positive): Maintaining strong 
economic performance 
can lead to several positive 
financial implications for 
us. Some of these key 
implications include:
1.  Investor Confidence: 
A strong financial 
performance can 
enhance investor 
confidence and attract 
new investors seeking 
profitable opportunities.
2. Competitive Advantage: 
A robust economic 
performance positions 
us favourably among 
competitors and 
strengthens our position in 
the financial market.
3. Capital Access: Improved 
economic performance 
enhances our ability 
to access capital for 
expansion and strategic 
investments.

Business 
Ethics and 
Governance
O
At SBFC, we recognize that 
having strong business 
ethics and governance 
presents significant 
opportunities for us 
to establish ourselves 
as responsible and 
trustworthy organizations 
in the financial industry. 
This is particularly crucial 
considering the inherent 
risks associated with the 
financial sector and the 
need to safeguard the 
interests of customers, 
investors and stakeholders.
By adhering to strong ethical 
practices and adopting robust 
governance mechanisms, we seek 
to enhance our reputation in the 
market. Trust is a vital asset in the 
financial sector and customers 
are more likely to engage with 
an organization that prioritizes 
ethics and governance. We have 
a strong Code of Conduct at 
place along with other policies to 
ensure that ethical practices are 
upheld at all times and throughout 
the hierarchy of our operational 
system. 
Financial Implications 
(Positive):
Ethical behaviour improves 
the reputation of the 
company, attracting more 
customers, thereby 
increasing revenue. It may 
also help to attract more 
investments and capital. 
Compliance with ethical 
standards reduces legal and 
regulatory expenses and 
also facilitate easier access 
to capital markets for further 
growth. 
10.
Risk 
Management
O
Risk Management 
presents a significant 
opportunity for SBFC since 
it helps us to enhance our 
stability, resilience and 
sustainable growth. As we 
operate in an inherently 
risk-prone financial 
environment, effective risk 
management strategies 
help us minimize 
our losses, maintain 
regulatory compliance 
and enhance investor 
confidence which in turn 
helps us in optimizing our 
capital allocations, thus 
maximizing returns on 
investments. 
We have a highly comprehensive 
risk management strategy that 
helps us to navigate uncertainties 
and achieve long term success in 
our business. 
We have identified potential 
sources of risks specific to our 
business model, operations and 
industry and accordingly we 
have implemented risk mitigation 
strategies and controls to reduce 
the likelihood and impact of the 
identified risks. 
We have also established a robust 
system to continuously monitor 
risks and ensure the proper 
approach towards mitigation of 
the risks. 
Financial Implications 
(Positive):
1.  A comprehensive risk 
management strategy 
will positively impact our 
financial performance 
by reducing losses, 
enhancing profitability, 
optimizing capital 
allocation, improving 
creditworthiness, 
ensuring compliance, 
attracting investments 
and fostering customer 
trust. 
2.  Proactive management 
of risks reduces the 
likelihood and severity 
of financial losses 
and avoid potential 
expenses associated with 
managing and recovering 
from risk related 
incidents. 
3.  It positions the company 
as a stable and reliable 
financial institution, 
supporting sustainable 
growth and success in 
the competitive financial 
industry.

8.	 Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases. 
	
All employees have access to a grievance mechanism, which ensures that they can report and address their concerns 
confidentially and anonymously without facing any reprisals or adverse consequences. Employees are required to 
cooperate fully with any investigation into alleged violations of the Code of Conduct, Laws, Regulations, Policies, or 
Procedures. During such investigations, employees are expected to provide truthful and comprehensive information. All 
investigations conducted by SBFC are treated as confidential matters. Employees are prohibited from discussing any 
aspect of an investigation, including its existence, with anyone except members of the disciplinary action committees 
authorized under the policy guidelines. Moreover, the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC), as mandated by the Prevention 
of Sexual Harassment (POSH) Act, is applicable to all companes, to ensure a secure and inclusive work environment.

Initiative undertaken 
Details of the initiative (Web-link, if any,

The outcome of 
the initiative 
1.  In strict adherence to the guidelines laid out by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), lending companies are mandated to furnish welcome kits 
to their borrowers. To align with these directives and bolster sustainable practices, SBFC has transitioned to delivering digital welcome kits 
to all borrowers. This strategic shift has yielded twofold benefits. Firstly, it has substantially curtailed direct paper consumption, leading to a 
reduction in our ecological footprint. Secondly, by circumventing the need for physical transit, the initiative has tangibly minimized indirect 
fuel consumption, contributing to a more environmentally conscious operation.
2.  All loan documentation files stored in our warehouses were meticulously digitized and are now accessible in electronic format. This 
transformation has notably diminished the need for physical transportation of files across various locations, thus significantly decreasing 
indirect fuel consumption. Formerly, these files necessitated transport for verification, audit, and inspection purposes. As a result of this 
forward-looking endeavour, we have not only streamlined our operational processes but also achieved a substantial reduction in our carbon 
emissions footprint.

marginalized/vulnerable group
	
Being a NBFC, our service offerings include financial products and services to a wide range of consumers. Since such 
activities neither involve the procurement of raw materials nor the production of tangible goods, the procurement activities 
associated with our operations remain low and of limited scope. However, we are committed to upholding and promoting 
sustainability throughout our value chain, including the materials we procure for our day-to-day functioning, including 
administrative needs at offices and branches. Consequently, we are developing a Value Chain Policy that reflects our 
commitment to incorporate sustainable practices and develop a holistic approach to address ESG risks across our value 
chain. We ensure that the limited procurement activities that we conduct are conducted in a manner that aligns with our
