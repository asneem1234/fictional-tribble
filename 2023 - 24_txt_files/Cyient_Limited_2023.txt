1
Renewable 
Energy
Opportunity
Embracing renewable energy forms 
like solar and wind power can reduce 
reliance on non-renewable sources such 
as fossil fuels, leading to cost reductions 
and a more reliable energy supply. 
Renewable energy plays a crucial role in 
substantially lowering our emissions, 
ultimately leading to a decrease in costs.
-

2
Sustainable 
Supply Chain
Risk
Cyient’s supply chain faces potential 
risks from various factors. Suppliers 
not following sustainable practices 
could directly impact Cyient’s Scope 
3 emissions. Moreover, any regulatory 
non-compliance by Cyient’s suppliers 
could adversely affect the Company’s 
operations and reputation.
Our Vendor 
Code of Conduct 
(VCoC) and the 
Sustainable Supplier 
Assessment 
Framework assist 
us in reducing 
supply chain risks. 
Regular “Vendor 
Meets” help us to 
ensure our partners 
are in line with 
our sustainability 
objectives.

Inclusion and 
Diversity
Opportunity
Diversity and inclusion in workforce 
allows Cyient to tap into a variety of 
viewpoints, experiences, and concepts, 
propelling innovation, problem 
resolution, and decision-making. 
Practices that promote inclusion 
cultivate a nurturing atmosphere, 
boosting employee involvement, 
efficiency, and retention. 
Furthermore, a workplace that values 
diversity and inclusion enhances 
company’s reputation, draws high-
caliber talent, broadens our customer 
reach, and drives the growth and 
success of our business.

Business 
Ethics
Risk
Engaging in unethical business activities 
can result in legal and regulatory 
consequences, such as penalties and 
conflicts, threatening our financial 
security and tarnishing our image. 
Furthermore, these actions can erode 
the confidence of stakeholders, leading 
to a decline in sales, market dominance, 
and ultimately, a tarnished reputation.
The Corporate 
Governance Manual 
acts as a guide 
for the Board, 
management, and

factors to generate 
enduring value for all

by 
director

highlighting ESG related challenges, 
targets, and achievements (listed entity 
has flexibility regarding the placement of 
this disclosure) 
Embracing our role in fostering a sustainable future, we strategically revisited 
our sustainability goals this year, establishing short, medium, and long-term 
time-bound targets. In alignment with these objectives, we have undertaken 
several initiatives poised to propel us toward achieving our targets 
and collaboratively designing a sustainable tomorrow. Our unwavering 
commitment to being accountable, equitable, and responsible ensures that 
the well-being of our associates, clients, shareholders, and communities 
remains a cornerstone of our business strategy.
In our pursuit of operational excellence, we have conducted a TCFD climate 
risk assessment to better understand and mitigate environmental impacts 
within our own operations. Externally, we h delved into opportunities in 
carbon capture technologies, showcasing our commitment to tackling 
environmental challenges as part of our broader business objectives.
In FY24, we prioritized reducing energy consumption and increasing our use 
of renewable energy sources, aligning with our commitment to clean energy. 
We also focused on targeted waste reduction, recycling, and reuse programs, 
significantly minimizing our environmental impact.
Community empowerment remains integral to our mission. We continue to 
invest in education, upskilling, healthcare, and environmental protection 
initiatives. Through partnerships with local organizations, we promoted 
education and skill development among underprivileged communities while 
improving access to healthcare and fostering environmental sustainability. 
Cyient’s efforts were recognized with awards at the Indian Social Impact 
Awards 2024, reaffirming our commitment to responsible corporate 
citizenship.
Amidst our social and governance endeavors, we celebrated our 
remarkable milestones in innovation. The CyientifIQ Experience Center 
(CEC) inauguration showcased our commitment to tech advancement, 
featuring 100+ engineering solutions and fostering innovation. Initiatives 
like the CyientifIQ Global Innovation Hackathon promoted cross-border

45001:2018 certified.
b.	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine 
basis by the entity?
	
Cyient employs the Aspect Impact, Hazard Identification, and Risk Assessment (AIHIRA) Process to detect potential 
hazards and risks, ensuring compliance with relevant environmental standards and other regulatory requirements. 
This process evaluates potential environmental risks and their potential effects on our operations, and outlines 
steps to avert or lessen them. It also incorporates methods for assessing the success of our initiatives in alignment 
with our organizational goals.
c.	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from 
such risks.
	
Yes, we have enhanced the incident management process and the online EHS incident reporting tool to fortify 
the system and simplify reporting. The fire and safety teams are instantly alerted about any incidents. Those 
who report the incidents are emailed at the beginning of the investigation and are consistently informed about 
the actions taken. The process is considered complete once the relevant individuals have been notified of the 
outcome.
d.	
Do the employees/ workers of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services?
	
We conduct complimentary health screenings for our associates to ensure their optimal health and mental 
well-being, enabling them to deliver their finest work for Cyient and our stakeholders. We require our vendors 
to implement similar practices in their operations to maintain a secure and healthy supply chain with minimal 
interruptions. We have upgraded our transportation and security mechanisms to offer extra safeguards to our 
associates during their work travel.

At Cyient, we place a high value on engaging with stakeholders on matters related to economics, environment, 
and society to ensure a holistic approach to our Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) framework. We 
conduct thorough discussions with the Cyient board and management to pinpoint our key internal and external 
stakeholders, encompassing Investors, Employees, Clients, Senior Management, Leadership, Community, and 
Suppliers. This inclusive strategy allows us to collect essential insights and feedback from our stakeholders. These 
contributions are incorporated into our decision-making processes, enabling us to align our business objectives 
with the vital needs of our stakeholders and the wider community. This information is a critical component for 
informed decision-making, facilitating our ability to manage economic, environmental, and social considerations 
responsibly and sustainably.

Yes, to support the identification and management of material topics related to environment and social, we utilize 
stakeholder consultation in a 5-step process:
1.	
Universe of Issues: We compiled a comprehensive list of environmental, economic, and social issues in line 
with industry specific ESG standards.
2.	
Business Objectives: We scrutinized wide-ranging issues pertinent to revenue targets, business sustainability, 
operational costs, brand value, and overarching business objectives.
3.	
Risk Assessment: We assessed the universe of issues considering inherent and external risks, ranking them 
based on their potential business impact and our readiness to tackle them.
4.	
Stakeholder Engagement: We solicited views from internal and external stakeholders on the importance of 
identified issues and gauged stakeholder responses against their impact on our business.
5.	
External Benchmarks: We compared the identified issues with other reporting frameworks, such as UN SDGs, 
National Voluntary Guidelines (NVGs), and the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. 
	
Our sustainability initiatives target the most relevant concerns identified through this strategic approach, 
assisting us in accomplishing our sustainability objectives and enhancing our comprehension of our 
stakeholders’ needs.

Helpline for whistleblowing. The policy ensures associates can confidentially raise concerns, which are then 
investigated and resolved fairly, with a guarantee of no retaliation. The Integrity Helpline provides a channel for 
both employees and external stakeholders to submit complaints, allowing the external agency to conduct impartial 
investigations, thereby promoting fairness and adherence to regulations. These procedures guarantee prompt 
and efficient grievance resolution, fostering a work environment that is both respectful and secure. Additionally, 
in compliance with the “Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 
2013,” there is a dedicated internal committee to handle complaints related to sexual harassment.

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases.
	
We are committed to creating a workplace where associates can work free from discrimination, gender bias, or 
sexual harassment. Cyient has non-retaliation clause in its Disciplinary action policy which says, “Cyient recognizes 
that reporting any misconduct, including violations of the Cyient Code of Ethics & Business Conduct can be 
stressful to the employee who is reporting any misconduct. Therefore, Cyient strictly prohibits retaliation against 
anyone who makes a good faith report about a known or suspected policy / code of conduct violation / Human 
rights violation and against anyone who assists in an investigation into such matters.” Also, as per Cyient Whistle-
blower Policy & Procedures, a complainant has the right to protection from retaliation of any form. Management 
has formed a committee to investigate such complaints. The Chairman and Managing Director have the authority 
to set up the required committees at each company site to meet the obligations of the Act.

10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted 
by your Company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the 
practices adopted to manage such wastes.
	
We prioritize responsible waste management to reduce our environmental impact. We have a system in place that uses 
different bins to sort waste into categories like recyclables, organic matter, and non-recyclables, and we ensure proper 
disposal through vendors approved by the Pollution Control Board. For paper waste, we collaborate with certified 
vendors and use recycled paper for our notepads. We manage food and garden waste with organic waste converters 
on-site, which turn this waste into compost for our gardens. We advise our employees to avoid using hazardous or 
non-biodegradable items and regularly send reminders to reinforce this practice.
	
We also treat the wastewater produced at our facilities through a Sewage Treatment Plant (STP). Cyient is dedicated 
to minimizing the use of toxic chemicals, including those used in STP operations and cleaning routines. We employ 
dilution techniques to lower chemical concentrations, enhancing safety during handling. All chemicals utilized within 
our organization are certified by authorized agencies, affirming their quality and regulatory compliance.

Outcome of the initiative
1.
Use of 
renewable 
energy
We have taken significant strides by enhancing the 
use of renewable energy within our organization. 
Our offices located in Bangalore, Manikonda, 
Madhapur, Kakinada, Vizag, and Warangal are at the 
forefront of this initiative, operating with a growing 
reliance on clean and sustainable energy sources
Our strategic adoption of renewable 
energy sources has resulted in a 
significant reduction of our carbon 
emissions, exemplifying our dedication 
to environmental sustainability. 
Concurrently, it has also reduced our 
operational expenditures.
2.
Installation of 
EV charging 
stations
In line with our commitment to environmental 
sustainability and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions, we have installed electric vehicle (EV) 
charging stations for both two-wheelers and 
four-wheelers at our Manikonda, Madhapur, and 
Bangalore facilities. These initiatives are a clear 
reflection of our commitment to fostering the 
transition to cleaner modes of transportation within 
our organization
To promote the use of electric vehicles, 
thereby decreasing the emissions 
resulting from our associates 
commute.
3.
Recycling of 
wastewater
We have taken a significant step towards 
environmental conservation by implementing 
in-house Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) at our 
Manikonda, Madhapur, Bangalore, Kakinada, and 
Warangal facilities.
This initiative allows us to recycle 
wastewater effectively, reducing 
our water footprint and promoting 
sustainable water management.
4.
Waste 
Management
By installing Organic Waste Converters (OWC) at 
our offices in Manikonda, Madhapur, and Bangalore, 
we convert the food waste produced into compost. 
This compost is subsequently utilized as a natural 
fertilizer in our gardens. We also avoid procurement 
and use of single use plastics across our offices.
This has led to a decrease in waste sent 
to landfills and has fostered a culture of 
sustainability within the organization by 
repurposing organic waste and curbing 
the reliance on environmentally harmful 
single-use plastics.
