The Ethics & Compliance Helpline directs grievances to relevant ethics and compliance personnel for evaluation and 
investigation. In cases where required, independent external entities are called upon to investigate the complaints. 
The company preserves confidentiality by not requiring the identity to be revealed when filing a complaint. Following 
a complaint, the complainant is given a unique case reference number that can be used to verify the progress of the 
complaint after 45 days. If the complainant experiences retaliation or victimization after reporting an incident, they may 
seek help from the Ethics Committee.

1
Product 
Stewardship
R/O
Risk: Incidents of 
poor product quality 
and counterfeit items 
increase the likelihood 
of product recalls, 
endangering brand 
reputation, safety, 
and consumer trust.
Opportunities: As 
consumer preferences 
shift towards 
more sustainable 
choices, there is a 
growing interest 
in understanding 
the environmental 
impacts of products 
throughout their 
lifecycle, including 
the materials used 
for packaging and 
the resulting waste 
generated.
TCPL has implemented a 
robust quality assurance 
program, stringent 
supplier norms for raw 
material safety, and 
residue testing across all 
regions.  
We have measurable 
‘healthy nutrition’ 
criteria defined for our 
product innovations. 
Additionally, we are 
focused on developing 
sustainable packaging 
solutions. 
The company has 
developed a vast and 
expansive network of 
distributors and retailers 
who help serve the 
needs  of millions of 
consumers on a daily 
basis. This has   helped 
us increase our market 
presence in semi-urban 
and rural areas and has 
also effectively helped 
us tackle the issue of 
counterfeit products.
Positive:
Leveraging 
technology can 
improve product 
safety and quality, 
effectively managing 
counterfeit products 
and enhancing 
product stewardship. 
There is also a trend 
of increasing demand 
for healthy and 
nutritious products 
which the company is 
in a position to meet.

Access to 
nutrition
O
Opportunity: Access 
to the right healthy 
products plays 
a crucial role in 
addressing issues 
of malnutrition and 
promoting proper 
nutrition.
Positive: Our products 
are consumed 
by a wide range 
of consumers on 
an almost daily 
basis, providing an 
opportunity for our 
products to act as a 
medium for delivering 
healthy nutrition and 
provide enormous 
potential to positively 
impact the lives 
of millions of our 
consumers.  
There is a growing 
consumer preference 
for products that 
are healthy and 
nutritious, signalling 
an opportunity for 
top-line growth. We 
are actively pursuing 
organic and inorganic 
growth avenues 
that can support our 
consumers’ nutritional 
aspirations

Consumer 
Connect
R/O
Risk: The 
performance of our 
products hinges on 
our agility in adapting 
to evolving consumer 
preferences and 
market trends.
Opportunity: There 
has been a significant 
shift in global 
consumer behaviour 
towards health-
focused products 
and  trusted brands. 
TCPL is strategically 
positioning itself 
to capitalize on 
these emerging 
opportunities.
We track consumer 
trends, accelerating 
innovation through 
a dedicated funnel 
and multiple brand 
launches/extensions. 
Technology aids project 
tracking, supported by a 
defined NPD stage gate 
mechanism.
TCPL has ‘For Better’ 
Claims Guidelines 
tailored to meet 
consumer needs, 
encompassing a wide 
range of claims, from 
sensory appeal to 
ingredient-specific 
assertions.
Positive: Our utmost 
priority lies in 
consumer satisfaction 
and well-being. By 
developing products 
with this focus, we 
anticipate an increase 
in brand loyalty.
4
Water 
security
R
Risk:  Water security 
is identified as a 
risk due to potential 
business continuity 
issues and the 
likelihood of increased 
water shortages in 
the future
Our water risk mitigation 
strategy includes 
runoff and rainwater 
harvesting, ZLD at 
plants, eco-pulpers 
for water reduction, 
and R&D for water-
resistant plants. We 
conduct thorough water 
risk assessments to 
ensure operational 
sustainability and 
resilience. A detailed 
source water 
vulnerability assessment 
has been conducted 
for some business 
segments. Please refer 
the ‘For Better Planet’ 
section of this report.
Negative: Significant 
investments may 
be required to 
execute our water 
risk mitigation 
strategies, including 
infrastructure 
upgrades and 
technology 
implementation.

Statement by director responsible 
for the business responsibility 
report, highlighting ESG 
related challenges, targets, and 
achievements (listed entity has 
flexibility regarding the 
placement of this disclosure)
As we continue our pursuit of sustainability, Tata Consumer Products Ltd (TCPL) 
has achieved notable advancements in our ESG strategy. This year assumes 
greater significance due to the de-merger of Tata Coffee and formation of 
a separate plantation organization as well as the integration of soluble and 
extraction operations into the Tata Consumer Products Limited. This strategic 
integration strengthens our position as a global leader in the FMCG sector 
under the Tata Group.
Guided by four pillars - #ForBetter Sourcing, #ForBetter Planet, #ForBetter 
Communities, and #ForBetter Nutrition, our #ForBetterLiving ESG strategy 
underscores our commitment to responsible business practices. At the core 
of our ESG strategy lies our proactive approach to addressing a variety of 
risks including climate change as per the Task Force on Climate-related 
Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and adopting a robust climate risk assessment 
framework, we effectively identify and mitigate both physical and transition 
risks. Our journey towards water neutrality involves comprehensive water 
risk assessments aligned with the Climate Disclosure Standards Board’s 
(CDSB) framework recommendations. Our dedication extends to fostering a 
safe, inclusive, and rewarding work environment for our employees. Through 
collaboration with government and regulatory bodies, we drive positive change 
within our communities, promoting resilience and empowerment. Our robust 
policies in nutrition, green procurement, energy conservation, environmental 
impact, and marketing ensure transparency, accountability, and sustainability 
across all business segments. Responding to evolving consumer and investor 
expectations, we consistently deliver products that not only meet consumer 
needs but also provide accurate nutrition information to facilitate informed 
choices. Upholding investor trust, we maintain the highest standards of 
transparency and governance excellence.
In conclusion, our progress in advancing our ESG strategy underscores our 
dedication to creating enduring value for all stakeholders, driving positive 
social and environmental impact. We remain steadfast in our commitment to 
sustainability, contributing towards #ForBetter future for generations to come.

non-hazardous materials. Our waste disposal procedures are meticulously designed to comply with state regulations, and 
we partner with authorized recyclers identified by the State Pollution Control Boards to ensure proper disposal of hazardous 
wastes. We place significant emphasis on reclaiming packaging materials after consumer use. We collaborate with designated 
waste recyclers to aid us in gathering, reprocessing, and disposing of waste substances. We have adhered to the Extended 
Producer Responsibility (EPR) mandated to us with 100% compliance to the requirements in the reporting year.

achieved zero waste to landfill status, ensuring that all waste is responsibly disposed of through authorized vendors who 
recycle or repurpose it, effectively preventing it from ending up in landfills. In line with India's Plastic Waste Management 
Rules, our EPR Plan ensures the collection and recycling of the equivalent of 100% of post-consumer plastic waste, as 
mandated by the Central Pollution Control Board.

Yes/No (If Yes, then give details of the mechanism in brief)
Permanent Employees
We have established a robust system to promptly and efficiently address any 
concerns that may arise. All employees, whether permanent or non-permanent, 
have avenues to voice their grievances directly to their line manager or through 
our dedicated HR SPOC (Single Point of Contact). Upon receiving a grievance, we 
collaborate closely with the employee to comprehensively understand the issue 
and explore viable solutions. Our goal is to ensure that every concern is resolved 
effectively and in a timely manner, fostering a supportive and conducive work 
environment for all
Other than Permanent Employees
Permanent Workers
For Permanent workers, our grievance redressal mechanism extends to 
encompass a process for workers to express their concerns or grievances through 
their Workmen Representatives/Unions. We actively engage in joint meetings 
with these representatives to carefully address any grievances raised, ensuring 
that we offer timely feedback on the status of each grievance. This collaborative 
approach underscores our commitment to fostering open communication and 
resolving issues effectively, thereby promoting a harmonious and productive 
work environment.
Other than Permanent Workers
For workers who are not permanent, to ensure that the concerns of workers 
employed through contractors are acknowledged and resolved, we have 
implemented a dedicated grievance redressal mechanism tailored for them. 
Within this framework, contractors can raise grievances on behalf of their 
employees. We facilitate joint meetings with the contractors to thoroughly 
examine and resolve any issues that arise. Additionally, we mandate contractors 
to furnish regular updates on the status of grievances, promoting transparency 
and ensuring that all involved parties are informed of the progress being 
made in addressing concerns. This approach underscores our commitment to 
maintaining a fair and supportive work environment for all individuals involved 
in our operations.
6. 	
Is there a mechanism available to receive and redress grievances for the following categories of employees and 
workers? If yes, give details of the mechanism in brief. 
	
In facilities where unions are not operational, we implement an open-door policy to facilitate communication and address 
employee concerns. Employees are encouraged to reach out to designated points of contact such as the floor supervisor 
(clearly nominated and communicated), the welfare officer (similarly designated and communicated), or directly to the unit 
head. Additionally, some facilities feature suggestion boxes where employees can raise issues and provide suggestions 
for improvement.
	
Moreover, each unit is equipped with designated POSH (Prevention of Sexual Harassment) officers who are trained and 
readily accessible to all employees and workers. This ensures that a supportive and responsive environment is maintained, 
where employees feel empowered to voice their concerns and contribute to the overall well-being of the workplace. We 
ensure that all complaints are addressed by dedicated ethics and compliance personnel, with established channels 
available for reporting grievances, as detailed in Section A, Q25.

10. 	 Health and safety management system: 
	
a. 	
Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Yes/ No). 
If yes, what is the coverage of such a system?
	
	
Yes, The Company has deployed health and safety management system across all the sites, offices of Tata Consumer 
Products and in its exclusive third-party units. The coverage includes 5 offices, 11 Packeting centres, 2 Instant Coffee 
plants, Tetley, Instant Tea Operations, Himalayan Plant, Smartfoodz, 2 Soulfull plants, Hinganghat concentration 
plant and Hinganghat 3P plant.
	
b. 	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine 
basis by the entity? 
	
	
At TCPL, we employ several processes to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on both routine and non-
routine bases. Here's a breakdown of the processes involved:
	
	
Unified Risk Assessment Process: This process is deployed across all work locations. It involves systematically 
identifying potential work-related hazards involved in activities. These hazards are then mapped to each routine 
activity, and the associated risks are evaluated and categorized as High, Medium, Low, or Significant. This information 
is digitized for easy access and reference.
	
	
Assessment of Non-Routine Activities: Hazards associated with non-routine activities are assessed during the 
activity planning stage. This assessment is a collaborative effort between the operations team and the Health & 
Safety team. Weekly reviews are conducted to ensure that potential hazards are identified and addressed effectively.
	
	
Job Safety Analysis (JSA) and Permit to Work System: For all non-routine activities, a Job Safety Analysis (JSA) is 
conducted, and a permit-to-work system is adhered to before commencement of work. These processes ensure that 
potential risks are identified, and necessary precautions are taken to mitigate them.
	
	
Hierarchy of Risk Control Measures: The entity adopts a hierarchy of risk control measures to determine the most 
effective ways to mitigate identified risks. This includes conducting Job Safety Analysis (JSA) and Job Hazard Analysis 
(JHA) to identify and mitigate potential risks.
	
	
Implementation of Control Measures: Once the risk control measures are determined, the Operation Control 
Procedures are developed and they are implemented to mitigate identified risks effectively. Regular safety talks and 
Health & Safety (H&S) time-outs are provided to workers to communicate available control measures and ensure that 
all safety protocols are being followed.
	
	
By employing these processes, TCPL ensures a comprehensive approach to identifying work-related hazards, 
assessing risks, and implementing control measures to promote a safe working environment for its employees.
	
c. 	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such 
risks. 
	
	
In our organization, we have established comprehensive processes to facilitate the reporting of work-related hazards 
by workers and to enable them to remove themselves from such risks. Proactive reporting is a fundamental component 
of our health and safety management system, and we maintain entry records that meticulously document Unsafe 
Acts, Unsafe Conditions, Safe Acts, and Near Miss cases, which are promptly addressed to prevent incidents. To 
encourage workers to report hazards, we have implemented various reporting channels, including reporting slips, 
QR code reporting, documentation during toolbox talks, and informal interactions. Additionally, we conduct regular 
rewards and recognition programs across all operation sites to incentivize proactive safety actions. Furthermore, 
workers are empowered to remove themselves from situations where they perceive imminent risk to their health 
and safety, supported by clear protocols outlining the steps to take in such scenarios, such as notifying supervisors 
or safety personnel and relocating to a safe area. Through these measures, we aim to foster a culture of safety and 
maintain a secure work environment for all employees.
	
d. 	
Do the employees/workers of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services? 
	
	
Yes, TCPL prioritizes employee health and wellness and offers extensive medical benefits. Our staff receive medical 
insurance (group policies) and/or ESI for themselves and their families. The company also runs a dedicated hospital 
at the Munnar tea plantation for the benefit of employees and their families.

12. 	 Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy workplace. 
	
We have implemented various measures to ensure a safe and healthy workplace environment for all employees. These 
measures are outlined in our organization's Safety, Health & Wellbeing Policy, which has been signed by the CEO, 
underscoring the organization's commitment to this responsibility. Country heads are entrusted with the task of effectively 
implementing health and safety protocols in their respective areas of operations. Furthermore, there is a concerted effort 
to obtain Health & Safety management system certification to the international standard ISO 45001 by the Financial Year 
2026, with 84% of the operation sites in India having already achieved this requirement.
	
To monitor and improve health and safety performance, key performance indicators (KPIs) are set annually, encompassing 
both lagging indicators such as zero fatalities and reduction in Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR), as well as 
proactive measures including reporting of safety situations, safety trainings, and safety compliance audit scores. Senior 
management reviews health and safety performance on a monthly basis during discussions, while safety committee 
meetings are conducted monthly at all operation sites to further reinforce safety protocols.
	
Various systems and procedures have been implemented to enhance safety and health standards in the workplace, 
including robust hazard identification and risk assessment processes, management of change controls, and the provision of 
personal protective equipment (PPE) to minimize workplace hazards. Additionally, safety incident alerts are disseminated 
to all operational units for every incident, facilitating the sharing of lessons learned and horizontal deployment of safety 
measures.
	
Regular monthly Health & Safety timeouts are organized, during which all personnel in the workplace assemble under the 
supervision of site leadership for safety briefings. These initiatives collectively underscore the organization's dedication 
to maintaining a safe and healthy work environment for all employees, reflecting a proactive approach to ensuring their 
well-being. Please refer the ‘Employee Wellness’ section of this report for further details.

Yes. Our organization places utmost importance on addressing human rights issues and their associated impacts. Tata 
Consumer Products is deeply committed to safeguarding human rights, considering them integral to our business practices. 
Our human rights policy is in line with the Tata Code of Conduct and adheres to the principles outlined in the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and the United Nations 
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.
	
To effectively address human rights concerns, we have established both an Apex Human Rights Committee and a Business 
& Human Rights Working Committee in accordance with our policy. The Apex Committee, chaired by the MD & CEO, 
oversees policy compliance and integration into the company's strategy. It operates with well-defined responsibilities, key 
metrics, and a governance structure cascading throughout the organization.
	
Additionally, the Business & Human Rights Working Committee, chaired by the Global Legal Counsel, supervises the 
execution of our sustainability plan. It ensures alignment with our Business and Human Rights (BHR) policy across the 
organization by overseeing the activities of various working groups. This comprehensive approach underscores our 
commitment to upholding human rights principles throughout our operations.
5. 	
Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues. 
	
Tata Consumer Products Ltd. has instituted the Tata Code of Conduct, which serves as a framework for ethical business 
conduct. All stakeholders, including employees and partners, are mandated to report any suspected or actual breaches 
of the Code, company policies, or legal regulations. To facilitate such reporting, the Company has established an Ethics & 
Compliance Helpline, offering a confidential channel for raising concerns. All complaints are thoroughly investigated by 
designated ethics and compliance personnel, and appropriate actions are taken against individuals found to be at fault. 
This commitment to transparency, confidentiality, and fairness underscores TCPL’s dedication to ethical conduct and 
accountability.
	
We are in the process of developing a remediation framework aligned with our Business and Human Rights Policy. The 
key objectives of this framework are threefold:
	
•	
To receive and address concerns, complaints, notices of emerging conflicts, or grievances related to the Business and 
Human Rights Policy.
	
•	
To facilitate the resolution of any grievances arising between the company and stakeholders within the context of 
company operations.
	
•	
To operate transparently, collaboratively, and flexibly to foster problem-solving and consensus-building.
	
We anticipate the deployment of this framework soon, enhancing our ability to address and resolve issues related to 
business ethics and human rights effectively. We ensure that all complaints are addressed by dedicated ethics and 
compliance personnel, with established channels available for reporting grievances, as detailed in Section A, Q25.

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases.
	
We highly prioritize ensuring that our POSH (Prevention of Sexual Harassment) and Ethics Committee members are not only 
well-educated, but also understand the importance of maintaining confidentiality. We maintain a strict policy against any 
retaliation towards individuals who raise genuine issues, and any offenders will face disciplinary measures. To prevent any 
retribution and guarantee complainants that they can feel safe to voice their concerns, training and sensitization sessions are 
conducted for our POSH and Ethics Committee members. We also provide complainants with options for team or location 
changes, or even an extended leave if requested. We ensure that all complaints are addressed by dedicated ethics and 
compliance personnel, with established channels available for reporting grievances, as detailed in Section A, Q25.
9. 	
Do human rights requirements form part of your business agreements and contracts? (Yes/No)
	
We have integrated a Human Rights clause into all our supplier agreements to address critical issues such as forced labor, 
child labor, discrimination, working hours, wages, and disciplinary actions. Our vendors are obligated to establish ethical 
and human rights policies and implement effective procedures for addressing breaches of these policies.
	
Furthermore, the Supplier Code of Conduct is a compulsory component of all our supplier contracts. This code 
comprehensively covers Human Rights, Labor Standards, and Workplace Standards, reflecting our commitment to ethical 
business practices throughout our supply chain.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details. 
	
In FY24, TCPL made significant strides towards utilizing alternate sources of energy. Twelve rooftop solar power plants, 
with a total capacity of 3393 KWp, were installed across various factories. These plants generate clean renewable energy, 
reducing reliance on conventional sources and lowering our environmental footprint.
	
Additionally, alternate fuel projects were implemented in two factories. Soulfull Bidadi Factory introduced Piped Natural 
Gas (PNG) as an alternate fuel to Diesel and LPG, providing cost savings of Rs. 3.5 Lakhs per month and reducing emissions. 
ICD-Theni Factory converted roaster fuel from HSD to LPG, resulting in a 33% reduction in specific fuel consumption and 
annual cost savings of Rs. 1.12 Lakhs. These initiatives demonstrate the company's commitment to both environmental 
sustainability and cost efficiency.
	
Furthermore, several energy conservation measures were taken during the financial year 2023-2024. Himalayan Factory 
optimized fan speeds and automated pumps for significant kWh savings. ITO Factory reduced fuel consumption by 
utilizing solid fuel boilers and optimizing cleaning processes. They also reduced water usage and waste generation through 
process modifications. TSFL Factory optimized compressors, reduced unburnt fuel, and improved aeration and lighting 
systems. GOLP and KOLP Factories optimized aeration motor speeds and compressor run times for electricity savings. 
HBDP Factory implemented occupancy sensors and lighting upgrades, while also improving suction efficiency to reduce 
motor load. SAMP Factory optimized lighting and dust collector operations for energy savings. ICD-Theni Factory achieved 
significant reductions in electricity and boiler fuel consumption through process improvements and equipment upgrades 
like VFDs. Additionally, they implemented spent coffee utilization as a fuel source. ICD-Toopran Factory introduced an 
automated combustion system for better fuel efficiency, revamped their condensate recovery system, and redesigned 
boiler components to achieve substantial fuel savings. A total of Rs. 646.34 Lakhs were invested in energy conservation 
equipment across these factories. All these measures generated significant energy savings and reduced costs.

For Tata Consumers we have established a comprehensive grievance redressal mechanism that encompasses all our 
stakeholders. Effective engagement with the community and stakeholders necessitates a robust grievance redressal 
system that incorporates feedback loops and conflict resolution mechanisms. Our 24x7 grievance cell enables beneficiaries 
and affected community members to seek prompt redressal for their concerns. Moreover, we have implemented an internal 
structure to ensure timely resolution of issues, complaints, and grievances, facilitating swift and effective action when 
needed. We ensure that all complaints are addressed by dedicated ethics and compliance personnel, with established 
channels available for reporting grievances, as detailed in Section A, Q25.

information, the complaint will be documented in our system (Salesforce). Within 48 hours of documentation, our CC team 
will dispatch a replacement product to the client using an authorized courier service. A sample of the complaint will be 
obtained from the client and sent to our Bangalore office via a TCP authorized courier for further investigation. If the 
complaint is validated, it will be referred to the relevant department or plant for root cause analysis (RCA). The concerned 
team will then present their findings, along with a plan of action aimed at preventing the recurrence of similar complaints.
