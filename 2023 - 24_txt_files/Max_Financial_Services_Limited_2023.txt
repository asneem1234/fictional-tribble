Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets and 
achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure).
	
The increased use of resources is the main driver for the triple planetary crisis i.e. climate change, biodiversity loss and 
pollution. This takes our focus on how important it is to judiciously use the resources. Thus, responsible and sustainable 
production and consumption of resources is of utmost priority. At Max Life, we use energy efficient technologies, invest in 
emission reduction strategies and strive for effective waste and water management. We encourage employees to reduce their 
individual consumption patterns as well. Despite the Paris Agreement of 2015 reaching a milestone in cooperation amongst 
countries to limit global warming to 1.5oC, the pace of action has not been adequate to achieve the goal. The signatories to the 
Paris Agreement, including India, have submitted their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) and India has 
made the commitment to achieve the net zero target by 2070. Taking this goal at the corporate level, Max Life has committed 
to reduce carbon emissions by 80% by 2028. In the recent past, conscious investors have been on the rise across the country 
and worldwide who are not only concerned with financial disclosures, but also the non-financial disclosures of the Company. 
Nowadays, every Board Room discusses and deliberates on aspects related to Environmental, Social and Governance. While 
this trend has been started as a result of the need to abide by the statutory obligations, but the companies have started to 
overhaul their business structure to integrate sustainability at all levels. Corporates are expected to embrace ESG criteria 
not just for compliance or as risk management tool but as a chance to fundamentally transform their business model into a 
sustainable one.
	
The Company has charted four pillars of ESG: working ethically and sustainably, green operations, financial responsibility and 
care for people. These pillars guide the Company to take sustainable decisions for its functioning.

Essential Indicators
1.	
Describe the mechanisms in place to receive and respond to consumer complaints and feedback. 
	
MLI:
	
MLI has a robust grievance redressal process, guided by its grievance redressal policy (which can be accessed here 
https://www.maxlifeinsurance.com/content/dam/neo/pdf/Grievance_Redressal.pdf). MLI has created both robust processes 
and systems to receive, assess and respond to each customer complaint as part of its overall service framework, which includes 
specified service parameters in terms of turnaround TATs for each type of request. While the above document describes these 
in detail, broadly our framework for receiving customer complaints and responding to them is as below:
	
Steps taken to reduce customer complaints:
1.	
In an endeavor to reduce the number of complaints, basis a regular review of complaints received, we have revamped 
our customer onboarding process in the following ways to ensure that before the issuance of a policy, there is proper 
rechecking of the customer’s understanding about the product:
a.	
Need analysis of the prospects before selling as per the Product Suitability Matrix, a tool used to assess which product 
will be suitable to the prospect basis the need of the prospect (customer-product fit). The Investor Risk Profiler(IRP) 
is used in order to facilitate the selection of suitable investment funds for ULIP products.
b.	
Delivery based on OTP verification for physical(paper) policy packs to confirm receipt of the policy pack on time.
36 | BRSR 2023-24
c.	
Benefit illustrations are presented with the prospect in order to explain the illustrative benefits of the policy. A copy 
of the benefit illustration is included in the policy pack. The policy pack sent to policyholder also contains a key 
features document along with a copy of the signed/authenticated proposal form. Critical information of insurance 
policy (payment term, premium, mode, policy maturity date) shall be made visible prominently in the policy pack in 
order to ensure that customers do not miss important information.
d.	
Pre-issuance verification to confirm the customer’s understanding of the product. Wide range of questions covering 
top reasons cited in mis-selling complaints are asked.
e.	
Increased coverage of video-based verification on new business sales, including in vernacular languages.
2.	
We proactively track for high ageing cases at our end, without a customer complaining, that have breached service TAT 
thresholds and expedite these for closure as well.
	
Receiving consumer complaints:
	
We have a robust customer relationship management (CRM) system for receiving, registering and disposing complaints/
grievances. The Company also has in place systems to receive and deal with all kinds of calls, including voice/e-mail relating 
to complaints/grievances from customers.
1.	
We have various modes by which we accept customer complaints such as email, branch, helpline, and are also working on 
an online form for logging complaints. The head office and each branch office of the Company have a well-defined process 
for receiving and registering grievances. Requisite systems are in place to receive, record and address the same at all the 
touchpoints.
2.	
We also measure our customer satisfaction scores via the NPS framework through which we also receive service 
detractors. Based on the detractor voices we understand the issues faced by customers and use this feedback to identify 
potential improvement areas.
3.	
Requisite processes and systems are in place to address litigations (including appeals) filed by a policyholder before any 
competent authority or courts, including but not limited to Insurance Ombudsman, Consumer Forums, Civil Courts and 
higher courts.
Redressal and feedback
1.	
Acknowledgement & Resolution:
	
Grievance acknowledgement: On receipt of a Complaint/Grievance, we first assess it on the basis of its merits and nature. 
Thereafter, we send an acknowledgement, through SMS or email where available, to the customer within 3 working days 
of the receipt of the Grievance.
	
Grievance resolution: We endeavor to resolve the Complaint/Grievance within 14 calendar days of its receipt and each 
redressal or rejection of the issue gets conveyed vide email or letter, along with reasons. Such communication will also 
inform the Complainant about how the customer can pursue the Complaint/Grievance, if dissatisfied with the resolution 
provided. We endeavor to resolve all complaints/grievances to the satisfaction of our customers. A grievance is considered 
as disposed of and closed when:
• 
MLI has acceded to the request of the customer fully, or
• 
The customer has indicated in writing, acceptance of the response of the Company, or
• 
The customer has not responded to the Company within 8 weeks of the Company’s written response to the complaint/
grievance
	
After the resolution, if the customer approaches the Company within eight weeks, the original ‘complaint/grievance’ 
interaction will be re-opened for review of the earlier decision. Post reviewing the facts, the suitable resolution will be 
provided to the customer.
2.	
In case customers do not receive a response within the turnaround times, they can escalate the matter to the Grievance 
officer/Nodal officer at MLI. The List of Grievance Officers at Branch Offices is given on the website. If the customer 
remains dissatisfied with the resolution, she/he can further escalate the matter to Grievance Officers at Head Offices.
BRSR 2023-24 | 37 
3.	
We also have created a mediation platform, internal ombudsman where customers can appeal decisions prior to raising it 
to insurance ombudsman or courts.
4.	
If the complaint/grievance is not resolved in favor of the customer or partially resolved in favor of the customer, she/he can 
take up the matter before the Insurance Ombudsman.
5.	
We do thorough RCAs of each complaint received to identity areas of improvement and funnel these learnings into our 
process and technology transformation programs. These are regularly reviewed by our management.
2.

Steps taken to inform and educate consumers about safe and responsible usage of products and / or services.
	
At MLI, we believe that it is important that Indian consumers should be aware of the true purpose of life insurance. Various 
surveys by leading research agencies have indicated that, while the majority of Indians are aware of life insurance plans, 
ownership of term insurance is low, and consumers are not aware of the role life insurance can play in building a financially 
secure nation. MLI led the industry initiative on insurance awareness.
1.	
Campaign on the benefits of life insurance: MLI is working diligently to drive importance of financial protection with life 
insurance amongst people through varied media that include mass media campaigns, social media, public relations, 
knowledge articles on online portals and MLI website. We also drive insurance awareness through our proprietary 
researches India Protection Quotient & India Retirement Index Survey that we conduct at pre-defined intervals.
2.	
Campaign focusing on protection of consumers: Fraudulent activities and spurious calling to defraud life insurance 
consumers are a reality that the life insurance industry is tackling through individual and joint efforts. Messages on 
protecting oneself from such acts are disseminated to our current policyholders by including such messages into the 
majority of customer communication. Similar information is also shared through SMS and articles with policyholders, 
along with social media campaign on fraud awareness.
3.	
Campaign for customers: We regularly share relevant details about life insurance through direct mail to our existing 
customer base. Every month, we observe super customer week with an emphasis on increasing customer awareness and 
engagement. By communicating with consumers digitally once a month via various emails and SMSs, these sessions have 
assisted our customers in learning more about the benefits of life insurance.
