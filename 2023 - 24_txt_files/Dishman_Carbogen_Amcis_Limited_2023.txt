Dear Stakeholders, 
I welcome you to our FY2023-24 Business Responsibility and 
Sustainability Report (BRSR). I am proud to proclaim the 
continuation of our remarkable journey in the Sustainability and 
Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) area and emphasise 
our commitment to it. 
We continue to be innovative to reduce emissions and improve 
energy management through conservation, and energy-efficient 
production and design. Our air emissions (other than GHG) and 
Scope 1 emissions have reduced significantly as a result. We have 
also implemented a Zero Liquid Discharge system with primary, 
secondary and tertiary treatment facilities, which includes 
an effluent treatment plant, solvent stripper, multiple effect 
evaporator, aromatics recovery unit and reverse osmosis unit.
We value the stability of our multi-stakeholder relationships. 
We have a very humane approach with our employees, workers, 
suppliers, customers, and other value chain partners. We ensure we 
engage very deeply with our employees and wider community and 
align that with our purpose. We are highly committed and focused 
on ensuring a highly safe working environment for our employees 
and workers whether in the offices or in the manufacturing plants.
We recognize equality, inclusivity, and the importance of treating 
everyone with fairness. Together, we forge partnerships that break 
barriers and transform aspirations into tangible realities, ultimately 
creating a brighter future for all.
We have a strong track record of having robust governance 
practices which ensure transparency, accountability, and integrity. 
We have effective governance structures, committees, policies, 
and oversight processes to ensure an environment that is inclusive, 
engaged, and balanced. The ‘tone from the top’ is well and truly 
exhibited by the Board in all governance matters including ESG 
where it drives our ESG strategy, policies, implementation, and 
alignment with our purpose.
Thus, working on sustainability is imbibed in our ethos, and the 
same is reflected through our values and behaviour towards 
sustainability and stakeholders. As a company, we are always 
devoted to giving back to the environment, which is a small step 
towards a cleaner, better future.
