ANNEXURE III TO THE DIRECTOR’S REPORT
Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report
In recent years, there has been a significant rise in investor and stakeholder interest towards companies that prioritize Environmental, 
Social and Governance (ESG) practices. This trend has gained substantial momentum not only globally but also within India. Investors 
and stakeholders worldwide are increasingly drawn to companies that demonstrate a commitment to sustainability and corporate 
responsibility.
ESG investing has emerged as a prominent strategy, reflecting a broader shift towards prioritizing factors beyond financial returns. 
This approach considers a company's environmental impact, social responsibility and governance practices alongside traditional 
financial metrics. In India, this trend is evident as investors seek opportunities that align with their values and contribute to long-
term sustainable growth.
Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has taken significant steps to promote responsible business conduct and sustainability 
reporting among listed companies through the implementation of the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) 
framework. This framework mandates listed companies to disclose information aligned with the nine principles outlined in the 
National Guidelines on Responsible Business Conduct.
Under the BRSR framework, listed companies are required to provide comprehensive disclosures on various aspects of their 
operations, including environmental performance, social impact, governance practices, and efforts towards sustainable 
development. By adhering to these guidelines, companies are encouraged to integrate sustainability considerations into their 
core business strategies and operations.
The BRSR framework serves as a crucial tool for investors and stakeholders to assess companies' ESG performance and make 
informed investment decisions aligned with their values and objectives. Moreover, it facilitates dialogue and engagement between 
companies, investors, and other stakeholders, ultimately contributing to the advancement of sustainable development goals in 
India.
Music Broadcast Limited (MBL) stands committed to upholding ESG principles as fundamental pillars alongside financial and 
operational performance. Positioned as a significant private radio player within the Media & Entertainment Industry, MBL recognizes 
the pivotal role that digital platforms play in shaping content creation, distribution, consumption and engagement strategies in 
today's evolving media landscape.
In acknowledging the transformative influence of digital technologies on the media sector, MBL remains steadfast in leveraging 
these advancements while ensuring it fulfills its ESG responsibilities. This commitment underscores MBL's proactive efforts to embed 
sustainability considerations into its core business practices and operations.
As MBL embraces digital innovations to optimize content delivery and enhance audience engagement, it maintains a keen awareness 
of the broader implications for environmental sustainability, social impact, and corporate governance. By aligning its strategies with 
ESG principles, MBL aims to not only drive financial performance but also actively contribute to societal well-being.
By prioritizing sustainability and responsible business practices, MBL seeks to foster long-term value creation for its stakeholders 
and make a positive contribution to the wider community.
