implications)
1.
Human 
Capital 
Development
Risk / 
Opportunity
Opportunity: Our skilled 
employee base is 
instrumental towards the 
Company’s leadership 
position in the automotive 
marketplace space. A 
motivated talent pool 
with strong business 
and technical expertise 
helps deliver high quality 
products and innovation. 
We consistently invest 
in the growth and 
development of our 
employees to harmonise 
the expectations of our 
human capital with those 
of the Company’s growth 
strategy. 
Risk: Constant upskilling 
of the workforce is critical 
to build capabilities to 
navigate the evolving 
technological and 
business landscape. 
Inadequate human capital 
development and lack 
of skillset can lead to 
business disruption in 
such cases. Additionally, 
there exists strong market 
demand for skilled and 
experienced talent which 
poses a risk of high 
attrition and flight of talent.
We have put in place 
a robust mechanism 
to identify and recruit 
talent with required 
skills from leading 
engineering institutions 
and business schools 
as well as through 
internal employee 
referrals and 
independent external 
agencies.
We have adopted 
competitive 
compensation 
framework, and 
we benchmark our 
employee benefits and 
salary to ensure that our 
practices are in line with 
best industry standards. 
Our Learning and 
Development (L&D) 
programme is aimed 
at promoting career 
growth, leadership 
development, and 
gaining technical as well 
as soft skills through 
regular workshops and 
training sessions.
We have an equal 
opportunity culture that 
fosters diversity and 
inclusion within our 
workforce. We also 
have a transparent 
grievance redressal 
mechanism for 
managing employee 
concerns.
We also engage with 
our employees at 
regular intervals to seek 
their feedback on HR 
policies and practices 
and take corrective 
actions, wherever 
necessary.  
Positive: Development 
and retention of skilled 
talent helps business 
growth, productivity and 
innovation.
Negative: High attrition 
can impact productivity, 
efficiency and innovation 
which leads to business 
disruption and negative 
financial impact.

2.
Customer 
satisfaction
Opportunity
Opportunity: Customers 
lie at the heart of any 
business strategy, thus 
incorporating customer 
centricity is the only viable 
approach to achieve 
growth.
We have incorporated 
customer centricity 
within all our 
policies, practices, 
and strategies. We 
stress extensively 
on engagement with 
customers and seek 
feedback to refine our 
offerings. We ensure 
that the customer facing 
employees are well 
trained to effectively 
handle the needs 
and concerns of our 
customers and ensure 
their satisfaction with our 
products and services.
Positive: High customer 
satisfaction can lead to 
strong business growth. 
It can also help create a 
strong brand reputation 
and a loyal customer 
base who could be 
potential market for 
Company’s other 
existing/ new products 
and services.
3.
Data privacy 
& security
Risk
Risk: Cyber-attacks 
and data breaches 
are becoming major 
risks due to increasing 
digitisation and large-
scale use of technology 
and its integration 
across platforms. 
Vulnerable systems can 
compromise the security 
of intellectual property 
or critical data as well as 
confidential information 
of stakeholders, including 
personally identifiable 
information (PII) which 
could damage Company’s 
trust and reputation.
We are constantly in the 
process of strengthening 
our digital infrastructure 
in terms of technical 
safeguards and ongoing 
monitoring of new and 
existing threats. 
We have adopted a 
robust cybersecurity 
and data management 
framework and controls 
which is supervised 
by the Board and the 
senior management. 
We design our platforms, 
offerings, and policies 
to facilitate compliance 
with evolving privacy and 
data security laws and 
regulations.
We also regularly 
review our data and IT 
security policies and 
procedures and also 
conduct training and 
awareness sessions 
for our stakeholders to 
better equip them in 
dealing with instances 
of cyber-attacks and 
data breaches.
Additionally, in order 
to mitigate the risk of 
financial losses due 
to cyber-attacks, we 
procure cyber insurance 
policy to claim for 
losses, if any arises.
Negative: Weak data 
governance can result 
in data breaches which 
can damage reputation 
and impact business 
growth. It could also 
lead to legal liabilities 
which could result in 
additional financial 
burden. Investments 
in technology and 
digital infrastructure to 
strengthen IT systems 
will result in increased 
operational costs.

4.
Technology/ 
Digital 
adoption
Risk / 
Opportunity
Opportunity: State-of-
the-art technological 
infrastructure helps the 
business stay ahead of 
the curve. 
Risk: Rapid technological 
change, changes in 
user and customer 
requirements and 
preferences, frequent 
introduction of new 
services and products 
embodying new 
technologies, including 
apps, and the emergence 
of new industry standards 
and practices that could 
render our existing 
websites, apps and 
technology obsolete.
We have invested 
heavily in our 
technological 
capabilities across 
our platforms. We 
have an advanced 
and sophisticated 
technology platform. 
Our technology 
platforms are both 
scalable and vertically 
integrated across the 
entire value chain, 
which allows us to 
address each step 
of the vehicle life 
cycle. The end-to-end 
technology platforms 
largely developed by 
our in-house team 
allow us to offer a 
seamless solution to 
our customers.
Furthermore, we 
regularly conduct 
Vulnerability 
Assessment and 
Penetration Testing 
(VAPT) audit to identify 
any security flaws in the 
network and resolve it 
on priority.
Positive: Sophisticated 
technology helps 
improve efficiency 
levels and scaling up 
of business thereby 
helping growth.
Negative: Lack of 
adequate technological 
infrastructure can result 
in business becoming 
uncompetitive
5.
Energy 
management
Risk / 
Opportunity
Opportunity: Improvement 
in energy efficiency levels 
helps reduce carbon 
footprint and reduces 
operational costs. 
Risk: Energy management 
has assumed paramount 
importance considering 
the concerns surrounding 
increasing carbon 
emissions and climate 
change. Recognition of 
this risk has also meant 
evolution of stringent 
climate and environment 
related regulations which 
need to be adhered to.
Even though our 
business operations are 
not energy intensive 
in nature, we are 
committed to curtail 
energy consumption 
and improve energy 
efficiency levels within 
our operations. 
We promote energy 
saving awareness 
among our employees 
and try to reduce our 
consumption within our 
office spaces.
Positive: Energy 
efficiency and cost 
savings in the longer 
run, leading to more 
profitability
Negative: Upfront cost 
to be expended towards 
efficiency initiatives in 
the short term

Circular 
Economy and 
promotion 
of reuse/ 
refurbishment
Opportunity
Opportunity:
Resale of used vehicles 
is one of business 
segments of the 
Company. Wider adoption 
of circular economy 
fosters innovation and 
design of products 
(vehicles) designed for 
extended use through 
repair, refurbishment, or 
remanufacturing.
The Company is 
committed to create 
an environment 
of trust through 
our infrastructure, 
processes, and 4S 
(Sure, Secure, Safe, 
Smart) promise to 
guarantee quality of 
used vehicles sold on 
our platforms.
The Company also 
promotes the used 
vehicles through strong 
focus on advertisement 
and marketing.
Positive: Encouraging 
circular economy 
initiatives can lead to 
expansion of market 
opportunities for reused 
vehicles
7.
Community 
engagement
Opportunity
Opportunity: We look at 
community engagement 
through corporate social 
responsibility (CSR) as 
an opportunity for the 
Company to partake in the 
country’s socio-economic 
development.
The Company is 
committed to implement 
a comprehensive 
CSR programme 
which benefits the 
community on multiple 
fronts and disclose the 
impact generated by 
our projects. We also 
have put in place a 
mechanism to gather 
feedback basis which 
corrective actions can 
be taken, if any.
In FY24, we launched 
our CSR initiative 
powered by CarTrade 
Foundation namely 
DriveASmile. It is 
a unique initiative 
focussed on supporting 
the unsung heroes of 
the mobility industry by 
facilitating donations 
from individuals and 
businesses via a 
transparent, tech-
enabled platform and 
processes.
Positive: Implementing 
an effective CSR 
programme will help us 
build brand reputation 
and trust as we fulfil our 
social obligation.

greener future.

governance frameworks.

processes, which allows us to effectively manage ESG-related risks and opportunities, aligning our business strategies with our sustainability goals. We 
are committed to achieve our social and environmental targets & goals. This strategic direction helps us to create long-term value for all our stakeholders. 
Further, our dedication to delivering exceptional service to our customers is matched by our focus on the development and well-being of our employees. 
We continue to enhance our policies related to Learning & Development, Compensation, Employee Wellbeing, and Employee Engagement, fostering a 
culture of continuous improvement and growth. As we forge ahead on our sustainability journey, we are committed to transparent communication and

and outcomes of those operations. Last year, we had identified our internal and external stakeholders based on the 
direct impact on the operations and working of the Company the stakeholder had. In the process of identifying these key 
stakeholders, we considered input and feedback from various departments within the organisation, as well as from senior 
management. This collaborative approach ensured that the assessment was comprehensive to identify the stakeholders 
who hold the most importance and influence in relation to the Company’s activities. 
	
We engage with our stakeholders based on our Stakeholder Engagement policy which outline collaborative engagement 
with all stakeholders, using effective and responsive communication that makes it possible to forge relationships based 
on ongoing trust. By engaging in this process, the Company effectively manages its relationships and engages with key 
stakeholders to meet their expectations and address their concerns. This policy lays out a systematic approach towards 
management of stakeholder engagement practices and processes to maximise value for both the stakeholders and the 
Company and outlines the principles for identifying stakeholders, engaging and managing stakeholders.
