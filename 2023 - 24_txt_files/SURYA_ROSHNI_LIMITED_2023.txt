Energy 
Efficiency
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Energy 
management has 
been identified 
as a key material 
issue under Climate 
change and 
environmental risk. 
Climate Change and 
Environmental
risks are addressed 
to emphasise on the 
Company’s climate 
consciousness and 
its contribution 
towards mitigation 
action plans against 
climate change 
Opportunity: 
Comprehensive 
resource 
management plans 
in alignment with 
the Company’s 
environment 
conservation 
strategy will 
highlight the 
Company’s 
commitment 
for improving 
environment 
preservation and its 
contribution towards 
climate change 
mitigation action 
plans.
The Company focusses on four major areas related 
to climate change i.e. energy conservation, water 
conservation, use of renewable energy and waste 
minimisation.  The Company’s Environment, Health 
and Safety (EHS) Policy covers all employees and 
stakeholders across all manufacturing units. In 
lighting 
manufacturing 
processes, 
high-energy 
consumption equipment had been replaced with 
cost-effective energy efficient equipment. The 
Company regularly monitors the operations and 
capacity optimisation of pumps, motors and 
cooling tower operations, to take corrective actions. 
The Company is contributing towards the global 
environment by complying with ISO Certification 
i.e., ISO 9001, ISO 14001 & OHSAS 18001 under the 
Integrated Management System, in each and every 
process of the Company. The Company regularly 
assesses various environmental risks associated 
with its activities and its probable impact. The 
purpose of this procedure is to establish and 
maintain procedures for identifying environmental/
hazard aspects of activities. The manufacturing 
units have embraced initiatives on clean technology 
and energy efficiency. Innovative technologies have 
been implemented to reduce the impact on the 
environment. The Company has installed a solar 
panel at its manufacturing facilities at Bahadurgarh, 
and Malanpur Steel Plant and will be installing solar 
panels at all its other manufacturing units in times 
to come. In the longer term, the Company aims to 
reduce CO2 emissions and generate energy at a lower 
cost at its factories in India. This is in-sync with the 
Company’s approach towards building a sustainable 
ecosystem through efficient energy consumption 
and optimum utilisation of natural resources such 
as solar power and wind energy. Furthermore, this 
project will also enable significant operating cost-
savings for the Company such as lower energy 
loss, reduced electricity bills and maintenance
costs.
Positive: The 
Company’s focus 
on strengthening 
climate and ESG 
specific initiatives 
bolsters long-term 
value creation and 
enables the Company 
to effectively respond 
to rising stakeholder
demands
Negative: Lack of 
robust initiatives 
and action plans to 
contribute to ESG 
awareness and 
climate change could 
adversely impact 
business operations 
and lead to workforce 
disruption.

Human Rights 
Practices
Risk
Risk: The absence 
of a comprehensive 
Human Rights 
governance 
structure from 
the aspects of 
parameters such as 
working conditions, 
child/forced labour, 
fair remuneration, 
gender diversity, 
prevention of 
sexual harassment, 
freedom of 
association, and 
collective bargaining 
will impact the 
Company’s 
performance in the 
social domain from 
the perspective 
of the workforce 
as well as the 
community.
The Company respects the human rights of 
all relevant stakeholders and groups within 
and beyond the workplace, including that of 
communities, consumers and marginalised 
groups. All the practices and policies of 
the Company, including engagement with 
suppliers and contractors, among others, 
ensure that human rights are honoured and 
protected. To respect the human rights of 
our employees, including non-discrimination, 
prohibition of child and forced labour, freedom 
of association and the right to engage in 
collective bargaining. Surya Roshni strives 
to ensure that there is no discrimination 
or 
harassment 
due 
to 
gender, 
religion,
ethnicity 
and 
disability. 
We 
continuously 
work towards building a conducive work 
environment wherein merit in qualification 
and performance becomes the sole criteria 
for selection and performance appraisal and 
the work environment is free from all forms of 
harassment - physical, verbal, psychological, 
sexual etc. Integrating a strong governance 
structure for Human Rights from the aspects 
of the Human Rights Policy, the Freedom of 
Association Policy and Due Diligence across the 
business operations extending to supply chain 
partners and vendors
Positive: 
Comprehensive 
alignment of Human 
Rights principles in 
accordance with the 
guiding principles 
of national and 
international Human 
Rights standards
amplifies the 
Company’s 
performance in 
the social aspect 
and reflects its 
commitment towards 
human rights 
integration within the 
Company’s business 
model
Negative: The 
absence of a Human 
Rights governance 
structure could 
result in employee 
dissatisfaction, 
impacting 
the workforce 
productivity that 
could impact
the Company’s 
long-term business 
growth plan. The 
lack of a strong 
redressal mechanism 
may result in 
non-compliance 
issues from a 
relevant regulatory 
perspective

promoting diversity and inclusion, and ensuring the well-being of our 
employees. Our community engagement programmes have positively 
impacted thousands of lives, and we continue to support various

Good governance is essential to our success. We maintain robust 
governance structures to ensure transparency, accountability, and 
ethical conduct throughout our organisation. Our Board of Directors 
and management team are dedicated to upholding these principles and 
continuously improving our governance practices.
We understand that the journey towards sustainability is ongoing

1	
Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and 
social topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.
	
The Company’s response on Process: At Surya Roshni, the stakeholder engagement mechanism is a key driving force 
towards strengthening and diversifying the stakeholder relationship, which further facilitates the identification of key 
material issues impacting the Company’s growth. The principles of governance, ethics, integrity and transparency 
form a solid foundation that guides the Company’s progress. Stakeholder engagement led to the prioritization of 
material issues, mapping of the risks relevant to each material topic, and development of consequent risk mitigation 
strategies. The primary outcome of the stakeholder engagement exercise resulted in the identification and 
prioritization of material issues relevant to environmental, social, governance, and economic aspects. The identified 
material issues were presented to the highest governing member and the Board for their feedback and guidance 
on strategizing the sustainable growth model of the Company. As part of the Company’s efforts to continually 
engage with internal and external stakeholder groups for the identification of key material issues impacting them, 
the stakeholder engagement exercise undergoes periodic review. The Company’s Risk Management Committee is 
responsible for identifying risks that may impact company operations and developing policies and strategies to 
minimize and mitigate those risks as part of risk management effort.

allowing it to effectively work on its ESG strategies and be transparent about the outcomes. In response to current 
regulations and interactions with stakeholders, the Company performs periodic evaluations to update and reissue 
policies as needed.

Soda-lime Glass Flare & 
Exhaust tubes in place of Lead 
Glass, several processes are 
changed 
1. Flare cooling with high-pressure air 
increased
2. The annealing process is modified by 
increasing the length of the annealer
Through this process, the 
use of hazardous chemicals 
is reduced and major lead 
consumption has been 
stopped.  Also stopped 
importing hazardous lead 
glass scrap

Running Lamp recovery unit 
(Bulb Eater) for mercury lamp 
and recovering mercury for 
re-use
Installed Bulb Eater machine, in which we 
recover Glass Cullet, Phosphor Powder, 
Metal Cap, and Mercury separately
By doing this, the use of 
hazardous chemicals is 
reduced.
