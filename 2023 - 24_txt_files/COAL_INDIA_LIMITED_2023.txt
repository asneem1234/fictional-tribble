Statement by Director, responsible for the Business Responsibility Report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets and 
achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
In the face of global climate challenges, Coal India Ltd. Stands with India’s commitment to its Intended Nationally Determined 
Contributions (INDCs). The company is not just acknowledging the need for sustainable practices, but actively spearheading the 
transition towards renewable energy.
At the heart of this endeavor is the company’s ambitious pursuit of Solar Projects with ground solar capacity of 70.00 MWp and 
roof top solar capacity of 1.629 MWp added during 2023-24. This initiative is a clear demonstration of Coal India’s dedication 
to harnessing the power of renewable energy sources, thereby reducing reliance on traditional, environmentally harmful energy 
production methods.
Understanding the urgency to reduce its carbon footprint, Coal India has taken significant steps in adopting environmentally friendly 
transportation initiatives. A key focus has been on enhancing first-mile connectivity projects. These initiatives are not just about 
reducing emissions, but also about enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of the company’s operations. The goal is to create a 
ripple effect that extends beyond the company, contributing to a reduction in the overall environmental impact.
CIL’s commitment to environmental stewardship includes creating a green canopy in its mining areas through extensive tree 
plantation efforts. Efforts are underway to develop 50 additional eco-parks, mine tourism sites, and eco-restoration areas by FY 
2029, benefiting both local communities and the environment. Also, Coal India (CIL), as a responsible corporate citizen, actively 
enhances eco-friendly mining technologies in its production and coal transportation.
Emphasizing the development of local regions, promoting community growth, prioritizing employee wellness, endorsing quality 
education, ensuring accessible healthcare, and safeguarding biodiversity are the pillars of the Company’s philosophy and vision. The 
company’s pursuit of solar projects and the adoption of green transportation solutions are not isolated efforts. They are significant 
milestones in Coal India’s journey towards sustainability. 
BRSR reporting will serve as a powerful catalyst, enhancing the company’s comprehension and approach towards existing 
sustainability challenges in a more organized and thorough manner.

Yes. The Company has undertaken the adoption of a comprehensive set of Board-approved Environment and Sustainability 
Policies, with their implementation being carried out throughout the organisation to execute its ESG strategy. These policies 
serve as guiding principles to align CIL's goals with sustainability performance, identify significant sustainability concerns, 
and enhance monitoring and mitigation measures throughout the value chain. Moreover, the Company recognises that 
coal mining is a highly energy-intensive process that requires substantial fuel and power consumption. The majority of fuel 
usage is attributed to heavy earth moving machines (HEMMs), transportation, ventilation, and pumping activities, while 
a smaller portion is allocated to DG sets. In order to reduce its carbon footprint within its operational area, CIL is actively 
prioritizing energy efficiency measures and actively pursuing various carbon-offsetting initiatives.

and the practices adopted to manage such wastes. 
	
The company, recognizing the importance of waste management for sustainability, is dedicated to innovatively reducing 
and reusing waste. Overburden, a significant by-product of operations, is ingeniously transformed into a valuable resource 
by extracting sand. Mine water, typically considered waste, is repurposed for industrial and domestic use, benefiting 
both the company and surrounding communities. This approach not only enhances the company’s operations but also 
contributes to community welfare by providing water for drinking and irrigation. The complete e-Waste Disposal Policy 
can be accessed through the following link: https://d3u7ubx0okog7j.cloudfront.net/documents/CIL_Corporate_E-_Waste_

SAP ERP, an integrated Project Monitoring tool 
that revolutionizes the way they monitor and 
capture project data. This tool is integrated 
with all modules of SAP ERP and all ongoing 
project expenditure is done through the PS 
Module.
These initiatives have resulted in a reduction 
of 33,108 Tonnes of CO2 per annum due 
to the implementation of energy efficiency 
measures, and a reduction of CO2 emission 
by 16580 Tonnes per annum due to solar 
energy generation.
2
Energy Conservation 
Measures
The entity has taken several measures for 
energy conservation, such as the use of energy 
efficient appliances and improvement in 
power factor by installing capacitor banks of 
appropriate KVAR rating.
3
Solar Energy 
Generation
The entity is pursuing the use of renewable energy 
sources and has generated a total of 202.19 Lakh 
units of solar energy during 2023-24.

First Mile connectivity 
projects
This is a mechanized coal transportation 
and loading system. 35 FMC projects with a 
capacity of 351 MT are operational & 57 FMCs 
are under construction/ proposed taking the 
total capacity to 988 MT.
These FMC projects will help reducing 
CO2-e emission reduction by 1.186 
Million MT per year.

Production of sand 
from Over burden
Overburden is waste material excavated while 
mining. Coal India Limited has set up OB to 
sand plants. 
Sand produced from OB to sand pants is 
utilized in stowing, construction purpose. 
56678 CuM sand is produced and used is

environment, arising from the value chain of the 
entity. What mitigation or adaptation measures 
have been taken by the entity in this regard? 
	
The company uses coal, mainly from CIL, as the primary 
fuel for its Thermal Power Plants (TPPs) to generate 
electricity. However, this process is associated with 
the production of air pollutants and fly ash. To counter 
these environmental impacts, the company’s TPPs are 
equipped with Electrostatic Precipitators (ESP) and 
Flue Gas Desulphurization (FGD) units, significantly 
reducing air pollution.
	
Moreover, the company ensures that the fly ash 
produced during power generation is not wasted. It is 
extensively used in various industries, including cement 
manufacturing and brick production. It is also used 
for filling voids and road construction, contributing to
