Climate
Strategy
Risk
OHL acknowledges that climate 
change presents both risks and 
opportunities that are essential 
to address for the sustainability 
of its operations. The recognition 
of 
climate-related 
risks 
– 
including 
regulatory 
shifts, 
resource scarcity, and physical 
impact to assets– compels OHL 
to integrate a robust Climate 
Strategy into its business model. 
This focus on climate resilience 
ensures compliance, operational 
continuity, and asset protection.
OHL’s 
climate 
strategy 
is 
underscored by the integration 
of 
Renewable 
Energy 
(RE), 
energy efficiency interventions 
and other resource conservation 
actions. The company is shifting 
towards renewable sources like 
solar and wind energy to power 
its operations, reducing reliance 
on fossil fuels and curbing 
emissions. Alongside, OHL is 
upgrading its properties with 
energy-efficient 
technologies, 
encompassing 
state-of-the-art 
HVAC systems, lighting, and 
smart 
building 
solutions 
to 
minimise energy consumption.

(Indicate

Opportunity
Simultaneously, the company 
seizes 
opportunities 
for 
competitive advantage through 
the 
adoption 
of 
energy-
efficient practices that promise 
cost savings, enhance brand 
reputation, 
foster 
innovation 
and align with the growing 
market demand for eco-friendly 
tourism experiences. Moreover, 
OHL’s Climate Strategy bolsters 
its commitment to stakeholder 
engagement by meeting the 
environmental 
expectations 
of 
guests, 
attracting 
talent, 
and uplifting communities. By 
proactively pivoting towards a 
climate-conscious 
framework, 
OHL not only mitigates risks 
associated 
with 
a 
changing 
climate 
but 
also 
captures 
the 
potential 
for 
market 
differentiation, 
ensuring  
long-term business prosperity 
and shareholder value in a 
world increasingly focused on 
sustainability.
The OHL Business Continuity 
and Disaster Response Plan has 
been developed to safeguard 
the smooth operation of critical 
business functions and ensure 
the well-being of guests and 
employees 
during 
disruptive 
incidents or disasters. These 
actions not only mitigate climate 
related 
risks 
by 
enhancing 
operational 
resilience 
and 
resource 
optimisation 
but 
also position OHL  as a leader 
in 
sustainable 
hospitality, 
committed 
to 
reducing 
its 
environmental 
footprint 
and 
catering to the sustainability 
expectations 
of 
guests 
and 
investors.
Positive implications
Emission 
and Energy 
Management
Opportunity
Risk
Emission 
and 
energy 
management 
represent 
a 
material opportunity for OHL 
in terms of cost reduction, 
regulatory 
compliance, 
and 
brand 
enhancement. 
By 
implementing 
energy-efficient 
technologies 
and 
reducing 
emissions, 
OHL 
can 
lower 
operational expenses, comply 
with 
increasingly 
stringent 
environmental 
regulations, 
and enhance its reputation as a 
sustainable hospitality provider. 
However, if emissions and energy 
consumption are not managed 
effectively, 
the 
consequences 
can be significant, including a 
rise in operational expenses due 
to inefficiencies and increased 
energy 
prices. 
Additionally, 
non-compliance regulations can 
result in fines from regulatory 
bodies, while the company’s 
public image may suffer, leading 
to a potential loss of customer 
trust and market share.
To mitigate energy and emission 
management risks, OHL has 
implemented 
energy-efficient 
technologies, such as solar hot 
water systems, heat pumps, 
and waste heat recovery units, 
leading to significant energy 
savings. The company has also 
transitioned to LED lighting, 
introduced 
energy 
efficient 
laundry systems and installed 
advanced air conditioning units. 
These initiatives not only reduce 
OHL’s environmental impact but 
also mitigate the financial and 
reputational 
risks 
associated 
with energy and emissions.

Waste 
Stewardship
Opportunity
Efficient 
waste 
management 
is essential for OHL due to the 
large volume of waste generated 
by the global hotel operations. 
Inadequate 
waste 
handling 
can 
harm 
the 
environment 
and communities, while also 
increasing 
disposal 
costs. 
By 
implementing 
effective 
waste reduction and recycling 
measures, the company can 
save 
costs, 
maintain 
clean 
properties and demonstrate its 
commitment to sustainability.
At OHL, all biodegradable waste 
undergoes 
composting, 
with 
6 hotels equipped with onsite 
composters. Initiatives are in 
progress to eradicate single-use 
plastic disposables, including 
the complete elimination of 
plastic straws and the planned 
substitution of PET bottles with 
glass bottles for serving drinking 
water in guest rooms and 
banquets. Additionally, 4 bottling 
plants have been established 
across all properties to facilitate 
the transition towards plastic-
free services on a larger scale.
Positive implications
Food Safety 
and Quality 
Opportunity
Implementing 
robust 
food 
safety measures presents an 
opportunity for OHL to enhance 
customer satisfaction, uphold 
its reputation for excellence 
and comply with regulatory 
standards. 
By 
ensuring 
the 
highest standards of food safety 
and quality, OHL can attract and 
retain customers, leading to 
increased revenue and loyalty.
OHL enforces rigorous food 
safety 
protocols, 
conducts 
routine 
inspections 
and 
provides ongoing training to 
staff members to ensure strict 
adherence to hygiene standards.
Positive implications
Talent 
Management 
and 
Retention
Risk
Failure to attract, retain and 
develop top talent can hinder 
organisational 
performance, 
innovation  and competitiveness. 
In the hospitality industry, where 
service excellence is integral, a 
skilled and motivated workforce 
is 
essential 
for 
delivering 
exceptional guest experiences. 
Additionally, talent shortages, 
particularly 
in 
specialised 
roles such as chefs, concierge 
and 
hospitality 
management 
can 
exacerbate 
operational 
challenges.
To address the risks associated 
with 
talent 
management, 
OHL 
strategically 
provides 
competitive 
compensation 
to attract quality talent. The 
company 
emphasizes 
career 
progression, giving employees 
a clear vision of their growth 
potential within the organization. 
Furthermore, OHL is dedicated 
to nurturing a positive and 
engaging 
work 
environment, 
which 
is 
instrumental 
in 
retaining a skilled and motivated 
workforce.
Negative Implications
Opportunity
Effective talent management at 
OHL unlocks opportunities to

employees 
serve 
as

Guest 
Experience
Opportunity
Customer experience directly 
impacts 
guest 
satisfaction,

and 
ultimately, 
the 
Company’s 
bottom 
line. 
OHL operates in the highly 
competitive hospitality industry, 
where 
exceptional 
service 
and personalised experiences 
are important. By prioritizing 
customer 
experience, 
OHL 
can differentiate itself from 
competitors, 
build 
strong 
brand loyalty and attract repeat 
business.
OHL’s 
commitment 
to 
exceptional guest experiences is 
evident through its integration 
of innovative technologies and 
personalised service. Embracing 
local culture, each hotel crafts 
custom experiences to enchant 
guests with Taj’s renowned 
intuitive 
service. 
The 
OHL 
Response Assistant (IRA), an 
AI-powered chatbot, optimises 
operations, while I-DOCS, an 
omnichannel platform, enriches 
guest interactions. Furthermore, 
OHL’s I-ZEST platform enhances 
operational efficiency and safety, 
allowing guests to seamlessly 
manage 
check-ins, 
access 
amenities and settle bills via 
their devices.
Positive implications
Supply Chain 
Management
Opportunity
Supply 
chain 
management 
presents 
a 
significant 
opportunity for OHL to enhance 
operational efficiency, reduce 
costs 
and 
improve 
guest 
satisfaction. 
By 
optimising 
its 
supply 
chain, 
OHL 
can 
streamline 
procurement 
processes, ensuring the timely 
delivery of high-quality goods 
and services to its properties. 
Moreover, 
a 
well-managed 
supply chain enables OHL to 
maintain consistent standards 
across its properties, ensuring a 
seamless guest experience.
OHL is dedicated to modernising, 
streamlining and implementing 
a process-oriented approach to 
the supply chain function, which 
serves as the backbone for its 
diverse portfolio of hotels. OHL 
collaborates 
with 
numerous 
supplier partners across the 
country and have established 
efficient 
standard 
operating 
procedures 
to 
systematically 
meet quality, cost and delivery 
objectives. 
The company’s supply chain 
management 
prioritises 
the 
efficient deployment and optimal 
utilisation of resources while 
integrating dispersed supplier 
base into the organisational 
culture and ethos.

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, 
targets and achievement
Mr. Pramod Ranjan (Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer): In today’s rapidly evolving business environment, 
the imperative to build a sustainable, comprehensive, and secure future has never been more pressing. We are fully 
dedicated to aligning our Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) measures with our strategic business objectives. 
Our significant accomplishments in environmental sustainability include the certification of seven (7) hotels under Earth 
Check, with six (6) achieving the prestigious Platinum Certification. Throughout the year, we have diligently pursued the 
implementation of Paathya, IHCL’s leading-edge ESG+ Program, setting formidable milestones for a range of ESG initiatives 
to be accomplished by 2030.
We continue to focus on decarbonizing our operations by implementing measures like phasing out single-use plastics and 
adopting other sustainability initiatives. Additionally, we have established green power arrangements for several of our 
properties and maintain a comprehensive program to collaborate with our supply chain partners.
We remain committed to prioritizing competitive solutions that foster livelihood creation across our entire value chain, all 
while promoting environmental benefits. Our employees are integral to our business’s foundation and success.
We are immensely grateful to our colleagues for their dedication and care towards our community and customers. 
Empowering and enabling our employees to execute our strategic priorities, with sustainability as the guiding principle in 
all our endeavors, is paramount to achieving our long-term goals.

10.	 Health and safety management system:
a.   Whether an occupational health and safety 
management system has been implemented 
by the entity? (Yes/No)
Yes
What is the coverage of such system?
The system covers all employees & workers and all hotels. 
b. What are the processes used to identify 
work-related hazards and assess risks on a 
routine and non-routine basis by the entity?
Routine Risk Assessment Processes
− Regular Safety Audits and Inspections: OHL conducts periodic 
safety audits and inspections across all properties. These audits 
are designed to identify existing hazards and potential risks 
in the daily operations of the hotels. The audits cover various 
aspects including fire safety, electrical installations, kitchen 
operations, and guest areas
− Employee Reporting Mechanisms: Employees are encouraged 
to report hazards immediately using an incident reporting 
system. This proactive engagement helps in early identification 
of routine risks that may arise during daily operations.
Non-Routine Risk Assessment Processes
− Dynamic Safety Risk Assessments: In response to specific 
incidents or external changes, such as construction activities 
or the introduction of new equipment, OHL conducts dynamic 
safety risk assessments. These assessments involve revisiting 
and analysing the potential impacts of the new variables on 
existing safety protocols (change management).
− Comprehensive Pre-Construction Risk Analysis: Before the 
commencement of any new construction or major renovation 
projects, a thorough risk analysis is conducted. This analysis 
focuses on identifying potential hazards associated with 
new construction activities, including high-risk tasks and 
environmental impacts. It helps in planning safety measures and 
emergency responses tailored to the specific risks identified.

understanding non-routine hazards and in developing corrective 
measures to prevent recurrence.
Ongoing Improvements and Feedback Integration
− Feedback Mechanisms: Feedback from employees and safety 
audits are continuously analysed to update risk assessment 
methodologies. This integration ensures that both routine and 
non-routine processes are refined over time to enhance safety 
outcomes.
− Best Practice Sharing: Learnings from both routine and non-
routine assessments are shared across the organisation through 
periodic Safety and Security Policy (S&S) updates and inter-
hotel safety forums. This practice helps in standardising safety 
measures and improving risk assessments across all properties.

access to non-occupational medical and 
healthcare services? (Yes/ No) 
Yes, all sites have access to medical and healthcare services for 
non-work-related needs, either on-site or through partnerships 
with trusted healthcare providers in the vicinity. Furthermore, 
employees receive training for on-site medical emergency 
response.
