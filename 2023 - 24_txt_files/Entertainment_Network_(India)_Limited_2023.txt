This year, we made a significant 
strategic move by acquiring Gaana, 
marking our entry into the rapidly 
growing digital music streaming 
sector. This acquisition is a pivotal 
step in our strategy to diversify our 
media portfolio and tap into the 
increasing demand for digital music 
services. By leveraging Gaana’s 
established market presence, we 
are well-positioned to unlock its 
full potential, driving growth and 
enhancing the platform to deliver 
sustained value to our stakeholders.
In line with our commitment to 
enriching content and improving 
user 
experience, 
we 
have 
successfully integrated the Mirchi 
Plus app into Gaana. Mirchi Plus, 
known for its original audio stories, 
Bollywood video content, and text 
stories, now complements Gaana’s 
diverse offerings, creating a unified 
and comprehensive entertainment 
platform. The rebranded platform, 
‘Gaana Powered by Mirchi,’ is 
designed to provide an enhanced 
and seamless entertainment 
experience, further solidifying our 
leadership in the audio content 
space.
As we look forward, we are excited 
to launch Gaana 2.0, an upgraded 
version of the platform that will 
feature an expanded content library 
and significant improvements in 
functionality. By incorporating 
advanced technologies and AI-
driven enhancements, Gaana 2.0 
is poised to set new standards in 
digital entertainment, ensuring it 
resonates with a broad audience 
and remains at the forefront of 
innovation in the coming fiscal year.
Gaana currently supports 14 Indian 
languages, along with Hindi and 
English, with major user engagement 
in Hindi, English, and Punjabi. We 
are also seeing increased interest in 
Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, 
Bhojpuri, and Haryanvi content, 
reflecting the platform’s growing 
appeal across diverse linguistic 
demographics. Notably, our user 
base is diverse, with 40% hailing 
from Tier 1 cities and 60% from Tier 
2 cities.
A Strategic Expansion into Digital Music Streaming
As part of our commitment to 
providing value, Gaana will continue 
as a fully subscription-based service, 
offering premium features and 
an extensive content library at a 
competitive price. This approach 
ensures that Gaana remains a 
compelling and affordable choice in 
the digital entertainment landscape, 
aligning with our broader goal of 
delivering high-quality content and 
innovative features to our users.

Crafting Customized Brand 
Solutions with Innovation and 
Impact – FY24 Milestones
At the core of our success is Mirchi 
Brewery, an energetic and creative 
hub responsible for driving the 
ideation, planning, and execution of 
campaigns that cater to the specific 
needs of our clients. This dedicated 
unit blends creativity with strategic 
insight, allowing us to craft bespoke 
content solutions that speak directly 
to today’s audiences. We understand 
that consumers increasingly 
prioritize meaningful experiences 
over individual platforms, and our 
focus on delivering engaging content 
across FM radio, digital channels, 
social media and television ensures 
that our clients’ brands can 
connect with consumers across all 
touchpoints. By approaching content 
creation from a cross-platform 
perspective, we maximize both the 
reach and impact of our campaigns.
The success of this approach is 
reflected in the growth of our Multi 
Media Solutions segment, where 
our client base has expanded by 
2.6x over the last four years. This 
growth highlights our commitment 
to understanding the rapidly 
changing needs of the market and 
adapting our solutions to stay 
ahead of industry trends. Our focus 
on expanding our digital content 
offerings has enabled us to craft 
more engaging and impactful 
campaigns, giving us the ability 
to connect with audiences in 
deeper and more meaningful ways. 
Furthermore, our growth in social 
media influencer campaigns has 
allowed us to tap into authentic, 
relatable content that resonates 
with consumers and builds stronger 
brand connections. This expanded 
approach to media solutions has 
significantly enhanced our ability to 
deliver customized campaigns that 
are not only effective but also truly 
reflective of the evolving landscape 
of consumer engagement.
While our commercial achievements 
have been remarkable, Mirchi’s 
impact extends beyond traditional 
brand solutions. We have been 
deeply involved in several significant 
government collaborations, driving 
campaigns that aim to promote 
cultural heritage, civic engagement, 
and social responsibility. A standout 
example of our contribution 
is the ‘Meri Maati, Mera Desh’ 
campaign, executed in partnership 
with the Ministry of Culture. This 
initiative celebrates India’s rich 
cultural heritage, emphasizing the 
importance of national pride and 
cultural preservation. Through our 
innovative approach to content 
creation, we were able to create 
a campaign that not only engaged 
audiences but also deepened their 
connection to India’s cultural legacy.
Over the past year, Mirchi has continued to evolve and redefine its role as a leading provider of customized 
brand solutions, establishing itself as a creative powerhouse capable of delivering campaigns that resonate 
on multiple levels. Our diverse offerings, which span traditional radio, digital content creation, and live events, 
have positioned Mirchi as a comprehensive media entity with the ability to deliver innovative, high-impact 
brand engagement.

In addition to this, we spearheaded 
the ‘Anant Sutra’ project, another key 
initiative aimed at highlighting and 
preserving India’s diverse cultural 
narratives. This project reflects 
our commitment to promoting 
content that transcends commercial 
objectives, focusing instead on 
fostering a deeper appreciation for 
the stories and traditions that shape 
our nation.
Mirchi’s expertise in delivering 
impactful campaigns also extends 
to its collaboration with the Election 
Commission of India, where we have 
played a crucial role in advancing 
democratic participation across the 
country. One of our most notable 
campaigns, ‘Desh Ka Form’, was 
designed to simplify the voter 
registration process and encourage 
greater electoral participation. 
This initiative was instrumental 
in raising awareness about the 
importance of civic engagement 
and ensuring that the message of 
democratic participation reached 
a wide audience. Alongside this, 
we also executed the ‘Voters Day’ 
campaign, which aimed to honor the 
significance of voting and reinforce 
the power of each citizen’s vote. Our 
involvement in the outreach efforts 
for the Lok Sabha Election, one of 
the most significant democratic 
exercises in the world, further 
demonstrates our commitment to 
supporting democratic processes 
and ensuring that essential 
information is disseminated to every 
corner of the nation.
Our contributions also extend 
to the promotion of women’s 
sports, particularly through our 
collaboration with the Jharkhand 
Government to elevate the profile of 
women’s hockey. This initiative was 
designed to inspire young athletes 
and bring greater attention to the 
role of sports in empowering women. 
By focusing on the development 
of women’s hockey, we aimed to 
create a platform that not only 
highlighted the achievements of 
female athletes but also encouraged 
broader societal support for women 
in sports.
Through these various campaigns, 
Mirchi has showcased its ability to 
deliver customized, high-impact 
solutions for commercial brands 
while also playing a pivotal role 
in supporting initiatives that con-
tribute to the nation’s cultural, 
civic, and social development. Our 
dedication to creating content that 
transcends traditional advertising 
objectives, coupled with our com-
mitment to social impact, solidi-
fies Mirchi’s position as not just a 
media company, but a catalyst for 
positive change in society.

Mirchi Impact Property Solutions: 
Mirchi’s Key Properties Make a 
Triumphant Return in FY24
In addition to our Bespoke Solutions, FY24 marked the resurgence of several key Impact Properties that had 
taken a pause during the COVID period. These included the return of Mirchi Freshers, our popular college 
connect program; Mirchi Spell Bee, the country’s largest spelling competition and engagement initiative for 
school children; the Green Marathon, a major event focused on sustainability; and Concerts . These initiatives 
not only reconnected us with our audiences but also underscored our commitment to fostering educational 
and environmental awareness.
Sustainability was at the forefront 
with the highly anticipated return 
of the Mirchi Green Marathon, which 
made a grand comeback in March 
2024 after a three-year hiatus. 
As India’s premier sustainability-
focused marathon, this event, held 
in collaboration with SBI Bank, 
embraced a zero-waste philosophy, 
showcasing our commitment to 
environmental responsibility. The 
marathon utilized compostable and 
recyclable materials throughout, 
and featured clear signage to 
facilitate effective waste separation, 
setting a new standard for eco-
friendly events.
Sustainability Takes Center 
Stage: Mirchi Green Marathon 
and Green Yodha Lead the 
Charge in FY24
Mirchi Spell Bee, a flagship property 
of Mirchi, stands as India’s largest 
school-level spelling competition. 
In FY24, we proudly launched 
Season 13 of this prestigious 
event. Mirchi Spell Bee engages 
students through a comprehensive 
school contact program and digital 
platforms, including our dedicated 
website and WhatsApp. Participants 
compete through multiple levels for 
the chance to secure the top spot, 
creating an exciting journey for all 
involved.
Hosted by Mandira Bedi and 
sponsored by SBI Life this year, the 
competition garnered impressive 
results, including over 1.5 million 
social media impressions, a reach 
of 24 million through radio, and 2.5 
million in print. These achievements 
underscore the event’s success 
in providing an enriching and 
rewarding experience for students.
Additionally, other school events 
like Splash, Star Kids, Kiddie Fest, 
and Mudhal Padhi also experienced 
notable growth, reflecting our 
commitment to expanding and 
enhancing educational engagement 
across various platforms.

Premier School-Level Spelling 
Competition Shines in FY24 
along with other School 
Connect Events
In addition to the marathon, the 
Mirchi Green Yodha initiative 
made a significant environmental 
impact by planting 50,000 trees 
in Ahmedabad. This endeavour 
highlights our ongoing dedication 
to green practices and community 
involvement, contributing to the 
enhancement of urban green spaces 
and supporting environmental 
sustainability.
Looking ahead to FY25, Mirchi is set 
to expand its sustainable initiatives 
even further. We plan to bring our 
environmental efforts to over 20 
cities across India, amplifying 
our commitment to fostering a 
greener, more sustainable future. 
This expansion will include scaling 
up our successful Green Marathon 
and Green Yodha projects, as well 
as introducing new initiatives aimed 
at promoting sustainability and 
environmental consciousness on 
a national scale.

Launched nearly a decade ago as 
Mirchi’s first international venture, 
the UAE continues to be our 
flagship market in the GCC region. 
Over the past eight years, we have 
established a strong presence in the 
UAE through a strategic partnership 
with Abu Dhabi Media Company. 
After a brief hiatus, we returned 
to the market in March 2021, 
partnering with Dolphin Recording 
Studio in Dubai. Since its relaunch, 
Mirchi 102.4FM has quickly built 
a loyal audience, reinforcing its 
status as a leading brand in the 
region. Signature events such as 
Mirchi Jam, Back to School, and 
Terminal have gained significant

educational institutions. Our strong 
engagement is also evident in our 
social media presence, where our 
RJs and official social media assets 
rank second among ten competing

Our journey in Bahrain began in 
2019 when we entered the bidding 
process for a station license.

launched the station on May 9, 2021.

us to achieve healthy profits for 
the year, and we are now focused

Members may note that the Income Tax Act, 1961 
mandates that dividend paid or distributed by a Company 
after April 1, 2020 shall be taxable in the hands of the 
Shareholders. Your Company shall therefore be required 
to deduct Tax at Source (TDS) at the time of making the 
payment of dividend. In order to enable us to determine 
the appropriate TDS rate as applicable, Members are 
requested to submit the documents in accordance with 
the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
a)	
For Resident Shareholders, TDS shall be deducted 
under Section 194 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 @ 
10% or as notified by the Government of India on 
the amount of dividend declared and paid by the 
Company during the financial year 2024-25 provided 
PAN is registered by the Shareholder. However, no 
TDS shall be deducted on the dividend payable 
to a resident individual if the total dividend to be 
received by them during the financial year 2024-
25 does not exceed ` 5,000. Please note that this 
includes the future dividend, if any, which may be 
declared by the Board in the financial year 2024-25. 
Separately, in cases where the shareholder provides 
Form 15G (applicable to any person other than a 
Company or a Firm) / Form 15H (applicable to an 
individual above the age of 60 years), provided 
that the eligibility conditions are being met, no 
TDS shall be deducted. Resident shareholders may 
also submit any other document as prescribed 
under the Income Tax Act, 1961 to claim a lower / Nil 
withholding tax.
If PAN is not registered, TDS shall be deducted @ 
20% or as notified by the Government of India as per 
Section 206AA of the Income Tax Act, 1961. 
No TDS will be deducted in case of resident individual 
shareholders who furnish their PAN details and 
whose dividend does not exceed ` 5,000. However, 
where the PAN is not updated in in the records of 
the Company/ KFinTech/ Depository Participants or 
in case of an invalid PAN, the Company will deduct 
TDS under Section 194 read with Section 206AA 
and 206AB of the Income Tax Act, 1961 without 
considering the exemption limit of ` 5,000.
All the shareholders are requested to update their 
PAN with their Depository Participants (if shares are 
held in electronic form) and Company / KFinTech (if 
shares are held in physical form). Please quote all 
the folio numbers under which you hold your shares 
while updating the records.
Members who are required to link Aadhaar number 
with PAN as required under Section 139AA(2) of the 
Income Tax Act, 1961, read with Rule 114AAA thereto, 
should compulsorily link the same within the 
stipulated date. If, as required under the applicable 
law, any PAN is found to have not been linked with 
Aadhaar within the prescribed due date, then such 
PAN will be deemed invalid and TDS would be 
deducted at higher rates under Section 206AA of the 
Income Tax Act, 1961. The Company reserves its right 
to recover from the Member any demand raised 
subsequently on the Company for not informing 
the Company or providing wrong information about 
applicability of Section 206AA of the Income Tax Act, 
1961.
b)	
For Non-resident Shareholders, TDS is required to 
be deducted in accordance with, the provisions of 
Section 195 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 at the rates in 
force. As per the relevant provisions of the Income 
Tax Act, 1961, the tax shall be deducted @ 20% (plus 
applicable surcharge and cess) or as notified by the

Financial Performance, Operations and the state 
of the Company’s affairs 
 The total income of the Company increased from

lakhs during the year under review. Loss after tax declined 
from ` (17,359.08) lakhs during the previous year to profit 
of ` 2,813.72 lakhs during the year under review.
On a consolidated basis, the total income of the Company 
increased from ` 53,765.88 lakhs during the previous year 
to ` 56,325.25 lakhs during the year under review. Loss 
declined from ` (16,463.24) lakhs during the previous year

There were no material changes and commitments 
affecting the financial position of the Company which 
have occurred between the end of the financial year of 
the Company to which these financial statements relate 
and the date of this Report. There has been no change in 
the nature of the business of the Company. 
In December 2023, the Company executed the Business 
Transfer Agreement (‘BTA’) with Gamma Gaana Limited 
(‘GGL’) for acquisition of the business undertaking of GGL 
relating to the business of licensing music audio content 
and hosting and streaming services under the name 
‘Gaana’, on a going concern basis through a slump sale, 
48
Board of Directors’ Report
Entertainment Network (India) Limited
for a lump sum cash consideration of Rupees twenty five 
lakhs. Gaana is in the business of providing subscription 
based Music Streaming Service.
The high licensing fees and ongoing losses rendered 
operations in the Kingdom of Bahrain unfeasible. 
Consequently, during the financial year ended March 31, 
2023, the Company issued a notice of termination to the 
Ministry of Information Affairs (MOIA), Government of 
Bahrain, indicating its inability to continue services in the 
region, and the Company had also made an additional 
provision of ` 263.13 lakhs for an onerous contract.  
Following the constructive discussions and negotiations 
with MOIA, during the financial year under ended March 
31, 2024, the Company was granted a five-year license 
to operate an entertainment radio channel and the 
Company received a waiver of the previously mentioned 
onerous contract provision, resulting in a reversal of 
the amount of ` 263.13 lakhs. For a detailed explanation, 
please refer to Note 47 in both the standalone and 
consolidated financial statements.
 In March 2022, the Company made an additional 
investment of ` 268.18 lakhs for 132,552 equity shares 
of BHD 1 each. As at March 31, 2024, the process for 
increasing its paid-up share capital to 2,82,552 shares of 
BHD 1 each has been completed. As a result, the revised 
number of shares against the above investment are 
restated to 2,82,552 shares of BHD 1 each.
In April 2023, Hon’ble Madras High Court ruled on an 
appeal filed by Phonographic Performance Limited (PPL) 
against the 2% Net Advertisement Revenue (NAR) rate set 
by the Copyright Board for the period of ten years ending 
September 2020. The Hon’ble Madras High Court upheld 
the original rate but introduced a minimum floor rate of 
Rs. 660 per needle hour. The Company has filed a special 
leave petition with the Supreme Court, which has been 
converted into an appeal and will be heard in due course.
There is no proceeding pending under the Insolvency and 
Bankruptcy Code, 2016. There was no instance of one-
time settlement with any bank or financial institution.

MEDIA INDUSTRY STRUCTURE AND 
DEVELOPMENTS
Macroeconomic Scenario
Global Economy 
The Global economic growth showcased remarkable 
resilience in the financial years of 2023 and 2024, growing 
at a steady rate of 3.2%, as reported by the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF). This stability was influenced by 
several factors, including stringent monetary policies by 
major economies across the world aiming to controlling 
inflation, ongoing geopolitical tensions and a sluggish 
recovery of China. The impact of climate change became 
more pronounced, resulting in economic losses from 
severe weather conditions. Several measures undertaken 
by major economies to control inflation such as lower 
commodity prices, favourable supply conditions and 
stringent monetary policies decreased global inflation 
from 8.7% in FY 2022 to 6.8% in FY 2023.1
The projected outlook for the global economy suggests 
that it will maintain the same growth rate of 3.2% 
throughout FY 2024 and FY 2025. Advanced economies 
are expected to experience a modest uptick in growth, 
driven by a recovery within the eurozone, while emerging 
markets and developing economies are expected to 
maintain stable growth, albeit with regional disparities. 
Global inflation is expected to decline from 6.8% in 2023 
to 5.9% in 2024 and further to 4.5% in FY 2025. Major 
economies are likely to achieve their inflation targets 
sooner compared to the developing economies. Despite 
these stable projections, the ongoing adjustments in 
economic policies across the globe and the persistent 
challenges in key sectors suggest a cautious outlook for 
the near term.
Source: IMF WEO_ Apr 2024
Indian Economy
The Indian economy exhibited robust growth in FY 2024, 
with real GDP rising from 7.0% in FY 2023 to 8.2% in FY 
2024 with dynamic growth driven by advancements in 
both manufacturing and services sectors and bolstered 
by strong investment inflows and rising consumer 
demand. Inflation expected to decline, further supporting 
economic stability. Enhanced integration into global value 
chains is likely to boost exports, aided by improvements 
in the global trade environment. The upcoming year will 
benefit from expanded infrastructure spending, rising 
private sector investments, a strong service sector, and 
improved consumer confidence. This momentum is likely 
to strengthen in fiscal 2025 with better exports, higher 
manufacturing productivity, and increased agricultural 
output.

India’s rapid growth is supported by infrastructure 
investments and fiscal discipline, including a 17% rise 
in capital expenditure for FY2024. Stable interest rates 
should encourage private investment, while fiscal 
consolidation aims to reduce the deficit to 5.1% of GDP 
in FY2024 and 4.5% in FY2025. Despite a widening current 
account deficit due to higher imports, foreign direct 
investment is expected to rebound in FY2025, with goods 
exports recovering as global conditions improve.
Outlook
The prospects of the Indian economy are promising, 
supported by continued enhancement of macroeconomic 
fundamentals, robust financials, corporate sectors and a 
flexible external sector. The government’s emphasis on 
capital expenditure and fiscal discipline coupled with 
positive sentiment among consumers and businesses 
bodes well for investment and demand. The alleviation of 
supply chain pressures, widespread softening in inflation 
and early signs of an above-average southwest monsoon 
indicate a favourable inflation outlook for FY 2025.

Industry Overview
Global Advertisement Industry
According to Dentsu’s Global Ad Spend Forecasts, Global 
advertising spend is projected to grow by 5.0% in 2024, up from 
3.3% in 2023, projecting a total of $754.4 billion. This growth 
is fuelled by improving prospects in key markets including 
the UK, Germany, US, Japan, and France. Digital advertising is 
set to exceed previous growth expectations, with a 7.4% rise, 
capturing 59.6% of global spend. Notably, retail media and 
paid social are expected to see double-digit growth. The US 
presidential election is forecast to contribute significantly, 
accounting for around a third ($11 billion) of the additional ad 
spend in 2024.
In the top 12 markets, inflation-adjusted growth is expected 
to be 2.6% in 2024, with media inflation showing signs of 
easing but still high for TV and popular digital video formats 
like social video. Digital channels remain the fastest growing, 
with significant increases in retail media (+32.0%), paid social 
(+13.7%), and programmatic (+10.9%). Television, despite a slight 
contraction in its share of total spend to 22.5%, is expected to 
grow by 2.6% to $170.0 billion. This is driven by connected TV’s 
impressive 24.2% increase, which offsets a minor decline in 
broadcast television spend. Other media channels like out-
of-home, audio, and cinema are also expected to see growth, 
while print continues to decline.
Looking ahead, the outlook for global ad spends in 2024 is 
positive, with growth expected to match or outpace GDP 
progression in the top 12 markets. The US is predicted to be the

France (+4.0%) showing upward revisions. Travel and transport, 
benefiting from the post-pandemic rebound, and media and 
entertainment, driven by the proliferation of content and 
streaming services, are expected to be the fastest-growing 
industries. As the media landscape becomes increasingly 
digital and data-driven, there are vast opportunities for 
connecting people and brands, driving growth for businesses.

Indian Advertisement Industry
In 2023, Indian advertising grew by 7%, reaching INR 1.1 trillion, 
with digital advertising surpassing traditional media for the 
first time and accounting for 52% of total ad spend. Factors 
driving this shift include the rise of 5G, increasing per capita 
income, and a growing SME advertiser base. Despite this, 
traditional media such as print, radio, and cinema are also 
expected to see healthy growth. Advertising is forecasted to 
grow by 10% in 2024, reaching INR 1.25 trillion, and continue at 
a 9% CAGR until 2026, with digital media growing at 14% and 
traditional media at 5%. Key growth drivers include increasing 
per capita income, reducing income inequalities, rural growth, 
and a growing middle class. 
Segmental growth will be driven by factors such as the rise of 
5G; increased smartphone penetration; and active CTV homes 
for digital; and premium content for TV; access to educated 
audiences and event revenues for print; growth in digital OOH 
screens and transit media for OOH; mandated radio receivers 
in mobiles and SME advertising for radio; and a strong slate of 
theatrical releases for cinema. Digital media’s share of total 
ad spend is expected to reach 57% by 2026, with significant 
contributions from SME and long-tail digital advertising 
spends.

Management Discussion & Analysis
Corporate Overview
Statutory Reports
Financial Statements
Television
The television segment has experienced contrasting trends 
recently. Despite a decline in pay TV subscriptions, the total 
number of TV viewers is increasing. Although advertising 
revenue has decreased, the number of TV screens is rising, and 
the segment is expected to have a positive outlook. Growth in 
connected TV viewership will continue with the expansion of 
broadband and 5G. While the sector faces opportunities for 
growth, it will also contend with competition from social media, 
gaming, and short videos.
Television advertising is expected to grow at 3.6% CAGR to INR 
330 billion by 2026, boosted by news TV ad recovery, strong 
regional channel performance, increased sports investment, 
and rising per capita income. Risks include the lack of new 
revenue sources and competition from free digital platforms 
and social media. Subscription revenue is forecasted to reach 
INR 435 billion by 2026, growing at 2.9% CAGR, supported by 
increased TV households and low-cost options. Challenges 
include migration to connected TV platforms, LCO focus on 
broadband, and competition from OTT and social media. Total 
television revenue is projected to grow at 3.2% CAGR to INR 765 
billion by 2026, with potential changes after that.
Print
Print media is recovering post-COVID-19, with newspapers 
and magazines showing modest growth. The segment is 
expected to stabilise in readership over the next three years. 
To sustain this growth, opportunities lie in targeting specific 
audience segments, adopting innovative pricing strategies, and 
diversifying revenue streams.
The print media sector is forecasted to reach INR 288 billion 
by 2026, growing at 3.4% CAGR. Advertising will rise at 4.7% 
CAGR, while subscription revenue will grow slightly by 0.7% 
CAGR. Lower newsprint costs and increased events revenue 
will support growth. The sector must enhance home delivery, 
engage younger audiences, diversify revenue, and leverage 
first-party data to remain competitive.
Music Steaming Industry
In 2023, the Indian music industry saw continued strong 
engagement with audiences, particularly through streaming 
platforms, where film music remains the leading category. 
The market grew by 10%, reaching INR 24 billion, though this 
rate of growth was slower compared to previous years. This 
slowdown is partly due to a shift from free to paid services by 
some music OTT platforms, which has reduced the availability 
of free content. Despite this, film music continues to dominate 
with a 64% share of total consumption, though this represents 
a decline from around 80% three years ago. The rise of artist-
driven music, including popular genres like Punjabi music, now 
makes up 27% of consumption and is also gaining traction 
internationally.
Digital revenues, including income from streaming platforms, 
YouTube, short videos, social media, and telecom operators, 
grew by 9% in 2023 and account for 87% of the total music 
segment revenue. While the audience for music streaming 
reached 185 million, only 7.5 million were paid subscribers, 
an increase from 5 million subscribers the year before.  This 
number is expected to grow significantly, with projections 
suggesting the paid subscriber base could reach 15 million by 
2026 or 2027.
Looking ahead, the music industry is projected to grow at 
a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15%, potentially 
reaching INR 37 billion by 2026. This growth will be supported 
by an expanding smartphone user base, increased subscription 
video-on-demand (SVOD) services, higher concert revenues, 
and a rise in international consumption of Indian music. The 
paid subscriber base could grow to 35-40 million over the next 
five years.
Key Insight: Although free and ad-supported music models 
currently lead the market, the future of the industry lies in 
subscriptions. There is substantial growth potential in the paid 
subscriber base, which is expected to expand significantly in the 
coming years, signalling a shift towards greater monetization 
and consumer investment in music streaming services.

	
Private FM Broadcasters: There are 36 private FM 
broadcasters operating 388 FM radio stations across 113 
cities.
	
All India Radio: Prasar Bharati’s All India Radio operates 
479 stations broadcasting in 23 languages and 179 dialects. 
These stations cover approximately 92% of the country’s 
area and reach over 99% of the population.
	
Community Radio Stations: As of June 2023, there are 
446 operational community radio stations, marking an 
increase from 366 stations in the previous year.
Regulatory Initiatives
Advertisement Rates 
In September 2023, the government approved a significant 
43% increase in base rates for advertisements on private FM 
radio stations. This adjustment is particularly noteworthy as it 
is the first rate revision in eight years, the previous one being 
between December 2015 and March 2023. 
TRAI Recommendations
The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has put forth 
several recommendations aimed at revitalizing the FM radio 
sector:
	
Broadcasting News and Current Affairs: TRAI has 
recommended allowing private FM radio operators to 
broadcast news and current affairs programs, limited to 
10 minutes per hour. This move is expected to enhance 
content diversity and attract a wider audience.
	
License Fee Structure: A proposal has been made to 
remove the non-refundable one-time entry fee (NOTEF) 
and extend the FM license period by three years. 
Additionally, TRAI has suggested calculating the annual 
license fee as 4% of the Gross Revenue (excluding GST), 
delinking it from the NOTEF. This is anticipated to reduce 
the financial burden on broadcasters and encourage new 
entrants into the market.
	
FM 
Receivers 
in 
Smartphones: 
TRAI 
recommends 
mandating the availability of FM receivers on all mobile 
handsets, including smartphones. Ensuring that FM radio 
functionality is enabled and not disabled in devices will 
significantly increase the medium’s reach, especially 
among younger demographics who predominantly use 
smartphones for media consumption.
Advertising Trends
Ad Volume Growth
The year 2023 witnessed a robust 19% increase in radio ad 
volumes compared to 2022. The advertising landscape featured:
	
Categories and Advertisers: A diverse range of 426 
categories with over 10,000 advertisers and 13,615 brands 
utilized radio for advertising. Notably, 4,400 advertisers 
were new to radio, having no presence on TV, print, or 
digital platforms.
	
Ad Rates: Despite the increase in volume, ad rates 
experienced an average decline of 8%. This reduction is 
attributed to the high volume of ads and lower yields, 
particularly prevalent in smaller towns.
Retail Advertising Surge
The share of retail and local advertisers increased by 28%, 
driven by:
	
Retail Segment Recovery: The post-pandemic recovery 
of the retail sector has spurred increased advertising 
activities.
	
Digital Advertising Costs: Escalating costs of city-centric 
digital advertising have made radio a more attractive 
medium for local businesses.
	
National Advertisers: While the share of national 
advertisers decreased, their ad volumes still grew by 10%. 
The top spending categories included services, retail, and 
automotive sectors, collectively accounting for 51% of the 
total ad spend.
Non-FCT Revenues
Non-Fixed Commercial Time (Non-FCT) revenues have become 
a significant contributor to the overall earnings of large radio 
companies, accounting for 20-25% of total revenue. Key drivers 
of Non-FCT revenues include:
	
Event Intellectual Properties (IPs): Hosting and sponsorship 
of events have emerged as lucrative revenue streams.
	
Brand Activation: Engaging consumers through experiential 
marketing campaigns has gained traction.
	
International Music Streaming: Diversifying into music 
streaming services has opened new avenues for 
monetization.
	
Digital Marketing: Leveraging digital platforms for 
advertising and promotions has complemented traditional 
radio broadcasting revenues.
Key Challenges
Measurement Limitations
The current measurement of radio listenership is confined 
to a limited number of cities, which hampers the ability of 
broadcasters to effectively demonstrate their reach and 
audience engagement levels to potential advertisers. This 
limitation poses a significant challenge in attracting substantial 
advertising investments, especially from national advertisers 
seeking wide coverage.
Smartphone Integration Issues
A considerable number of high-end smartphones are not 
equipped with FM radio receivers, which restricts the medium’s 
accessibility and reach. Without regulatory mandates to 
include FM functionality in all smartphones, radio broadcasters 
risk losing potential audiences who primarily consume media 
through mobile devices.

Digital Radio Implementation
The absence of a clear and comprehensive roadmap for the 
implementation of digital radio poses a significant hurdle. 
Ensuring a transition to digital formats that protect the interests 
of all stakeholders, including broadcasters, advertisers, and 
listeners, is essential for the future sustainability and growth 
of the industry.
Pending License Fee Reforms
Despite TRAI’s recommendation for an annual license fee of 4% 
of gross revenue (excluding GST), this reform has not yet been 
implemented. The delay in adopting this recommendation 
continues to place a financial strain on broadcasters, especially 
smaller players struggling with profitability.
Authorization for News Broadcasting
The radio industry is still awaiting final approval to broadcast 
news and current affairs programs for 10 minutes each hour. 
Granting this authorization would align radio with other media 
platforms and enhance its content offerings, thereby attracting 
a broader audience base.
Outlook
The radio industry is poised for steady growth, with revenues 
projected to reach INR 27 billion by 2026. Several factors are 
expected to drive this growth:
	
Increased SME and Retail Advertising: Small and medium-
sized enterprises (SMEs) and retail businesses are 
anticipated to increase their advertising spend on radio, 
leveraging its cost-effectiveness and local reach.
	
New Brand Launches: The introduction of new products 
and 
services 
will 
create 
additional 
advertising 
opportunities for radio broadcasters.
	
Non-FCT Revenue Opportunities: Expansion into event 
IPs, digital marketing, and international music streaming 
will continue to bolster Non-FCT revenues, expected to 
comprise 25% of total revenue by 2026.
	
Government Advertising: The increased Directorate 
of Advertising and Visual Publicity (DAVP) rates for 
government ads will benefit the sector, particularly in the 
context of upcoming elections.
	
Regional Content and Influencer Marketing: Radio’s 
focus on creating regional content and leveraging local 
influencers will enhance engagement and open new 
revenue streams.
Despite these positive indicators, the industry must address 
ongoing challenges such as rate recovery and the development 
of effective measurement metrics to attract and retain national 
advertisers.

Important Legal Developments in FM Radio Industry in 
FY2024
There are several significant legal developments unfolded 
in the radio industry: 
Statutory Licensing (SL) for Music and connected 
Litigations:
In December 2020, private FM broadcasters secured a 
favorable music royalty rate through the provisions of 
Section 31D (Statutory Licensing - SL) of the Copyright 
Act. This development played a crucial role in curbing the 
monopolistic practices of music labels and significantly 
reduced the royalty payment burden on broadcasters. 
The initial order from the Intellectual Property Appellate 
Board (IPAB) was valid for one year, expiring on September 
30th, 2021. As the expiration approached, broadcasters 
filed an application in the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in 
September 2021 to extend these rates. They successfully 
secured the continuation of the existing rates until the 
court establishes new SL rates. These proceedings are 
currently pending and are expected to be addressed in 
the coming year.
The music labels, dissatisfied with the SL rates, have 
exerted considerable effort to prevent FM broadcasters 
from benefiting from these rates. Several labels have 
filed appeals challenging the fairness of the SL rates, 
but they have yet to obtain any relief. Additionally, labels 
have pursued infringement claims against broadcasters 
by focusing on the technicalities of Rule 29(4) under 
the Copyright Rules 2013. They argue that broadcasters 
are not adhering to the procedures outlined in the rule, 
procedures that are widely recognized as burdensome 
and, in some cases, impractical if interpreted strictly. 
Despite these challenges, the FM industry has managed 
to ensure uninterrupted music broadcasts.
To overcome these legal obstacles, FM broadcasters filed 
writ petitions in the Hon’ble Madras and Hon’ble Bombay 
High Courts, challenging both the constitutionality and 
the interpretation of the Copyright Rules. While the 
Hon’ble Madras High Court upheld the constitutionality of 
Rule 29(4) and made some conflicting observations, the 
134
Management Discussion & Analysis
Entertainment Network (India) Limited
industry remains determined to pursue this matter to the 
Hon’ble Supreme Court. A Special Leave Petition against 
the Madras High Court’s decision has been admitted 
by the Hon’ble Supreme Court, and a detailed hearing 
is expected in the coming months. These proceedings 
are anticipated to bring much-needed clarity and help 
avoid further roadblocks in the smooth exercise of 
broadcasters’ statutory licensing rights.
In the meanwhile, in a big relief for the FM broadcasters, a 
single bench of Delhi High Court has recently held in one 
of the suits filed by music labels, that the new statutory 
notice formats adopted by the FM Radio broadcasters 
are in compliance with the requirements of the Copyright 
Rules 2013 and as such there is no threat of any 
injunctions to be brought on operation of any FM broad 
henceforth. This is development will in all probabilities 
end the hurdle in exercise of Statutory License rights for 
FM Radio Broadcasters.
161st Parliamentary Standing Committee Report – (Dated 
20th July 2021)
The Committee submitted its report on the topic of 
‘Review of the Intellectual Property Rights Regime in 
India’ and inter-alia recommended that DPIIT should 
amend Section 31D of Copyrights Act for including 
‘internet or digital broadcasters’ under the purview of 
Statutory License. DPIIT subsequently invited suggestions 
from stakeholders on the above recommendation. 
The FM Broadcasters have submitted their respective 
written submissions to the DPIIT on 28th September 2021 
supporting the same.
3.	
Important regulatory matters concerning the radio 
industry
TRAI Recommendations on Consultation Paper on ‘Issues 
relating to FM Radio Broadcasting’:
To deliberate on the issues referred to by Ministry of 
Information and Broadcasting (MIB) and concerns raised 
by Association of Radio Operators of India (AROI), the 
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) had issued 
a Consultation Paper (CP) on ‘Issues related to FM Radio 
Broadcasting’ on 9th February 2023. Extensive written 
comments and counter comments on the CP were given 
by radio broadcasters including our Company (ENIL)
on 9th March 2023 and 23rd March 2023 respectively. 
Subsequently, an Open House Discussion was held 
through video conferencing mode on 26th April 2023 in 
which the Company participated and advocated its views 
on the CP.
Consequently, after detailed study of the representation 
of the industry, TRAI published its recommendations on 
the CP to MIB on September 05, 2023. 
In a big win for the industry, TRAI concurred with FM 
industry’s concerns and made some very important 
recommendations in favour of the radio industry, a gist 
of which is as follows:
	
TRAI recommended that the annual license fee 
of a FM radio channel should be de-linked from 
Non-Refundable One Time Entry Fee (NOTEF). The 
license fee should be calculated as 4% of the Gross 
Revenue (GR) of the FM radio channel during the 
respective financial year. GST should be excluded 
from Gross Revenue (GR). This recommendation 
when implemented, will have a huge positive impact 
on revenues of radio operators. 
	
TRAI recommended that the Government may take 
appropriate measures to provide relief to the FM 
radio operators to address challenges posed due to 
COVID-19 pandemic. 
	
TRAI recommended that Private FM Radio Operators 
should be allowed to broadcast news and current 
affairs programs.
	
Mandatory availability of FM receivers on all mobile 
handsets including Smartphones: Functions or 
features pertaining to FM radio should remain 
enabled and activated on all mobile handsets 
having the necessary hardware. Built-in FM radio 
receiver in mobile handset must not be subjected 
to any form of disablement or deactivation. This 
recommendation if implemented, will result in 
larger audience reach for FM radio amongst the 
people using smartphones, which is increasing 
by each passing day, and people will no longer be 
dependent on their car receivers to listen FM radio. 
This is also expected to translate in increase in ad-
revenues. Also, more importantly this move will also 
help the efforts of National Disaster Management 
Authority (NDMA) to reach maximum people for help 
in case of a natural disaster, since FM broadcast 
as known to be most robust and reliable means of 
communication in such situations and sustain even 
when other mediums like internet and TV networks 
fail. This was duly appreciated by TRAI and NDMA in 
its respective recommendations and accordingly an 
advisory to this effect was also published by MeITY 
on its website, advising all mobiles manufacturers 
to ensure availability of FM receivers on all type of 
mobile handsets in India.
A Standing Committee, headed by a senior officer of Joint 
Secretary or above level, is recommended by TRAI to 
oversee and monitor the compliance of enabling the FM 
Radio in Mobile Handsets.

Radio broadcasters adjust to the digital boom
Most 
radio

begun 
integrating 
digital products into their revenue portfolios. Many 
of these broadcasters feature local radio jockeys who 
are prominent personalities in their respective cities,

often boasting substantial followings on social media 
platforms. Radio stations themselves maintain active 
social media pages. As advertisers increasingly allocate 
budgets to digital platforms, radio broadcasters have 
adapted by including their RJs’ social media pages in 
their advertising proposals. 
Major radio broadcasters have a significant following 
on their national Facebook and Instagram pages. 
Additionally, each company maintains a substantial 
subscriber base on their You Tube channels. ENIL alone 
boasts 27.1 million followers on its national Facebook 
pages, 14.2 million followers on its national Instagram 
pages, and has 19.9 million subscribers on YouTube 
across its various channels.
5.	
Taxation of Live and Non-live Broadcasting Content
In recent judgments, the Delhi High Court determined 
that broadcasting rights for “live events” do not qualify 
as “copyright” under Indian copyright law. Consequently, 
payments for such rights cannot be classified as royalty 
under Indian income-tax law. Additionally, regarding 
the division of payments between “live” and “non-live” 
fees, the Court noted that if contracting parties clearly 
specify and agree to separate fees, and payments are 
made accordingly under distinct categories, such division 
cannot be deemed unjustified or arbitrary. The Court thus 
upheld a fee split of 95% for “live” transmission and 5% 
for “non-live” transmission as agreed upon by the parties 
in their contract. This ruling could impact media rights 
agreements involving sports bodies and commercial 
rights holders, particularly where contractual terms do 
not separately distinguish between payments for “live” 
and “non-live” rights2.

Radio Shines as Media Industry Faces Challenges 
In FY24, the media sector faced substantial challenges due 
to global macroeconomic conditions, which affected both 
revenue and margins across various media segments. 
Television and print media displayed underwhelming 
performance throughout the year. However, the radio 
industry emerged as a notable exception, showcasing 
exceptional resilience and growth. The company 
capitalised on this trend, starting the fiscal year with a 
significant boost in profitability. Although there was a 
slight decline in revenue, primarily attributed to the lack 
of major TV properties and a strategic pivot towards more 
profitable events, the Company successfully enhanced 
its EBITDA and margins through stringent cost-saving 
measures.

Management Discussion & Analysis
Entertainment Network (India) Limited
Overall FY24 was a good year for the radio industry, which 
picked up strength steadily during the year. Throughout 
the year, Radio outshined the other media mediums, 
which faced a challenging environment. Pricing for the 
industry has bottomed up and there are early signs of 
green shoot visible, which can further pick up during 
upcoming festival season. On the other hand, volumes 
have been quite strong during the year, and picked up 
further towards the end on account of higher government 
spending on the back of general elections. Government 
and Political category is expected to remain strong on 
the back of upcoming state-level elections. However, 
overall, the business is turned more towards the retail 
segment as compared to big corporates, which is true to 
the nature of the radio medium. Within that, real estate, 
BSFI, education and auto are few of the sectors which are 
doing well.
Volumes have already crossed the pre-Covid levels 
leading to improved utilisation levels. Along with the 
demand and consumption sentiments, higher utilisation 
is also one of the pre-cursors for the improvement in the 
pricing. 
The radio segment, a significant part of our business, 
exhibited outstanding growth with a revenue increase of 
10.8% during FY24, led by strong volumes growth. Radio 
industry as a whole saw strong uptick in volume growth 
however, as a market leader we were at the front end 
of this momentum. We clocked volume growth of 15.5% 
during FY24. Volumes have crossed the pre-Covid levels, 
leading to improvement in utilisation levels. This has 
helped in restricting the downfall in prices, which have 
stabilised during the year. 
Non-FCT business had a roller coaster ride during FY24. 
The H1 is seasonally weaker period for the solutions 
business as compared to H2. The same phenomena 
were witnessed in FY24 as well. The start of the year was 
comparatively weak for the segment however it picked up 
pace in the second half of the year. Overall, we witnessed 
a growth of 8% in non-FCT revenues. 
Improved 
overall 
performance 
led 
to 
improved 
profitability. 
During the year, we acquired the business of Gaana, 
which gave further wings to focused digital segment. We 
have now become a complete entertainment company 
in terms of audio streaming platform. We have already 
started the process of integrating our own Mirchi Plus 
platform with Gaana and are seeing encouraging early 
signs of adoption. 
3.	
EBITDA Expansion: Encouraging Improvement 
We have restated our past numbers on account of IND 
AS 103, to incorporate results from the earliest period 
of the acquired business. Led by higher revenues, 
and maintaining efficiency in costs, we were able to 
report robust improvement in our profitability. While 
the journey to regain our pre-pandemic EBITDA levels 
remains ongoing, we are steadfast in our pursuit of 
continued growth, enhanced efficiency, and sustained 
profitability. Without Digital Platform, our EBITDA moved 
to INR 125.4 Cr in FY24. Consequently, we have witnessed 
improvement in our profitability and registered margins 
of ~27.6% during FY24. 
The Company maintained solid profitability, with PAT 
rising to INR 50.6 crores for the fiscal year, highlighting a 
substantial improvement from the previous year. 
Our strategy for solutions business focuses on prioritizing 
profitability by concentrating solely on events that are 
lucrative, even if it means foregoing significant revenue 
opportunities like the Mirchi Music Awards. This approach 
led to the absence of major TV properties, impacting 
revenues, but it ensures long-term profitability and 
improving margins. 
With a strategic focus on optimizing operational 
performance, we are confident in our ability to navigate 
challenges and drive the organization towards even 
greater success in the coming years.
4.	
Radio witnessed healthy volume growth
Our core sector witnessed healthy growth during FY24, 
on the account of strong volumes throughout the year. 
The segment grew by 10.8% YoY in FY24. Volumes grew by 
16.4% and have surpassed pre-Covid levels. The overall 
radio industry grew by 17.4% in FY24.
We continued to enjoy the market leadership enjoy and 
gained further marker share in FY24., which now stands 
at 24.0% vs 25.9% in FY23.
Led by strong volume growth, we have been able to 
improve our utilisation rates as well which now stands at 
80.6% at the end of FY24. 
Pricing has remained steady during the year. We 
have witnessed early signs of shoot and believe that 
the declining phase is now over. We expect marginal 
improvement in pricing in 2HFY25 at the time of festivals. 
5.	
Digital and Investment Strategy
Throughout FY24, the digital segment played a pivotal role 
in the Company’s strategic evolution. Digital revenues 
saw notable growth, rising from 9.7% of FCT revenues in 
Q2 to 15.3% in Q4, following the acquisition of Gaana. The 
Company invested significantly in its digital initiatives, 
including an additional INR 6.4 crores in Gaana, which 
demonstrated strong growth across various metrics.

ENIL’s international business
North America
ENIL launched its first station in the US on India’s 
Republic Day, Jan 26th, 2019, in the tri-state area of 
New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut via a brand 
licensing arrangement with a local partner, using HD 
radio technology. Due to challenges encountered in 
HD technology and effectiveness to attract advertisers 
across several cities in the US, we decided to call off this 
arrangement in FY2021 except for New Jersey.
In July 2021, we explored opportunity in another city of 
US and launched station in San Francisco, followed by the 
launch of the Dallas station in April 2022. In January 2023, 
we made the deliberate decision to exit San Francisco 
due to revenue shortfalls, which were directly attributed 
to persistent transmission issues that our partner was 
unwilling to resolve.
As on March 2024, our presence in US is with initially 
launched terrestrial station of New Jersey frequency and 
two online stations US – Mirchi Telugu & New York Online 
catering to South Asian radio in US.
ENIL introduced the Mirchi Plus app in mid-February 2022, 
marking a significant expansion of its digital presence. 
The app is readily accessible for users on both Apple and 
Android platforms, making it easy to download and use 
across the USA and Canada. In Canada, ENIL recognized 
the demand for Punjabi content and launched a dedicated 
online station, “Yo Punjabi,” which has quickly become 
the leading station for Punjabi-speaking audiences in 
the region. Moreover, the accessibility of ENIL’s content 
extends beyond mobile devices. US-based listeners 
can also enjoy ENIL’s stations through Amazon Alexa, 
allowing for a seamless listening experience through 
voice-activated smart speakers. This multi-platform 
availability reflects ENIL’s commitment to reaching its 
audience wherever they are, providing a mix of music, 
entertainment, and cultural content that resonates with 
the South Asian community across North America
UAE
Radio Mirchi was launched in the UAE in January 2012 
through a brand licensing agreement with Abu Dhabi 
Media Corporation (ADMC). Over the years, it became a 
favourite among listeners, being repeatedly voted UAE’s 
most loved Hindi Station in the Masala Awards. In terms 
of listenership, ENIL outperformed other stations across 
the UAE, regardless of language—be it Arabic, Hindi, 
English, Malayalam, or others.
However, the brand licensing and content agreements 
with ADMC were terminated in June 2020. In March 2021, 
Radio Mirchi made a comeback in the UAE market, this 
time in partnership with Dolphin Recording Studio. The 
collaboration led to a significant transformation, as the 
former Suno FM was rebranded into the new Mirchi 102.4 
FM. This strategic move allowed ENIL to reestablish its 
presence and continue its legacy in the UAE.
In FY23, ENIL significantly ramped up its involvement in 
events and activations, which had been limited in FY22 due 
to the pandemic. Key initiatives include Mirchi Terminal 
and Mirchi Jam—the latter being a talent hunt aimed at 
colleges and schools. These initiatives are designed to 
engage listeners more deeply and are expected to further 
enhance Mirchi’s listenership by tapping into local talent 
and creating vibrant community events
The launch of the Mirchi Plus app in the UAE in mid-
February 2022 marked a significant expansion of ENIL’s 
digital offerings in the region. The app has been met with 
a positive response, reflecting the strong brand presence 
and loyal listener base that ENIL has cultivated over the 
years in the UAE.
The Mirchi Plus app provides users with a comprehensive 
entertainment experience. In addition to streaming 
Mirchi UAE, the app features 12 local stations from 
various regions of India, catering to the diverse tastes of 
the South Asian diaspora in the UAE.
Moreover, for those who prefer online listening, Mirchi 
UAE is accessible via the web at www.mirchi.ae, ensuring 
that the station is easily available to a broad audience 
across multiple platforms. This strategic move reinforces 
ENIL’s commitment to being accessible to its audience 
in as many ways as possible, solidifying its position as a 
leading entertainment brand in the UAE.
Bahrain 
ENIL made its debut in Bahrain with a local partner (Adline 
Media Network), under brand licensing arrangement after 
September 2019 our partner decided to surrender the 
license. ENIL secured license in June 2020 after making 
a bid with Ministry of Information Affairs (MIA), Kingdom 
of Bahrain. 
On May 9th, 2021, through a 100% owned subsidiary 
called Mirchi Bahrain WLL, we relaunched Brand Mirchi 
in Bahrain. We have been increasing our business in 
radio through high-margin activation business, client 
response and audience feedback has been very good. It 
is to be noted that ENIL is the only private station (across 
languages and formats) in Bahrain.
In July 2023 MIA conducted auction for Operation of Indian 
Entertainment Radio FM Channel, Kingdom of Bahrain. 
ENIL participated and won the bid with revised license 
fees as quoted in auction to operate the FM channel for 
a period of five years till December 2028.ENIL has now 
become the exclusive private FM channel catering to

Bollywood and South Asian content within the Kingdom 
of Bahrain. 
The Mirchi Plus app was also launched in Bahrain in mid-
February 2022 and has garnered a positive reception from 
listeners. Additionally, Mirchi Bahrain is accessible online 
at www.mirchi.in/radio/bahrain, offering a convenient 
way for audiences in Bahrain to enjoy ENIL’s content.
Qatar 
ENIL, Global Entertainment Network Limited (GENL), 
Marhaba FM, and Mr. Salem Fahad S E Al-Naemi entered 
in shareholder arrangement to operate a radio station in 
Doha, Qatar. In March 2021, ENIL invested in GENL which 
resulted 49% stake in the Company. As a result of this 
investment, ENIL is entitled to 75% of the distributable 
profits. 
GENL is operating business in Doha in accordance with 
the terms and conditions set out in the Agreement. In 
March 2021, the station’s launch was marked by a highly 
positive reception from both listeners and advertisers, 
demonstrating its successful entry into the market and 
the strong appeal it has generated among its target 
audience under the brand name “MirchiOne” as per the 
terms and conditions agreed between GENL and Marhaba 
FM. 
In the past three years, Mirchi One has become the top 
choice for both listeners and advertisers in Qatar, with 
rapid business growth. We are leaders in radio revenue 
and have developed a strong activation business with 
multiple established IPs in the market.
The Mirchi Plus app was also launched in Qatar in mid-
February 2022 and has been warmly received by listeners. 
Mirchi Qatar is accessible online at www.mirchi.in/radio/
qatar, providing a convenient platform for the audience 
in Qatar to enjoy Mirchi’s content. 
Future expansion into other countries
With the growing trend of consumers shifting towards 
digital platforms for audio content, ENIL’s strategy for 
international expansion is increasingly focused on digital 
avenues. This transition opens substantial opportunities 
for Brand Mirchi, particularly in advertising and 
subscription models. The potential to capture a larger 
audience and generate revenue through these digital 
channels in international markets is substantial and 
holds significant promise for the brand’s global growth.
In March 2024, the Board of Directors approved the 
acquisition of up to a 50% equity stake in Ninety-nine 
Audiovisual Media Production LLC, a Saudi Arabia-based 
company, by investing up to five million Saudi Riyal (SAR). 
The completion of this transaction is contingent upon 
meeting certain conditions precedent and obtaining any 
necessary regulatory approvals.

HR Initiatives:
In FY24, one of the biggest accolades received was 
Great Place to Work (GPTW) certification for ENIL. The 
Certification validated our belief in people practices and 
culture of ENIL.
Investment in People Development: 
This year apart from regular training and development 
initiatives we focused on developing our middle 
management leadership. We designed and conducted 
Development Centre based on the identified competencies. 
This was followed by finalizing development plans for 
each individual. This helped focusing on development of 
people at leadership position and also on their career 
goals.
We conducted online and classroom trainings to upskill 
people. We also kept emphasis on online learning via our 
learning app ‘Mirchi classroom’ – by launching Massive 
Open Online Courses (MOOC) learning via which we 
enabled consumption of many courses for a large set 
of employees. This benefited in gaining knowledge on 
various topics. Apart from MOOC learning, regular online 
induction programs or webinars, facilitated by in-house 
subject matter experts were conducted. Around 70% of 
our people were trained via in-person and online training. 
To improve personal effectiveness, we have a yearly 
feedback mechanism that helps managers reflect on their 
work styles and ways to improve working relationships 
with teams. The feedback results are followed by 
workshops where improvement areas and action points 
are decided. 
We have an AI BOT called ‘Amber’, which reaches out 
to our people at regular intervals. These conversations 
with Amber give us a complete view on matters such as 
organization, culture, career progression, learning, and 
job satisfaction. These conversations help us reflect and 
design better people practices and processes. For the 
year FY24, our NPS scores were in the range of 85%.
Our People and their Growth: As a philosophy, we have 
always looked at internal talent first for any career and job 
opportunities that come up. We have a defined promotion 
policy & in combination with our robust performance 
management practices, we promote around 15% of our 
workforce every year. Regular career conversations & 
structured 3rd party led development centers along 
with various other data points of experience, and past 
performance are collated to plan for succession into key 
roles & also for grooming promising middle managers for 
bigger roles in the Company.

RISKS, CONCERNS AND CHALLENGES FACING THE 
COMPANY
Market Risk: 
The Media and Entertainment industry, particularly 
radio, operates with high operating leverage due to its 
significant fixed costs. While costs can be reduced, doing 
so requires considerable time and effort. During an 
economic downturn, radio companies are among the first 
to be impacted, as their revenues decline rapidly while 
costs decrease more gradually. In contrast, newspaper 
companies can quickly reduce costs by cutting the 
number of pages, lowering paper quality, and printing 
fewer copies, while TV companies can reduce costs by 
scaling back show production. On the upside, when the 
economy recovers, radio companies experience profit 
growth more quickly than other media. To mitigate such 
market risks, ENIL implemented various cost-cutting 
initiatives during the pandemic, which enabled a swift 
improvement in its EBITDA levels.
Slowdown in the Radio Industry:
The traditional media industry, including radio, is facing 
significant challenges due to digital disruption. In the 
developed world, the newspaper industry has been 
heavily impacted, but radio and TV have shown more 
resilience. In India, although the TV industry has been 
resilient, it is gradually losing viewers to digital OTT 
platforms. A similar trend is emerging in radio. Many 
mobile phones, particularly high-end models, are being 
released without FM tuners, forcing users to rely on OTT

apps for music consumption, making it difficult for radio 
companies to target younger audiences. However, the 
increasing penetration of cars and traffic congestion has 
led to higher radio consumption in vehicles. Although 
digital products have entered the car segment, their 
penetration remains low. FM radio, on the other hand, 
has a natural advantage by offering infotainment, 
companionship through RJs, and ease of use.
Declining Listenership:
Radio broadcasters, in an attempt to offset the reduction 
in effective rates, are airing more advertisements, which 
has deteriorated the listener experience. If this trend is 
not addressed promptly, it could further drive listeners 
to digital platforms.
Dependency on Music Labels: 
We took control of Gaana’s operations on December 
1, 2023, and this has become a key focus area for the 
business moving forward. The success of this venture 
hinges on maintaining a strong music library and achieving 
a profitable Average Revenue Per User (ARPU). Content 
is a significant cost, accounting for approximately 70% 
of revenue. Controlling these costs will be challenging 
and will depend on securing long-term, sustainable 
agreements with music labels.
Operational and Financial Risk: The Company’s Risk 
Management Framework is regularly reviewed by the 
Board, with new risks being added as necessary. The 
management identified the pandemic as a black swan 
event that disrupted our business. As a strategic response 
to better handle future black swan events, the Company 
has decided to accelerate its transformation toward a 
digital-first approach. Nonetheless, the Company remains 
vulnerable to other unforeseen black swan events.

SEGMENT- WISE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Management Discussion and Analysis of the Company’s 
operations together with the discussion on financial 
performance with respect to operational performance 
should be read in conjunction with the financial 
statements and the related notes.
1)	
ENIL
In FY 2024, there were promising signs of recovery 
from the impacts of previous economic challenges; 
however, the progress towards fully capitalizing on 
this recovery was hindered by various disruptions 
such as geopolitical tensions and high inflation, 
which affected economies globally. While revenues 
rebounded during the year, driven primarily by 
increased volumes that surpassed previous levels, 
pricing remained subdued. The combination of 
geopolitical tensions and inflationary pressures 
constrained pricing, making it difficult for businesses 
to fully restore their revenue levels. Despite 
these obstacles, the overall economic recovery 
demonstrated positive momentum. 
Radio Segment
The overall business was primarily driven by radio ad 
volumes and contributions from the digital segment. 
Excluding the digital platform, revenues grew by 
10% in FY2024, reaching ` 453.7 crores, while EBITDA 
increased by 34.5% to ` 125.4 crores. Profit before

INTEGRATED REPORTING:
Integrated reporting provides a comprehensive view of both 
the financial and non-financial performance of Entertainment 
Network (India) Limited (‘the Company’/ ‘ENIL’). This approach 
highlights not only the Company’s economic results but also 
its social, environmental, and governance (ESG) activities, 
offering stakeholders a more complete understanding of how 
ENIL creates value over time. By integrating these aspects, 
ENIL demonstrates how sustainability and long-term strategy 
are deeply woven into its operations.
The Integrated Report for the financial year ending March 31, 
2024, is an essential part of the Management Discussion & 
Analysis (MD&A) report. This report primarily focuses on ENIL’s 
business model, illustrating how it creates, maintains, and 
enhances value across its various ventures, while remaining 
adaptable in an evolving market landscape.
About the Purpose of Business and Business Model
1.	
Purpose of the Business:
ENIL is a dominant player in India’s music and 
entertainment sector, spearheading innovation and 
engagement through a diversified portfolio of media 
brands. ENIL operates a robust network of FM Radio 
channels, including Radio Mirchi, Mirchi 95, Mirchi 
Love, and Kool FM, which have become household 
names across various regions. In tandem, ENIL’s music 
streaming platform, Gaana, offers a cutting-edge digital 
experience, providing on-demand music to millions of 
users worldwide. ENIL produces high-quality content 
spanning audio, video, and live events, delivered across 
multiple platforms—from traditional radio and television 
to digital streams and social media channels.
This extensive multi-channel approach ensures ENIL’s 
content reaches diverse audiences across geographical 
boundaries, 
with 
a 
significant 
global 
presence, 
particularly in markets where the diaspora seeks Indian 
content. The core purpose of ENIL is to entertain, inform, 
and engage its audience while driving long-term value for 
stakeholders through innovative content and experiences 
that cater to changing consumer preferences.
2.	
Business Model:
ENIL’s business model revolves around monetizing 
its broad and engaged audience base, which includes 
listeners, viewers, readers, and event participants. 
Revenue streams are diversified across several core 
areas:
	
FM Radio Advertising: ENIL’s extensive network 
of radio stations provides prime opportunities 
for advertisers to reach mass audiences. This 
remains the company’s primary source of revenue, 
contributing about 61% of total income. Advertisers 
value the broad reach and deep local penetration 
that ENIL’s radio channels offer.
	
Digital Content Sponsorship and Licensing: ENIL 
capitalizes on its premium video content by 
securing sponsorships for distribution across 
digital and traditional media platforms. These 
include partnerships with television networks, OTT 
platforms like YouTube, and social media sites such 
as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Additionally, 
ENIL licenses limited rights to its content to third-
party platforms, generating supplementary revenue 
from web series and other multimedia productions.
	
Music Streaming Subscription: Gaana, ENIL’s music 
streaming service, operates on a subscription-based 
model. Users are offered an ad-free experience in 
exchange for a monthly or annual fee, generating a 
stable revenue stream independent of advertising.
This diversified business model allows ENIL to be agile 
in response to market shifts and consumer behaviour, 
ensuring sustained growth across both traditional and 
digital platforms.
3.	
Resources required to operate:
Operating a complex media conglomerate like ENIL 
necessitates a broad spectrum of resources. Foremost 
among these are financial resources, which are essential 
for acquiring FM frequencies through competitive 
government auctions, a process that requires substantial 
upfront investments. Beyond radio, ENIL continually 
invests in state-of-the-art studios, transmission facilities, 
cloud infrastructure, and digital platforms to ensure 
seamless operations across its media channels.
Equally vital is ENIL’s human capital, consisting of 
a highly skilled workforce that includes creative 
professionals responsible for producing compelling 
content, as well as sales and marketing teams focused on 
converting audience engagement into revenue. ENIL also 
relies heavily on support staff in logistics, finance, legal 
services, and strategy, who ensure operational efficiency 
and regulatory compliance.
4.	
Key Inputs:
The successful execution of ENIL’s business model 
depends on several critical inputs:
	
Financial 
Capital: 
Necessary 
for 
securing 
radio frequencies, establishing and upgrading 
infrastructure, and maintaining working capital.
	
Human Capital: Essential for content creation, 
business development, and operational success.

properties bolster ENIL’s market presence and provide 
additional revenue streams through brand partnerships,

Key audit matter
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
The subsidiaries have incurred losses in the current year 
and the carrying value of such investments exceed the 
net worth of the respective subsidiaries,  Considering the 
existence of aforesaid impairment indicators in the current 
year, the Company has assessed the recoverable amounts 
of each investment when impairment indicators exist 
by comparing the fair value (less costs of disposal) and 
carrying amount of that investment as on the reporting 
date in accordance with Ind AS 36, Impairment of assets. 
The management estimate of the recoverable amounts of 
the identified investments has been determined through 
discounted cash flow model with the help of a management 
expert. Such valuation method requires significant 
judgment in carrying out the impairment assessment and 
the key assumptions included estimates around business 
and cash flow projections of future cash flows, growth 
rates, discount rates, estimated future operating and 
capital expenditure amongst others. Changes to these 
assumptions could lead to material changes in estimated 
recoverable amounts, resulting in impairment.
Based on the aforesaid assessment the Company has 
recorded impairment charge, as mentioned in Note 47 (a) 
and (b) to the standalone financial statements, during the 
year ended 31 March 2024 as the recoverable amount is 
higher than the carrying value. 
Considering the materiality of the carrying amounts, 
the inherent subjectivity, complexity and significance of 
judgment involved, impairment assessment of aforesaid 
investments, we  have considered it to be a key audit 
matter for the current year’s audit.
	
Involved auditor’s experts to assess the appropriateness of 
the valuation methodologies used by the management and 
reviewed the appropriateness of key valuation assumptions 
including the estimates around business and cash flow 
projections, growth rates, discount rates estimated future 
operating and capital expenditure amongst others used 
within the discounted cash flow model.
	
Evaluated and challenged management’s assumptions such 
as implied growth rates during explicit period and discount 
rate for their reasonableness based on our understanding 
of the business of the respective subsidiary companies, 
past results and external factors such as industry trends 
and forecasts. 
	
Obtained and evaluated sensitivity analysis performed by 
the management on key assumptions of implied growth 
rates during explicit period and discount rates.
	
Tested the mathematical accuracy of the management 
computations with regard to cash flows and sensitivity 
analysis.
	
Reconciled the cash flow projections used in aforesaid 
valuations to the business plans approved by the Board of 
Directors of the Company
	
Performed independent sensitivity analysis of aforesaid 
key assumptions to assess the effect of reasonably 
possible variations on the current estimated recoverable 
amount for each of the identified investments to evaluate 
sufficiency of headroom between recoverable value and 
carrying amount. 
	
Obtained and evaluated the appropriateness of onerous 
contract provisions under Ind AS 37, Provisions, Contingent 
Liabilities and Contingent Assets for the year ended 31 
March 2024. 
	
Evaluated the appropriateness and adequacy of the 
disclosures made in the standalone financial statements, 
in respect of impairment assessment of specified non-
current financial assets as required by applicable financial 
reporting framework.
Impairment Assessment of Property, plant and equipment, 
Right-to-use of assets and Intangible assets
The Company has non-financial assets in the form of 
Property, Plant and Equipment, Right-to-use of assets 
and Intangible assets (‘specified non-financial assets’) 
which are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation/
amortization and impairment (if any) amounting to

Entertainment Network (India) Limited
Independent Auditor’s Report
Key audit matter
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
As at 31 March 2024, in view of continuous business 
losses in previous year which was determined to be an 
impairment indicator under the requirements of Ind AS 
36, Impairment of Assets (‘Ind AS 36’), the Company has 
performed an impairment assessment of all the specified 
non-financial assets using discounted cash flow method 
to assess the value-in-use of such assets, which requires 
judgement in respect of certain key inputs such as future 
cash flows, determining an appropriate discount rate, etc. 
Based on the aforesaid assessment the Company has 
not recorded further impairment charge against the non-
financial assets during the year ended 31 March 2024 
including for the assets related to ‘Mirchi Love’ and ‘Kool 
FM’, as the recoverable amount is higher than the carrying 
value. 
We considered impairment assessment of property, plant 
and equipment, right-to-use of assets and intangible 
assets as a key audit matter in the current year audit 
because of the significant judgement and management 
estimates involved around impairment assessment.
	
Evaluated the Company’s accounting policy in respect of 
impairment assessment, and the methods and models 
used to determine the recoverable amounts of property, 
plant and equipment, right-to-use of assets and intangible 
assets, in accordance with the requirements of Ind AS 36.

including the discount rates used within the discounted 
cash flow model.

key 
inputs 
and assumptions such as growth rates, etc. used by 
the management in cash flow projections basis our 
understanding of the business and by comparing it with 
readily available market information and underlying 
macro-economic factors.
	
Performed sensitivity analysis on the assumptions used in 
projections to ensure significant headroom.
	
Compared the carrying value of the net assets with the 
estimated discounted future cash flows determined by 
the management and ensured arithmetical accuracy of 
management impairment assessment workings as above.
	
Evaluated the adequacy of the disclosures made in the 
standalone financial statements, in respect of impairment 
assessment of specified non-financial assets as required 
by applicable financial reporting framework.
Recognition of revenue and related contract costs for 
branded and managed solutions business
The Company earns revenue from providing branded 
and managed solutions business that involves providing 
various services which includes managing and organising 
Concerts, Award shows, on air properties, brand licensing, 
multimedia and digital services and managing intellectual 
properties and activities or events of clients. Revenue 
from these contracts is recognized over a period of time in

Key audit matter
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
These services involve multiple performance obligations 
and transaction price is allocated to such identified 
separate performance obligations as per standalone 
selling prices determined by the management for such 
performance obligations.
Further, given the nature of these contracts, revenue 
recognition involves estimation to determine the extent 
of performance obligations satisfied and the proportion of 
contract costs incurred to date and costs that are to be 
recognized as ‘contract assets’ under the requirements 
of Ind AS 115, which involves significant management 
judgments. 
Given the significant estimation involved for branded and 
solutions business, we have identified this as a key audit 
matter.
	
On a sample basis, read the contracts and inspected 
other 
supporting 
documents/evidence 
to 
evaluate 
appropriateness 
of 
management’s 
evaluation 
of 
identification of contractual obligations/ deliverables to 
the customers, determination of progress of completion 
of these deliverables and recording of related revenues 
and costs incurred along with the estimation of balance 
performance obligations and related revenues and costs to 
complete the remaining contractual obligations, pertaining 
to such contracts.
Evaluated the adequacy for disclosure made by the management 
in the accompanying standalone financial statements in 
respect of revenue recognition from the specified business 
in accordance with the requirements of applicable financial 
reporting framework.
Recoverability assessment of deferred tax assets
As detailed in note 11 A to the standalone financial 
statements, the Company has deferred tax assets (‘DTA’) 
(net) amounting to ` 3,524.25 lakhs outstanding as at 
31 March 2024 which includes ` 6,017.30 lakhs of DTA 
recognised on Minimum Alternate Tax (‘MAT’) credit 
and `  886.81 lakhs DTA recognised on brought forward 
business losses.
Refer Note 2(xiv) for the related accounting policy adopted 
by the Company on deferred tax.
The Company’s ability to utilise the deferred tax assets is 
assessed by the management at the close of each reporting 
period and it depends upon the forecasts of future results 
that the Company expects to achieve within the period 
by which such MAT credit and brought forward business 
losses may be adjusted as governed by the provisions of 
the Income Tax Act, 1961.
As per the management’s assessment, the financial 
projections show a significant increase in profitability 
over the coming years, which will result in increase in 
income tax liability against which the available MAT credit 
and brought forward business losses can be utilised as 
mentioned above.
Such financial projections about the growth in business 
operations and activities involves significant management 
judgement and estimates.
We have identified recoverability assessment of deferred 
tax assets based on expected utilisation of MAT credit and 
brought forward business losses, as a key audit matter in 
the current year audit considering the materiality of the 
amounts and significant judgment involved in estimation 
of future taxable profits and the probability of utilising the 
MAT credit and tax losses.
Our audit procedures included, but were not limited to, the 
following:
	
Obtained understanding and evaluation of the process and 
controls designed and implemented by the management 
over recognition and recoverability assessment of DTA 
based on the evaluation of Company’s ability to generate 
sufficient taxable profits in foreseeable future allowing

Independent Auditor’s Report
Key audit matter
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Expected credit losses (‘ECL’) on trade receivables
The Company assesses impairment provision for doubtful 
receivables, based on Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model, 
as per Ind AS 109, Financial Instruments to state the 
entity’s trade receivables to their carrying amount, which 
approximates their fair value. Management evaluates and 
calculates the expected credit losses using a provision 
matrix based on historical credit loss experience, specific 
reviews of customer accounts, experience with such 
customers, current economic and business conditions and 
industry assessment. In calculating expected credit loss, 
the Company has considered related credit information 
for its customers to estimate the probability of default 
in future The Company has trade receivables (net of 
provision) of ` 17,809.40 lakhs and provision of ` 4,360.72 
lakhs as on balance sheet date.
The appropriateness of the provision for expected credit 
loss is subjective due to the high degree of judgment 
applied by management in determining the provisioning 
matrix. Due to the significance of trade receivables and the 
related estimation uncertainty this is considered as a key 
audit matter in the current year.
Our audit procedures included, but were not limited to, the 
following:
	
Obtained understanding of management’s process over 
credit origination, credit monitoring and credit remediation 
by evaluating the Company’s impairment policy and 
methodology;
	
Evaluated management’s continuous assessment of the 
assumptions used in the impairment provision matrix. 
These considerations include whether there are regular 
receipts from the customers, the Company’s past collection 
history as well as an assessment of the customers’ credit 
ability to make payments.
	
Obtained the ageing analysis of trade receivables and 
tested on a sample basis, the ageing of trade receivables at 
year end and discussed with management the reasons of 
any long outstanding amounts where no provisions were 
recorded and also evaluated management’s assumptions 
used in determining the impairment provision, through 
detailed analyses of ageing of receivables, assessment 
of material overdue individual trade receivables and past 
trends of bad debts charged to the statement of profit and 
loss.
	
Verified mathematical accuracy of provision computation 
based on model considered by the management.
Assessed the adequacy for disclosure made by the management 
in the accompanying standalone financial statements in respect 
of ECL in accordance with the requirements of applicable 
financial reporting framework.
Information other than the Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report thereon
7.	
T he Company’s Board of Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information 
included in the Director’s Report, but does not include the standalone financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. 
The Director’s Report is expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditor’s report.
Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not cover the other information and we will not express any form 
of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the standalone financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information 
identified above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent 
with the standalone financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially 
misstated.
When we read the Director’s Report, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to 
communicate the matter to those charged with governance.
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Standalone Financial Statements
8.	
The accompanying standalone financial statements have been approved by the Company’s Board of Directors. The Company’s 
Board of Directors are responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation and 
presentation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial 
performance including other comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance 
with the Ind AS specified under section 133 of the Act and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. This

responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for 
safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and 
application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and 
design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring 
the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the financial 
statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
9.	
In preparing the financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as 
a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting 
unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative 
but to do so.
10.	
The Board of Directors is also responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
11.	
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing 
will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered 
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users 
taken on the basis of these financial statements.
12.	
As part of an audit in accordance with Standards on Auditing , specified under section 143(10) of the Act we exercise professional 
judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
	
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design 
and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than 
for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the 
override of internal control;
	
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate 
in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether 
the Company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating 
effectiveness of such controls;
	
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related 
disclosures made by management;
	
Conclude on the appropriateness of Board of Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the 
audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant 
doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we 
are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such 
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to 
the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as 
a going concern; and
	
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and 
whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair 
presentation. 
13.	
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the 
audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
14.	
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements 
regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought 
to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
15.	
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most

significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe 
these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in 
extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse 
consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Entertainment Network (India) Limited
Annexure II to the Independent Auditor’s Report of even date to the members of 
Entertainment Network (India) Limited on the standalone financial statements for the year 
ended 31 March 2024
Independent Auditor’s Report on the internal financial controls with reference to the standalone financial 
statements under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (‘the Act’) 
1.	
In conjunction with our audit of the standalone financial statements of Entertainment Network (India) Limited (‘the 
Company’) as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024, we have audited the internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements of the Company as at that date. 
Responsibilities of Management for Internal Financial Controls
2.	
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls  based on 
the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements criteria established by the Company considering 
the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over 
Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. These responsibilities include the design, 
implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the 
orderly and efficient conduct of the Company’s business, including adherence to the Company’s policies, the safeguarding 
of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, 
and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Financial Statements 
3.	
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing issued by the Institute 
of Chartered Accountants of India (‘ICAI’) prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit 
of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, and the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial 
Controls Over Financial Reporting (‘the Guidance Note’) issued by the ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require 
that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements were established and maintained and if such 
controls operated effectively in all material respects.
4.	
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements includes obtaining an understanding of such internal financial controls, assessing the risk that a 
material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the 
assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material 
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
5.	
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion 
on the Company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Financial Statements 
6.	
A company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable 
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements include those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, 
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance 
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with 
authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or 
timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect 
on the financial statements.

Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Financial Statements 
7.	
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, including the 
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may 
occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements 
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures 
may deteriorate.
Opinion
8.	
In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements and such controls were operating effectively as at 31 March 2024, based on the internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal 
control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute 
of Chartered Accountants of India.

Summary of material accounting policy information
i.	
Basis of preparation
a.	
Statement of compliance
These standalone financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards 
(hereinafter referred to as the ‘Ind AS’) as notified by Ministry of Corporate Affairs pursuant to section 133 of the 
Companies Act, 2013 read with Rule 3 of the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 as amended, and 
other relevant provisions of the Act and guidelines issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). 
The standalone financial statements have been prepared on an accrual and going concern basis. The accounting 
policies are applied consistently to all the periods presented in the standalone financial statements except where 
a newly issued accounting standard has been adopted or a revision to an existing accounting standard requires a 
consequent change in the accounting policy hitherto in use.
b.	
Current versus non-current classification 
All assets and liabilities have been classified as current or non-current as per the Company’s normal operating 
cycle.
An asset is treated as current when it is:
a)	
Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in the normal operating cycle.
b)	
Held primarily for the purpose of trading.
c)	
Expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting period, or
d)	
A cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least 
twelve months after the reporting period.
All other assets are classified as non-current.
A liability is current when:
a)	
It is expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle.
b)	
It is held primarily for the purpose of trading.
c)	
It is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period, or
d)	
There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the 
reporting period.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and liabilities.
Based on the nature of services and the time between acquisition of assets for processing and their realisation 
in cash and cash equivalents, the Company has ascertained its operating cycle as 12 months for the purpose of 
current or non-current classification of assets and liabilities. The standalone financial statements have been 
prepared on a historical cost basis, except for certain financial assets and liabilities which are measured at fair 
value (refer note ix below)

The functional currency of the Company is the Indian Rupee (₹). These standalone financial statements are 
presented in Indian Rupees rounded off to lakhs.
d.	
Critical estimates and judgements
The preparation of standalone financial statements requires the use of accounting estimates, which will seldom 
equal the actual results. Management also needs to exercise judgement in applying the Company’s accounting 
policies. This note provides an overview of the areas that involved more judgement or complexity, and of items 
which are more likely to be materially adjusted due to estimates and assumptions turning out to be different 
than those originally assessed. Detailed information about each of these estimates and judgements is included 
in relevant notes together with information about the basis of calculation for each affected line item in the 
standalone financial statements.
The areas involving critical estimates or judgements are:
a)	
Useful life of Property, plant and equipment, investment properties and intangible assets - Refer Note 3, Note 
7, Note 8, Note 2(iv), Note 2 (v) and Note 2(vi)
b)	
Impairment of trade receivables - Refer Note 13 and Note 2(ix)(d)
c)	
Recognition and recoverability of deferred tax assets - Refer Note 11A, Note 33 and Note 2(xiv)
d)	
Recognition of Revenue from contracts with customers - Refer Note 26 and Note 2(ii)
e)	
Current tax expense and payable - Refer Note 33, Note 43 (b) and Note 2(xiv)
f)	
Measurement of lease liabilities and Right-of-use assets - Refer Note 4, Note 35 and Note 2(xi) 
g)	
Measurement of defined benefit obligation - Refer Note 38 and Note 2(x)
h)	
Provisions and contingencies, including Royalty - Refer Note 43 (a) and Note 2(xvii)
Estimates and judgements are continuously evaluated. They are based on historical experience and other factors, 
including expectations of future events that may have a financial impact on the Company. The estimates and 
judgments made by the management are believed to be reasonable under the prevailing circumstances.      
ii.	
Revenue from operations
 The core principle of Ind AS 115 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers is that an entity should recognise revenue to 
depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which 
the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Further the standard requires enhanced 
disclosures about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from the entity’s 
contract with customers.
Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised when control of services is transferred to the customer at an 
amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services. 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. The revenue recognised is net 
of discounts, volume rebate and any taxes or duties collected on behalf of the government which are levied on revenue 
such as Goods and Services tax (GST).
The Company provides radio advertising services and Media Solutions to clients. The Company also earns subscription 
revenue through the Gaana App. The Company classifies its media solutions as under: 
i.	
Branded Solutions: The Company provides various branded services which include Concerts, Award Shows, On-Air 
properties, Brand Licensing, Multimedia and Digital services. 
ii.	
Managed Solutions: The Company provides services to manage the intellectual properties, activities or events of 
Clients. 
Revenue from Radio Broadcasting, other services and subscription income
a.	
Revenue from radio broadcasting is recognised on an accrual basis on the airing of client’s commercials. 
b.	
Revenue from solutions business is recognised, in the period in which the performance obligations are satisfied.
c.	
Revenue from subscription is recognised in the period in which the performance obligations are satisfied.

Contract balances
Contract assets
 A contract asset is the right to consideration in exchange for services transferred to the customer. Contract assets are 
recognised when there is excess of revenue earned over billings on contracts. Contract assets are classified as unbilled 
revenues (only act of invoicing is pending) when there is unconditional right to receive cash, and only passage of time 
is required, as per contractual terms.
 Trade receivables
A receivable represents the Company’s right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional (i.e., only the passage 
of time is required before payment of the consideration is due  or payments are already due but yet to be realized). 
 Contract Liability
A contract liability is the obligation to transfer services to a customer for which the Company has received consideration 
(or an amount of consideration is due) from the customer. Contract liabilities are recognised as revenue when the 
Company satisfies its performance obligation under the contract. Unearned and deferred revenue is recognised when 
there are billings in excess of revenues.
 The Company disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers by the nature of services it provides to the 
customers.
The billing schedules agreed with customers include periodic performance based payments. Invoices are payable 
within contractually agreed credit period.
Use of significant judgements in revenue recognition
a.	
The Company’s contracts with customers could include promises to transfer multiple services to a customer. The 
Company assesses the services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract. 
Identification of distinct performance obligation involves judgement to determine the deliverables and the ability of 
the customer to benefit independently from such deliverables.
b.	
Judgement is also required to determine the transaction price for the contract. The transaction price could 
be either a fixed amount of customer consideration or variable consideration with elements such as volume 
rebates and discount. Any consideration payable to the customer is adjusted to the transaction price, unless it is 
a payment for a distinct service from the customer. The estimated amount of variable consideration is adjusted 
in the transaction price only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of 
cumulative revenue recognised will not occur and is reassessed at the end of each reporting period. The Company 
allocates the elements of variable considerations to all the performance obligations of the contract unless there 
is observable evidence that they pertain to one or more distinct performance obligations.
c.	
The Company uses judgement to determine an appropriate standalone selling price for a performance obligation. 
The Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation on the basis of the relative stand-alone 
selling price of each distinct service promised in the contract. 
d.	
The Company exercises judgement in determining whether the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in 
time or over a period of time. The Company considers indicators such as how customer consumes benefits as 
services are rendered or existence of enforceable right to payment for performance to date and alternate use of 
such service, transfer of significant risks and rewards to the customer, acceptance of delivery by the customer, etc.
iii.	
Other income  
a.	
Dividends, if any are recognised in statement of profit and loss only when:
i)	
the right to receive payment is established;
ii)	
it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the dividend will flow to the Company; and 
iii)	
the amount of the dividend can be measured reliably.
b.	
Interest income from financial assets is recognised using the effective interest rate method. The effective interest 
rate is the rate that discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to 
168
Entertainment Network (India) Limited
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 
the gross carrying amount of a financial asset. When calculating the effective interest rate, the Company estimates 
the expected cash flows by considering all the contractual terms of the financial instrument but does not consider 
the expected credit losses. 
iv.	
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment are stated at acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if 
any. Cost of Property, plant and equipment comprises purchase price, duties, levies (excluding input tax credit), and any 
directly attributable cost of bringing the asset to its working condition and location for the intended use. 
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only 
when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Company and the cost of the 
item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to  statement of profit and loss during the 
reporting period in which they are incurred. The carrying amount of any component accounted for as a separate asset 
is derecognised when replaced. The present value of the expected cost for the decommissioning of an asset (after its 
use) is included in the cost of the respective asset if the recognition criteria for a provision are met.
Cost incurred on Property, plant and equipment not ready for their intended use is disclosed as Capital Work-in-
Progress. Advances paid towards the acquisition of Property, Plant and Equipment outstanding at each balance 
sheet date are classified as capital advances under other non-current assets. Unpaid amounts towards acquisition 
of Property, Plant and Equipment outstanding at each balance sheet date are classified under other current financial 
liabilities if due within one year from the date of these standalone financial statements and under other non-current 
financial liabilities if due after a year from the date of these standalone financial statements. 
Depreciation on Property, plant and equipment other than leasehold improvements, is provided on written down value 
(WDV) method as per the useful life and in the manner specified in Schedule II to the Act. Leasehold improvements are 
depreciated on straight line basis, over the lease period.
The estimated useful lives used by the Company to compute depreciation is as under:

An item of Property, Plant & Equipment is derecognised upon disposal and any gain or loss arising on derecognition 
of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is 
included in the statement of profit and loss when the asset is derecognised. Assets to be disposed off are reported at 
the lower of the carrying value or the fair value less cost to sell.
v.	
Intangible assets 
a.	
Frequency Module (FM) Radio Licenses
Non-Refundable One Time Migration Fee paid by the Company for existing FM Radio licenses upon migration to 
Phase III of the Licensing policy and Non-Refundable One Time Entry Fee paid by the Company for acquiring new 
FM radio licenses have been capitalised as an intangible asset. These assets are stated at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and impairment losses, if applicable.

The amortisation period and the amortisation method for finite-life intangible assets is reviewed at each financial 
year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.
b.	
Software
a.	
Software acquired initially together with hardware is capitalised along with the cost of hardware and 
depreciated in the same manner as the hardware. All subsequent purchases of software licenses are treated 
as revenue expenditure and charged to the statement of profit and loss account in the year of purchase.
b.	
Expenditure on Enterprise Software such as SAP, Sales CRM and Performance Appraisal Software etc. where 
the economic benefit is expected to be more than a year is recognised as an “Intangible Asset” and are 
amortised over a period of 45 to 60 months. 
vi.	
Investment properties
Investment in buildings that is not intended to be occupied substantially for use by, or in the operations of the 
Company, have been classified as investment property. Investment properties are measured initially at cost, 
including transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties are stated at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss, if any. All repairs and maintenance costs incurred 
for the investment properties are charged to statement of profit and loss account when incurred.
Investment properties are depreciated using the written down value method over their estimated useful lives. 
Investment properties generally have a useful life of 60 years.
Though the Company measures investment property using cost based measurement, the fair value of investment 
property is disclosed in the notes (Refer note 7). Fair values are determined based on an annual evaluation performed 
by a registered valuer. If at the balance sheet date there is an indication that a previously assessed impairment loss no 
longer exists, the recoverable amount is reassessed and the asset is reflected at the recoverable amount subject to a 
maximum of depreciated historical carrying value.
Investment properties are derecognised either when they have been disposed of or when they are permanently 
withdrawn from use and no future economic benefit is expected from their disposal. The difference between the net 
disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset is recognised in profit or loss in the period of derecognition.
vii.	 Borrowing cost
Borrowing cost directly attributable to qualifying assets, which take substantial period to get ready for its intended 
use, are capitalized to the extent they relate to the period until such assets are ready to be put to use. Other borrowing 
costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred. The Company is debt free and hence there 
are no borrowing cost.
viii.	 Foreign currency transactions 
Foreign currency transactions are recorded at the exchange rates prevailing on the date of the transaction. Gains and 
losses arising out of subsequent fluctuations are accounted for on actual payment or realisation. Monetary items 
denominated in foreign currency as at the balance sheet date are converted at the exchange rates prevailing on that 
day. Exchange differences are recognised in the statement of profit and loss.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the 
exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions.

ix.	
Financial instruments
a.	
Recognition and initial measurement
The Company recognizes trade receivables and trade payables when they are originated at transaction price. 
All other financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Company becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument. All financial assets and liabilities are recognised at fair value. In case 
of financial assets and liabilities that are not measured at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable 
transaction costs are added to the fair value on initial recognition.
b.	
Classification and subsequent measurement
i.	
Financial assets 
The Company classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:
	
those to be measured at fair value through profit or loss; and
	
those measured at amortised cost.
The classification depends on the Company’s business model for managing the financial assets and the 
contractual terms of the cash flows.
Investments that are intended to be held for not more than a year from the date of investment are classified 
as current investments. All other investments are termed as long term investments. The portion of long 
term investments which is expected to be realized within twelve months from the balance sheet date are 
classified as current investments.
Realised and unrealised gains/ losses arising from changes in the fair value of the “financial assets at fair 
value through profit or loss” investment category are included in the statement of profit and loss in the 
period in which they arise.
ii.	
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are subsequently carried at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. For 
trade and other payables, the carrying amounts represents the fair value due to the short maturity of these 
instruments.
Realised and unrealised gains/ losses arising from changes in the fair value of the “financial liabilities at fair 
value through profit or loss” are included in the statement of profit and loss in the period in which they arise.
iii.	 Investment in subsidiaries
Investment in subsidiaries are carried at cost less impairment, if any.
Subsidiary means an entity in which the Company controls the composition of the Board of Directors; or 
exercises or controls more than one-half of the total voting power either at its own or together with one or 
more of its subsidiaries.
The Company’s investments in subsidiaries are recognised at cost as per Ind AS 27. The Company determines 
whether it is necessary to recognise an impairment loss in its investment in its subsidiaries. At each reporting 
date, the Company determines whether there is objective evidence that the investment in the subsidiary 
has impaired. If there is such evidence, the Company calculates the amount of impairment as the difference 
between the recoverable amount of the subsidiary and its carrying value and recognises the impairment loss 
in the statement of profit and loss.
c.	
Derecognition of financial instruments
The Company derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset 
expire or it transfers the financial asset and the transfer qualifies for derecognition under Ind AS 109- ‘Financial 
Instruments’. A financial liability (or part of a financial liability) is derecognised from the Company’s Balance Sheet 
when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged or cancelled or expires.

Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 
d.	
Impairment of financial assets
The Company assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its assets carried at 
amortised cost. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase 
in the credit risk.
For trade receivables, the Company applies the simplified approach permitted by Ind AS 109- ‘Financial 
Instruments’, which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables . 
Lifetime losses are the expected credit losses resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of 
a trade receivables.
 The Company uses a provision matrix to determine impairment loss allowance on portfolio of its trade receivables. 
The provision matrix is based on its historically observed default rates over the expected life of the trade 
receivables and is adjusted for forward-looking estimates. Every year, the historical observed default rates are 
updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed.
x.	
Employee benefits
a.	
Defined Contribution Plans:	
The Company has defined contribution plans for post-employment benefits such as Provident Fund, National 
Pension Scheme, Employee’s State Insurance and Employee’s Pension Scheme, 1995. The Company contributes 
to a government administered Provident Fund, state plan namely Employee’s Pension Scheme, 1995, Employee’s 
State Insurance Scheme and National Pension Scheme on behalf of its employees and has no further obligation 
beyond making its contribution.	
The Company’s contributions to the above funds are recognised in the statement of profit and loss every 
year.	
b.	
Defined Benefit Plans:
The Company provides for gratuity benefit, which is a defined benefit plan, covering all its eligible employees. 
Liability for defined benefit plans is provided based on valuations, as at the balance sheet date, carried out by an 
independent actuary. The actuarial valuation method used by the independent actuary for measuring the liability 
is the projected unit credit method. 
Actuarial losses and gains are recognised in other comprehensive income and shall not be reclassified to the 
statement of profit and loss in a subsequent period. 
Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation resulting from plan amendments or curtailments 
are recognised immediately in the statement of profit and loss as past service costs. 
The Code on Social Security, 2020 (“the Code”) relating to employee benefits during employment and post-
employment benefits received Presidential assent in September 2020. The Code has been published in the Gazette 
of India. However, the date on which the Code will come into effect has not been notified and the final rules/ 
interpretation have not yet been issued. The Company will assess the impact of the Code when it comes into effect 
and will record any related impact in the period the Code becomes effective.
c.	
Other long term benefits
The Company has other long term benefits namely compensated absences for all its employees. The liabilities in 
respect of compensated absences which are expected to be encashed / utilised within twelve months from the 
balance sheet date are current. Other such liabilities are considered non-current.
d.	
Termination benefits are recognised as an expense as and when incurred.
xi.	
Leases 
The Company assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract conveys 
the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for a consideration.
Company as a lessee
The Company applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and 
172
Entertainment Network (India) Limited
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 
leases of low-value assets. The Company recognises lease liabilities in respect of future lease payments and Right of 
Use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets.
i)	
Right of Use assets
The Company recognises  Right of Use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the underlying 
asset is available for use). Right of Use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and 
impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of Right of Use assets 
includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at 
or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Right of Use assets are depreciated on a 
straight-line basis over the lease term.
ii)	
Lease liabilities
The Company recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the 
lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments less any lease incentives receivable 
In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate at the 
lease commencement date or April 1, 2019 whichever is later. After the commencement date, the amount of lease 
liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, 
the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification or a change in the lease term or a 
change in the lease payments.
iii)	 Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets 
The Company applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its leases that have a lease term of 12 months 
or less and leases of low value assets. The Company recognises the lease payments associated with these leases 
as an expense in the statement of Profit and loss.
iv)	 Termination/Modification of lease
The gain or loss arising from termination shall be determined as the difference between the carrying value of 
lease liability, and the carrying amount of right to use asset. It shall be recognised in statement of profit and loss 
when the asset is derecognised. 
For a lease modification that is not accounted for as a separate lease, the Company accounts for the remeasurement 
of the lease liability by: 
(a)	 decreasing the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset to reflect the partial or full termination of the lease 
for lease modifications that decrease the scope of the lease. The Company recognises in profit or loss any 
gain or loss relating to the partial or full termination of the lease. 
(b)	 making a corresponding adjustment to the right-of-use asset for all other lease modifications.
xii.	 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, demand deposits with banks and other short-term highly liquid 
investments with original maturities of three months or less. Bank overdrafts, if any are shown as borrowings under 
current financial liabilities in the balance sheet.
xiii.	 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit or loss for the period attributable to equity shareholders 
by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period. The weighted average number of equity 
shares outstanding during the period and for all periods presented is adjusted for events (such as bonus shares), if 
any, other than the conversion of potential equity shares that have changed the number of equity shares outstanding 
without a corresponding change in resources. For calculating diluted earnings per share, the net profit or loss for the 
period attributable to equity shareholders and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period 
are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares.
xiv.	 Taxes
Tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current income tax and deferred tax are measured based on the 
Annual Report 2023-24
173

Financial Statements
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 
amount expected to be paid to the tax authorities in accordance with the Income Tax Act, 1961.
Current Tax 
Current tax in the Statement of Profit and Loss is provided as the amount of tax payable in respect of taxable income 
for the period using tax rates and tax laws  that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT)
MAT paid in accordance with tax laws which give rise to future economic benefits in the form of adjustment to future 
income tax liability is considered as an asset, if there is convincing evidence that the Company will pay normal tax in 
future. Accordingly, MAT is recognised as a deferred tax asset in the balance sheet when it is probable that the future 
economic benefit associated with it will flow to the Company and the asset can be measured reliably. The Company 
reviews the ‘Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) Credit Entitlement’ asset at each reporting date and writes down the asset to 
the extent the Company does not have convincing evidence that it will pay normal tax during the specified period i.e. 
the period for which MAT credit is allowed to be carried forward.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets 
and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the standalone financial statements. Deferred tax assets are recognised 
only to the extent that there is reasonable certainty that sufficient future taxable income will be available against which 
such deferred tax assets can be realised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there 
is an intention to settle the asset and the liability on a net basis.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. 
Unrecognised deferred tax assets, if any are re-assessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it 
has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Current and deferred tax is recognised in the statement of profit and loss, except to the extent that it relates to the 
items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In such situations, the tax is also recognised in 
other comprehensive income or directly in equity, as the case may be.
xv.	
GST paid on acquisition of assets or on incurring expenses
Expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of GST, except
a.	
When the tax incurred on purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which 
case, the tax paid is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item, as 
applicable. 
b.	
The net amount of tax receivable/ payable is included as part of receivables/payables, as the case may be, in the 
balance sheet. 
xvi.	 Impairment of non-financial assets
The Company assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is any indication that a non-financial asset, other 
than goodwill, may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of such 
asset.  If recoverable amount of such asset or the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset 
belongs is less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable amount. The reduction is 
treated as an impairment loss and is recognised in the statement of profit and loss. If at the balance sheet date there 
is an indication that a previously assessed impairment loss no longer exists, the recoverable amount is reassessed and 
the asset is reflected at the recoverable amount subject to a maximum of depreciated historical carrying value.
Goodwill if any, is not subject to amortisation and is tested for impairment at each reporting date. An impairment loss 
recognised for goodwill shall not be reversed in a subsequent period.

Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 
xvii.	 Provisions and contingent liabilities
The Company recognises a provision when there is a present obligation as a result of a past event that probably 
requires an outflow of resources and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are 
determined based on best estimates of the amount required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date. These 
are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimates. If the effect of time value of 
money is material, provisions are discounted. The discount rate used to determine the present value is a pre-tax rate 
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The increase 
in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as interest expense. 
A disclosure for a contingent liability is made when there is a possible obligation or a present obligation that may, but 
probably will not, require an outflow of resources embodying economic benefit. Where there is a possible obligation or 
a present obligation that the likelihood of outflow of resources is remote, no provision or disclosure is made.
xviii.	Dividends 
Final dividend on shares is recorded as a liability on the date of approval by the shareholders and interim dividend is 
recorded as a liability on the date of approval by the Company’s Board of Directors.
xix.	 License Fees 
As per the applicable Frequency Module (FM) broadcasting policy, license fees is recognised in statement of profit and 
loss at the rate of 4% of gross revenue or minimum fixed fee for the concerned city, whichever is higher. Minimum fixed 
fee is 2.5% of the Non-Refundable One Time Entry Fee (NOTEF). 
However, for the first three years of operations in the States of North East (i.e. Assam and Meghalaya) and Jammu & 
Kashmir the rate of License fee was 2% of Gross Revenue or 1.25% of NOTEF, whichever was higher.
Gross Revenue for this purpose shall mean revenue on the basis of billing rates inclusive of any taxes. Barter advertising 
contracts are also included in the gross revenue on the basis of relevant billing rates. NOTEF means the successful bid 
amount arrived at through an ascending e-auction process for private FM Radio Phase-III Channels conducted by the 
Ministry of Information & Broadcasting (‘MIB’).

Recent accounting developments
i.	
Standards issued but not yet effective
The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new standard or amendments to the existing standards. As on 
March 31, 2024, MCA has not notified any new standards or amendments to the existing standards applicable to 
the Company.
ii.	
 Standards issued / amended and became effective
The Ministry of Corporate Affairs has notified Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2023 
dated March 31, 2023, to amend the following Ind AS which are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 
April 1, 2023. The Company has applied for the first-time these amendments.
a)	
Disclosure of Accounting Policies - Amendments to Ind AS 1
The amendments aim to help entities provide accounting policy disclosures that are more useful by replacing 
the requirement for entities to disclose their ‘significant’ accounting policies with a requirement to disclose 
their ‘material’ accounting policies and adding guidance on how entities apply the concept of materiality 
in making decisions about accounting policy disclosures. The amendments have had an impact on the 
Company’s disclosures of accounting policies, but not on the measurement, recognition or presentation of 
any items in the Company’s standalone financial statements.
b)	
Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction - Amendments to Ind AS 12
The amendments narrow the scope of the initial recognition exception under Ind AS 12, so that it no longer 
applies to transactions that give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences such as leases.
The Company does have leases and it continues to disclose deferred tax asset.
This amendment did not have any material impact on the amounts recognised in prior periods and do not 
affect the current period or are expected to significantly affect future periods.
c)	
Definition of Accounting Estimates - Amendments to Ind AS 8
The amendments clarify the distinction between changes in accounting estimates and changes in accounting 
policies and the correction of errors. It has also been clarified how entities use measurement techniques and 
inputs to develop accounting estimates.

While disclosing the aggregate amount of transaction price yet to be recognised as revenue towards unsatisfied (or partially 
satisfied) performance obligations, along with the broad time band for the expected time to recognise those revenues, the Company 
has applied the practical expedient in Ind AS 115 as unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligation are parts of contracts 
that have an original expected duration of one year or less. Accordingly, the Company has not disclosed the aggregate transaction 
price allocated to unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations which pertain to contracts where revenue recognised 
corresponds to the value transferred to customer typically involving time and material outcome based and event based contracts.

Right of Use Asset
For new lease contracts, the Company recognises a Right of Use asset and a corresponding lease liability with respect to all 
lease agreements in which it is the lessee. The lease liability and the Right of Use assets is initially measured at the present 
value of remaining lease payments, discounted using the incremental borrowing rate at the date of recognition. Depreciation 
is computed using straight-line method over the lease term. The Company’s Right of Use assets were recognised and shown 
separately in the Balance Sheet (Refer Note 4).
Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets
The Company has elected not to recognise Right of Use assets and lease liabilities for short term leases
that have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases of low value assets. The Company recognises the lease payments 
associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
For the year:
a.	
Depreciation expense increased by ` 1,881.82 lakhs (previous year: ` 1,897.92 lakhs) on account of depreciation on Right 
of Use assets recognised.
b.	
Rent expense included in ‘Operating and other expenses’, decreased by ` 3,101.00 lakhs (previous year:  ` 2,988.64  lakhs) 
on account of operating leases recognised previously.

liabilities recognised.
d.

decrease in operating lease payments. 
e.

in principal and interest payments of lease liabilities.

Defined Benefit Plans
Post-employment obligations
Plan is governed by the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. Under the Gratuity Act. Employees who are in continuous service 
for a period of 5 years or death while in employment are eligible for gratuity. The amount of gratuity payable on 
retirement/termination is the employees last drawn basic salary per month computed proportionately for 15 days’ 
salary multiplied for the number of years of service. The liability in respect of gratuity is uncapped and is not restricted 
to ` 20 lakhs.
These plans typically expose the Company to actuarial risks such as interest risk and salary inflation risk.
a)	
Interest risk - A decrease in the discount rate will increase the plan liability.
b)	
Salary inflation risk – The present value of the defined plan liability is calculated by reference to the future 
salaries of plan participants. As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the plan’s 
liability.
In accordance with Ind AS 19, actuarial valuation was done in respect of the aforesaid Defined Benefit Plan of gratuity 
(unfunded) based on the following assumptions:

accordance with Company’s policies and risk objectives. The Company’s activities expose it to a variety of credit risks, market 
risks and liquidity risks. This note explains the sources of risk which the entity is exposed to and how the entity manages the

loss. The Company uses a provision matrix to compute the expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables. The 
provision matrix considers available external and internal credit risk factors and the Company’s historical experience

To the Members of Entertainment Network (India) Limited
Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Opinion
1.	
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Entertainment Network (India) Limited (‘the Holding 
Company’) and its subsidiaries (the Holding Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as ‘the Group’), as listed in 
Annexure 1, which comprise the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at 31 March 2024, the Consolidated Statement of Profit and 
Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement and the Consolidated Statement 
of Changes in Equity for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a material 
accounting policy information and other explanatory information.
2.	
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us and based on the 
consideration of the reports of the other auditors on separate financial statements and on the other financial information of 
the subsidiaries  the aforesaid consolidated financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 
(‘the Act’) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards (‘Ind 
AS’) specified under section 133 of the Act, read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, and other 
accounting principles generally accepted in India of the consolidated state of affairs of the Group, as at 31 March 2024, and 
their consolidated profit (including other comprehensive income), consolidated cash flows and the consolidated changes in 
equity for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
3.	
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our 
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group, in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by 
the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (‘ICAI’) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit 
of the consolidated financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled 
our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit 
evidence we have obtained together with the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms of their reports referred 
to in paragraph 15 of the Other Matters section below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Emphasis of Matter- Restatement on account of common control transaction
4.	
We draw attention to note 49 to the accompanying consolidated financial results, which describes that pursuant to the 
Business Transfer Agreement (BTA) between the Holding Company and Gamma Gaana Limited (‘GGL’) as approved by Board 
of Directors of the Holding Company on October 20, 2023 a business undertaking of GGL has been transferred to and merged 
with the Holding Company and accounted in accordance with the requirements of Appendix C to Ind AS 103, Business 
Combinations. Accordingly, the comparative financial information, has been restated in the accompanying consolidated 
financial results to reflect the aforesaid merger from the beginning of the earliest period presented, as described in the said 
note. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.
Key Audit Matters
5.	
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the 
consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the 
consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion 
on these matters.
6.	
We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.
Key audit matter
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Impairment Assessment of Property, plant and equipment, 
Right-to-use of assets and Intangible assets

Plant and Equipment, Right-to-use of assets and Intangible 
assets (‘specified non-financial assets’) which are carried

and impairment (if any) amounting to `  5,493.71 lakhs, ` 
13,496.18 lakhs and ` 30,683.07 lakhs respectively as at 31 
March 2024.
Our audit procedures included, but were not limited to, the 
following:
	

Entertainment Network (India) Limited
Key audit matter
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
As at 31 March 2024, in view of recent business losses which 
was determined to be an impairment indicator under the 
requirements of Ind AS 36, Impairment of Assets (‘Ind AS 
36’), the Group has performed an impairment assessment 
of all the specified non-financial assets using discounted 
cash flow method to assess the value-in-use of such assets, 
which requires judgement in respect of certain key inputs 
such as future cash flows, determining an appropriate 
discount rate, etc. 
Based on the aforesaid assessment the Group has not 
recorded further impairment charge against the non-
financial assets during the year ended 31 March 2024 
including for the assets related to ‘Mirchi Love’ and ‘Kool 
FM’, as the recoverable amount is higher than the carrying 
value. 
We considered impairment assessment of property, plant 
and equipment, right-to-use of assets and intangible 
assets as a key audit matter in the current year audit 
because of the significant judgement and management 
estimates involved around impairment assessment.
	
Evaluated the Group accounting policy in respect of 
impairment assessment, and the methods and models 
used to determine the recoverable amounts of property, 
plant and equipment, right-to-use of assets and intangible 
assets, in accordance with the requirements of Ind AS 36.
	
Reviewed the process of determination of the level at 
which the impairment assessment was performed by 
the Group and assessed that the same is in line with the 
requirements of Ind AS 36 considering the nature of the 
Group operations.
	
Involved our internal valuation experts and reviewed 
the appropriateness of the key valuation assumptions 
including the discount rates used within the discounted 
cash flow model.
	
Evaluated 
the 
reasonableness 
of 
the 
key 
inputs 
and assumptions such as growth rates, etc. used by 
the management in cash flow projections basis our 
understanding of the business and by comparing it with 
readily available market information and underlying 
macro-economic factors.
	
Performed sensitivity analysis on the assumptions used in 
projections to ensure significant headroom.
	
Compared the carrying value of the net assets with the 
estimated discounted future cash flows determined by 
the management and ensured arithmetical accuracy of 
management impairment assessment workings as above.
	
Evaluated the adequacy of the disclosures made in the 
consolidated financial statements, in respect of impairment 
assessment of specified non-financial assets as required 
by applicable financial reporting framework.
Recognition of revenue and related contract costs for 
branded and managed solutions business
The Group earns revenue from providing branded and 
managed solutions business that involves providing 
various services which includes managing and organising 
Concerts, Award shows, on air properties, brand licensing, 
multimedia and digital services and managing intellectual 
properties and activities or events of clients. Revenue 
from these contracts is recognized over a period of time in 
accordance with the requirements of Ind AS 115, Revenue 
from Contracts with Customers (‘Ind AS 115’). 
Refer Note 27 (A) (II) for the revenue recorded for the year 
pertaining to aforesaid business and Note 2(ii) for the 
related accounting policy adopted by the management in 
this respect.
Our audit procedures included, but were not limited to, the 
following:
	
Obtained Group’s accounting policies pertaining to 
revenue recognition and assessed compliance with the 
requirements of Ind AS 115.
	

Key audit matter
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
These services involve multiple performance obligations 
and transaction price is allocated to such identified 
separate performance obligations as per standalone 
selling prices determined by the management for such 
performance obligations. 
Further, given the nature of these contracts, revenue 
recognition involves estimation to determine the extent 
of performance obligations satisfied and the proportion of 
contract costs incurred to date and costs that are to be 
recognized as ‘contract assets’ under the requirements 
of Ind AS 115, which involves significant management 
judgments. 
Given the significant estimation involved for branded and 
solutions business, we have identified this as a key audit 
matter.
	
On a sample basis, read the contracts and inspected 
other 
supporting 
documents/evidence 
to 
evaluate 
appropriateness 
of 
management’s 
evaluation 
of 
identification of contractual obligations/ deliverables to 
the customers, determination of progress of completion 
of these deliverables and recording of related revenues 
and costs incurred along with the estimation of balance 
performance obligations and related revenues and costs to 
complete the remaining contractual obligations, pertaining 
to such contracts.
Evaluated the adequacy for disclosure made by the management 
in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in 
respect of revenue recognition from the specified business 
in accordance with the requirements of applicable financial 
reporting framework.
Recoverability assessment of deferred tax assets
As detailed in note 10A to the consolidated financial 
statements, the Group has deferred tax assets (‘DTA’) (net) 
amounting to ` 3,581.71 lakhs outstanding as at 31 March 
2024 which includes ` 6,074.69 lakhs of DTA recognised on 
Minimum Alternate Tax (‘MAT’) credit and ` 886.81 lakhs 
DTA recognised on brought forward business losses.
Refer Note 2(xiv) for the related accounting policy adopted 
by the Group on deferred tax.
The Group’s ability to utilise the deferred tax assets is 
assessed by the management at the close of each reporting 
period and it depends upon the forecasts of future results 
that the Group expects to achieve within the period by 
which such MAT credit and brought forward business 
losses may be adjusted as governed by the provisions of 
the Income Tax Act, 1961.
As per the management’s assessment, the financial 
projections show a significant increase in profitability 
over the coming years, which will result in increase in 
income tax liability against which the available MAT credit 
and brought forward business losses can be utilised as 
mentioned above.
Such financial projections about the growth in business 
operations and activities involves significant management 
judgement and estimates.
We have identified recoverability assessment of deferred 
tax assets based on expected utilisation of MAT credit and 
brought forward business losses, as a key audit matter in 
the current year audit considering the materiality of the 
amounts and significant judgment involved in estimation 
of future taxable profits and the probability of utilising the 
MAT credit and tax losses.
Our audit procedures included, but were not limited to, the 
following:
	
Obtained understanding and evaluation of the process and 
controls designed and implemented by the management 
over recognition and recoverability assessment of DTA 
based on the evaluation of Group’s ability to generate 
sufficient taxable profits in foreseeable future allowing 
the use of deferred tax assets on MAT credit and Business 
losses within the time prescribed by income tax laws. 
Further, tested the operating effectiveness of such controls.
	
Obtained the financial projections prepared by the 
management and verified the cash flow forecasts used 
in the recoverability assessment of DTA to the approved 
business plans.
	
Reviewed the historical accuracy of the cash flow 
projections prepared by the management in prior periods. 
Obtained understanding from the management about the 
predicted business growth and viability of achieving those 
projections. 
	
Evaluated management’s assessment of time period 
available for adjustment of such deferred tax assets on 
MAT credit and Business losses as per provisions of the 
Income Tax Act, 1961 and appropriateness of the accounting 
treatment with respect to the recognition of deferred 
tax assets on MAT credit and business losses as per the 
requirements of Ind AS 12, Income Taxes. 
Assessed the adequacy of the disclosures made in the 
consolidated financial statements in respect of aforesaid DTA 
balances in accordance with the requirements of applicable 
financial reporting framework.

Key audit matter
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Expected credit losses (‘ECL’) on trade receivables
The Group assesses impairment provision for doubtful 
receivables, based on Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model, 
as per Ind AS 109, Financial Instruments to state the 
entity’s trade receivables to their carrying amount, which 
approximates their fair value. Management evaluates and 
calculates the expected credit losses using a provision 
matrix based on historical credit loss experience, specific 
reviews of customer accounts, experience with such 
customers, current economic and business conditions 
and industry assessment. In calculating expected credit 
loss, the Group has considered related credit information 
for its customers to estimate the probability of default in 
future. The Group has trade receivables (net of provision) 
of ` 18,234.36 lakhs and provision of ` 4,476.16 lakhs as on 
balance sheet date.
The appropriateness of the provision for expected credit 
loss is subjective due to the high degree of judgment 
applied by management in determining the provisioning 
matrix. Due to the significance of trade receivables and the 
related estimation uncertainty this is considered as a key 
audit matter in the current year.
Our audit procedures included, but were not limited to, the 
following:
	
Obtained 
understanding 
of 
management’s 
process 
over credit origination, credit monitoring and credit 
remediation by evaluating the Group’s impairment policy 
and methodology;
	
Evaluated management’s continuous assessment of the 
assumptions used in the impairment provision matrix. 
These considerations include whether there are regular 
receipts from the customers, the Group’s past collection 
history as well as an assessment of the customers’ credit 
ability to make payments.
	
Obtained the ageing analysis of trade receivables and 
tested on a sample basis, the ageing of trade receivables at 
year end and discussed with management the reasons of 
any long outstanding amounts where no provisions were 
recorded and also evaluated management’s assumptions 
used in determining the impairment provision, through 
detailed analyses of ageing of receivables, assessment 
of material overdue individual trade receivables and past 
trends of bad debts charged to the statement of profit and 
loss.
	
Verified mathematical accuracy of provision computation 
based on model considered by the management.
Assessed the adequacy for disclosure made by the management 
in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in 
respect of ECL in accordance with the requirements of applicable 
financial reporting framework.

equity and consolidated cash flows of the Group in accordance with the Ind AS specified under section 133 of the Act read with 
the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. The 
Holding Company’s Board of Directors are also responsible for ensuring accuracy of records including financial information 
considered necessary for the preparation of consolidated Ind AS financial statements. Further, in terms of the provisions of 
the Act the respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group, covered under the Act are responsible for 
maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the 
Group and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting 
policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance 
of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the 
accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view 
and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. These financial statements have been used for 
the purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial statements by the Board of Directors of the Holding Company, as 
aforesaid.
9.	
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group 
are responsible for assessing the ability of the Group to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related 
to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intend to liquidate the 
Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
10.	
Those respective Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process of the companies 
included in the Group.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
11.	
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with 
Standards on Auditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error 
and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
12.	
As part of an audit in accordance with Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Act we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
	
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or 
error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher 
than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the 
override of internal control;
	
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate 
in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether 
the Holding Company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in place and the 
operating effectiveness of such controls.;
	
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related 
disclosures made by management;
	
Conclude on the appropriateness of Board of Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the 
audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant 
doubt on the ability of the Group to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we 
are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements 
or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained 
up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue 
as a going concern; 
	
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a 
manner that achieves fair presentation; and
Independent Auditor’s Report
218
Entertainment Network (India) Limited
	
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial statements of the entities or business activities 
within the Group, to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, 
supervision and performance of the audit of financial statements of such entities included in the financial statements, 
of which we are the independent auditors. For the other entities included in the financial statements, which have been 
audited by the other auditors, such other auditors remain responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of 
the audits carried out by them. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
13.	
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the 
audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
14.	
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements 
regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought 
to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
15.	
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit 
matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the 
matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report 
because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of 
such communication.
Other Matter
16.	
We did not audit the financial statements of two subsidiaries, whose financial statements reflect total assets of 
` 2,204.75 lakhs as at 31 March 2024, total revenues of ` 1,167.73 lakhs and net cash inflows amounting to ` 126.25 lakhs for 
the year ended on that date, as considered in the consolidated financial statements. These financial statements have been 
audited by other auditors whose report(s) has been furnished to us by the management and our opinion on the consolidated 
financial statements, in so far as it relates to the amounts and disclosures included in respect of these subsidiaries, and 
our report in terms of sub-section (3) of section 143 of the Act in so far as it relates to the aforesaid subsidiaries, are based 
solely on the reports of the other auditors.
Further, the above two (2) mentioned subsidiaries, are located outside India whose financial statements and other financial 
information have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in their respective countries 
and which have been audited by other auditors under generally accepted auditing standards applicable in their respective 
countries. The Holding Company’s management has converted the financial statements of such subsidiaries located outside 
India from accounting principles generally accepted in their respective countries to accounting principles generally accepted 
in India. The other auditors have audited these conversion adjustments made by the Holding Company’s management. Our 
opinion on the consolidated financial statements, in so far as it relates to the amounts and disclosures included in respect 
of such subsidiaries located outside India, is based on the report of other auditors and the conversion adjustments prepared 
by the management of the Holding Company and audited by other auditors.
Our opinion above on the consolidated financial statements, and our report on other legal and regulatory requirements 
below, are not modified in respect of the above matters with respect to our reliance on the work done by and the reports of 
the other auditors.
Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements
17.

that one subsidiary company, incorporated in India whose financial statements have been audited under the Act have  not 
paid or provided for any managerial remuneration during the year. Accordingly, reporting under section 197(16) of the Act is 
not applicable in respect of such subsidiary company.
18.	
As required by clause (xxi) of paragraph 3 of Companies (Auditor’s Report) Order, 2020 (‘the Order’) issued by the Central

Independent Auditor’s Report on the internal financial controls with reference to the consolidated financial 
statements under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (‘the Act’) 
1.	
In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial statements of Entertainment Network (India) Limited (‘the Holding 
Company’) and its subsidiaries ( the Holding Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as “the Group”), as at and for 
the year ended 31 March 2024, we have audited the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements of the 
Holding Company and its subsidiary company which are companies covered under the Act, as at that date. 
Responsibilities of Management for Internal Financial Controls
2.	
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls  based on the 
internal financial controls with reference to financial statements criteria established by the Holding Company considering 
the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over 
Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. These responsibilities include the design, 
implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the 
orderly and efficient conduct of the Company’s business, including adherence to the Company’s policies, the safeguarding of 
its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and 
the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Financial Statements 
3.	
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements 
for the Holding Company and its subsidiary company, based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the 
Standards on Auditing issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (‘ICAI’) prescribed under Section 143(10) of 
the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, and the 
Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (‘the Guidance Note’) issued by the ICAI. 
Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements were 
established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
4.	
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls 
with reference to consolidated financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls 
with reference to consolidated financial statements includes obtaining an understanding of such internal financial controls, 
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of 
internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
5.	
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on 
the Company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements of the Holding Company and its subsidiary 
companies as aforesaid.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Financial Statements 
6.	
A company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable 
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements include those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, 
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance 
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with 
authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or 
timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect 
on the financial statements.

Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Financial Statements 
7.	
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated  financial statements, 
including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or 
fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to 
consolidated financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the 
policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
8.	
In our opinion, the Holding Company and its subsidiary companies, which are companies covered under the Act, have in 
all material respects, adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements and such controls were 
operating effectively as at 31 March 2024, based on the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements 
criteria established by the Holding Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance 
Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of 
India.

Summary of material accounting policy information
i.	
Basis of preparation
a.	
Statement of Compliance
These consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with the Indian Accounting 
Standards (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Ind AS’) as notified by Ministry of Corporate Affairs pursuant to section 
133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with Rule 3 of the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 as 
amended, and other relevant provisions of the Act and guidelines issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of 
India (SEBI). The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on an accrual and going concern basis. The 
accounting policies are applied consistently to all the periods presented in the consolidated financial statements 
except where a newly issued accounting standard has been adopted or a revision to an existing accounting standard 
requires a consequent change in the accounting policy hitherto in use.
b.	
Current versus non-current classification
All assets and liabilities have been classified as current or non-current as per the Group’s normal operating cycle.
An asset is treated as current when it is:
a)	
Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in the normal operating cycle
b)	
Held primarily for the purpose of trading
c)	
Expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting period, or
d)	
Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve 
months after the reporting period

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
All other assets are classified as non-current.
A liability is current when:
a)	
It is expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle
b)	
It is held primarily for the purpose of trading
c)	
It is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period, or
d)	
There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the 
reporting period
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and liabilities.
Based on the nature of services and the time between acquisition of assets for processing and their realisation in 
cash and cash equivalents, the Group has ascertained its operating cycle as 12 months for the purpose of current 
or non-current classification of assets and liabilities. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on 
a historical cost basis, except for certain financial assets and liabilities which are measured at fair value (refer note 
x below)
c.	
Functional currency 
The Functional Currency of the Group is the Indian Rupee (`). These consolidated financial statements are 
presented in Indian Rupees rounded off to lakhs.
d.	
Critical estimates and / or judgements
The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the use of accounting estimates, which will seldom 
equal the actual results. Management also needs to exercise judgement in applying the Group’s accounting policies. 
This note provides an overview of the areas that involved more judgement or complexity, and of items which are 
more likely to be materially adjusted due to estimates and assumptions turning out to be different than those 
originally assessed. Detailed information about each of these estimates and judgements is included in relevant 
notes together with information about the basis of calculation for each affected line item in the consolidated 
financial statements.
The areas involving critical estimates or judgements are:
a)	
Useful life of Property, plant and equipment, investment properties and intangible assets - Refer Note 3, Note 
7, Note 8, Note 2(v), Note 2(vi) and Note 2(vii)
b)	
Impairment of trade receivables - Refer Note 13 and Note 2(x)(d)
c)	
Recognition and recoverability of deferred tax assets - Refer Note 11, Note 33 and Note 2(xv)
d)	
Recognition of revenue from contracts with customers - Refer Note 27 and Note 2(ii)
e)	
Current tax expense and payable - Refer Note 33, Note 43 (b) and Note 2(xv)
f)	
Measurement of lease liabilities and Right-of-use asset - Refer Note 4, Note 35 and Note 2(xii)
g)	
Measurement defined benefit obligation - Refer Note 38 and Note 2(xi)
h)	
Provisions and contingencies, including Royalty - Refer Note 43 (a) and Note 2(xviii)
Estimates and judgements are continuously evaluated. They are based on historical experience and other factors, 
including expectations of future events that may have a financial impact on the Group.  The estimates and 
judgments made by the management are believed to be reasonable under the prevailing circumstances.                      
ii.	
Revenue from operations
The core principle of Ind AS 115 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers is that an entity should recognise revenue to 
depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which 
the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Further the standard requires enhanced 
disclosures about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from the entity’s 
contract with customers. 
Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised when control of services is transferred to the customer at an 
amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for those services Revenue 
towards satisfaction of a performance obligation is measured at the amount of transaction price (net of variable 
consideration) allocated to that performance obligation. The transaction price of services rendered is net of variable 
232

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
consideration on account of discounts, volume rebate and any taxes or duties collected on behalf of the government 
which are levied on revenue such as Goods and Services tax (GST).
The Group provides radio advertising services and Media Solutions to the clients. The Group also earns subscription 
revenue through the Gaana App. 
The Group classifies its media solutions as under:
i.	
Branded Solutions: The Group provides various branded services which include Concerts, Award Shows, On-Air 
properties, Brand Licensing, Multimedia and Digital services.
ii.	
Managed Solutions: The Group provides services to manage the intellectual properties, activities or events of 
Clients.
Revenue from Radio Broadcasting and other services 
a.	
Revenue from radio broadcasting is recognised on an accrual basis on the airing of client’s commercials at a point 
in time.  
b.	
Revenue from solutions business is recognised, in the period in which the performance obligations are satisfied.
c.	
Revenue from subscription is recognised in the period in which the performance obligations are satisfied.
Contract balances 
Contract assets
A contract asset is the right to consideration in exchange for services transferred to the customer. Contract assets are 
recognised when there is excess of revenue earned over billings on contracts. Contract assets are classified as unbilled 
revenues (only act of invoicing is pending) when there is unconditional right to receive cash, and only passage of time 
is required, as per contractual terms.
Trade receivables
A receivable represents the Groups’s right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional (i.e., only the passage of 
time is required before payment of the consideration is due or payments are already due but yet to be realized). 
Contract Liability
A contract liability is the obligation to transfer services to a customer for which the Group has received consideration 
(or an amount of consideration is due) from the customer. Contract liabilities are recognised as revenue when the Group 
satisfies its performance obligation under the contract. Unearned and deferred revenue is recognised when there are 
billings in excess of revenues.
The Group disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers by the nature of services it provides to the customer.
The billing schedules agreed with customers include periodic performance based payments. Invoices are payable within 
contractually agreed credit period.
Use of significant judgements in revenue recognition
a.	
The Group’s contracts with customers could include promises to transfer multiple services to a customer. The 
Group assesses the services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract. 
Identification of distinct performance obligation involves judgement to determine the deliverables and the ability 
of the customer to benefit independently from such deliverables.
b.	
Judgement is also required to determine the transaction price for the contract. The transaction price could be 
either a fixed amount of customer consideration or variable consideration with elements such as volume rebates 
and discount. Any consideration payable to the customer is adjusted to the transaction price, unless it is a payment 
for a distinct product or service from the customer. The estimated amount of variable consideration is adjusted 
in the transaction price only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of 
cumulative revenue recognised will not occur and is reassessed at the end of each reporting period. The Group 
allocates the elements of variable considerations to all the performance obligations of the contract unless there is 
observable evidence that they pertain to one or more distinct performance obligations.
c.	
The Group uses judgement to determine an appropriate standalone selling price for a performance obligation. 
Annual Report 2023-24
233
Corporate Overview
Statutory Reports
Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
The Group allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation on the basis of the relative stand-alone 
selling price of each distinct product or service promised in the contract. 
d.	
The Group exercises judgement in determining whether the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time 
or over a period of time. The Group considers indicators such as how customer consumes benefits as services are 
rendered or existence of enforceable right to payment for performance to date and alternate use of such service, 
transfer of significant risks and rewards to the customer, acceptance of delivery by the customer, etc.
iii.	
Other Income   
a.	
Dividends, if any are recognised in statement of profit and loss only when:
i)	
the right to receive payment is established;
ii)	
it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the dividend will flow to the Group; and 
iii)	
the amount of the dividend can be measured reliably.
b.	
Interest income from financial assets is recognised using the effective interest rate method. The effective interest 
rate is the rate that discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to the 
gross carrying amount of a financial asset. When calculating the effective interest rate, the Group estimates the 
expected cash flows by considering all the contractual terms of the financial instrument but does not consider the 
expected credit losses. 
iv.	
Principles of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries as at 
March 31, 2024. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement 
with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Specifically, the Group 
controls an investee if and only if the Group has:
a.	
Power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the 
investee).
b.	
Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee, and
c.	
The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns.
The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes 
to one or more of the three elements of control. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control 
over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses 
of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements from the 
date the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the following basis: 
	
The financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries have been combined on a line-by-line basis by adding 
together the reported values of like items of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. 
	
Intra-group balances and intra-group transactions and resulting profits are eliminated in full. 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and 
other events in similar circumstances and are presented to the extent possible in the same manner as the Company’s 
separate financial statements.
v.	
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment are stated at acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if 
any. Cost of Property, plant and equipment comprises purchase price, duties, levies (excluding input tax credit) and any 
directly attributable cost of bringing the asset to its working condition and location for the intended use.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only 
when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the 
item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to statement of profit and loss during the 
reporting period in which they are incurred. The carrying amount of any component accounted for as a separate asset is 
234
Entertainment Network (India) Limited
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
derecognised when replaced. The present value of the expected cost for the decommissioning of an asset (after its use) 
is included in the cost of the respective asset if the recognition criteria for a provision are met.
Cost incurred on Property, plant and equipment not ready for their intended use is disclosed as Capital Work-in-
Progress. Advances paid towards the acquisition of Property, Plant and Equipment outstanding at each balance sheet 
date are classified as capital advances under other non-current assets. Unpaid amounts towards acquisition of Property, 
Plant and Equipment outstanding at each balance sheet date are classified under other current financial liabilities if 
due within one year from the date of these consolidated financial statements and under other non-current financial 
liabilities if due after a year from the date of these consolidated financial statements. 
Depreciation on Property, Plant and Equipment other than leasehold improvements, is provided on written down value 
(WDV) method as per the useful life and in the manner specified in schedule II to the Act. Leasehold improvements are 
depreciated on straight line basis, over the lease period.
The estimated useful lives used by the Group to compute depreciation is as under:

An item of Property, Plant & Equipment is derecognised upon disposal and any gain or loss arising on derecognition 
of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is 
included in the statement of profit and loss when the asset is derecognised. Assets to be disposed off are reported at 
the lower of the carrying value or the fair value less cost to sell.
vi.	
Intangible assets 
a.	
Frequency Module (FM) Radio Licenses
Non-Refundable One Time Migration Fee paid by the Group for existing FM Radio licenses upon migration to 
Phase III of the Licensing policy and Non-Refundable One Time Entry Fee paid by the Group for acquiring new 
FM radio licenses have been capitalised as an intangible asset. These assets are stated at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and impairment losses, if applicable.
A summary of amortisation policies applied to the licenses is tabulated below:
Asset class

The amortisation period and the amortisation method for finite-life intangible assets is reviewed at each financial 
year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.
b.	
Software
a.	
Software acquired initially together with hardware is capitalised along with the cost of hardware and 
depreciated in the same manner as the hardware. All subsequent purchases of software licenses are treated 
as revenue expenditure and charged to the statement of profit and loss account in the year of purchase.

Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
b.	
Expenditure on Enterprise Software such as SAP, Sales CRM and Performance Appraisal Software etc. where 
the economic benefit is expected to be more than a year is recognised as an “Intangible Asset” and are 
amortised over a period of 45 to 60 months.  
vii.	 Investment properties
Investment in buildings that is not intended to be occupied substantially for use by, or in the operations of the Group, 
have been classified as investment property. Investment properties are measured initially at cost, including 
transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties are stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and accumulated impairment loss, if any. All repairs and maintenance costs incurred for the investment 
properties are charged to statement of profit and loss account when incurred.
Investment properties are depreciated using the written down value method over their estimated useful lives. Investment 
properties generally have a useful life of 60 years.
Though the Group measures investment property using cost based measurement, the fair value of investment property 
is disclosed in the notes (Refer note 7). Fair values are determined based on an annual evaluation performed by a 
registered valuer. If at the balance sheet date there is an indication that a previously assessed impairment loss no 
longer exists, the recoverable amount is reassessed and the asset is reflected at the recoverable amount subject to a 
maximum of depreciated historical carrying value.
Investment properties are derecognised either when they have been disposed of or when they are permanently 
withdrawn from use and no future economic benefit is expected from their disposal. The difference between the net 
disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset is recognised in profit or loss in the period of derecognition.
viii.	 Borrowing cost
Borrowing cost directly attributable to qualifying assets, which take substantial period to get ready for its intended 
use, are capitalized to the extent they relate to the period until such assets are ready to be put to use. Other borrowing 
costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred. The Group is debt free and hence there 
are non-borrowing cost.
ix.	
Foreign currency transactions 
Foreign currency transactions are recorded at the exchange rates prevailing on the date of the transaction. Gains and 
losses arising out of subsequent fluctuations are accounted for on actual payment or realisation. Monetary items 
denominated in foreign currency as at the balance sheet date are converted at the exchange rates prevailing on that 
day. Exchange differences are recognised in the statement of profit and loss.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange 
rates at the dates of the initial transactions. 
Assets and liabilities of entities with functional currency other than the functional currency of the Company have been 
translated using exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Statement of profit and loss of such entities 
has been translated using weighted average exchange rates. Translation adjustments have been recognised in Other 
Comprehensive Income in the statement of Profit and Loss and reported as foreign currency translation reserve in the 
statement of changes in equity.
x.	
Financial instruments
a.	
Recognition and initial measurement	
	
The Group recognizes trade receivables and trade payables when they are originated at transaction price. All other 
financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions 
of the instrument. All financial assets and liabilities are recognised at fair value. In case of financial assets and 
liabilities that are not measured at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs are added 
to the fair value on initial recognition. 	
	
b.	
Classification and subsequent measurement
i.	
Financial assets 
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:
	
those to be measured at fair value through profit or loss; and
	
those measured at amortised cost.
236
Entertainment Network (India) Limited
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
The classification depends on the Group’s business model for managing the financial assets and the 
contractual terms of the cash flows.
Investments that are intended to be held for not more than a year from the date of investment are classified 
as current investments. All other investments are termed as non-current investments. The portion of non-
current investments which is expected to be realized within twelve months from the balance sheet date are 
classified as current investments.
Realised and unrealised gains/ losses arising from changes in the fair value of the “financial assets at fair 
value through profit or loss” investment category are included in the statement of profit and loss in the period 
in which they arise.
ii.	
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rates method. For 
trade and other payables, the carrying amounts represents the fair value due to the short maturity of these 
instruments.
Realised and unrealised gains/ losses arising from changes in the fair value of the “financial liabilities at fair 
value through profit or loss” are included in the statement of profit and loss in the period in which they arise.	
	
	
c.	
Derecognition of financial instruments
The Group derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset 
expire or it transfers the financial asset and the transfer qualifies for derecognition under Ind AS 109- ‘Financial 
Instruments’. A financial liability (or part of a financial liability) is derecognised from the Group’s Balance Sheet when 
the obligation specified in the contract is discharged or cancelled or expires.	
	
	
d.	
Impairment of financial assets
The Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its assets carried at 
amortised cost. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase 
in the credit risk.
For trade receivables, the Group applies the simplified approach permitted by Ind AS 109- ‘Financial Instruments’, 
which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables. Lifetime 
losses are the expected credit losses resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of a trade 
receivables.
The Group uses a provision matrix to determine impairment loss allowance on portfolio of its trade receivables. The 
provision matrix is based on its historically observed default rates over the expected life of the trade receivables 
and is adjusted for forward-looking estimates. Every year, the historical observed default rates are updated and 
changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed.
xi.	
Employee benefits
a.	
Defined Contribution Plans:	
The Group has defined contribution plans for post-employment benefits such as Provident Fund, National Pension 
Scheme, Employee’s State Insurance and Employee’s Pension Scheme, 1995. The Group contributes to a government 
administered Provident Fund, state plan namely Employee’s Pension Scheme, 1995, Employee State Insurance 
Scheme and National Pension Scheme on behalf of its employees and has no further obligation beyond making its 
contribution.	
	
The Group’s contributions to the above funds are recognised in the statement of profit and loss every year.	
b.	
Defined Benefit Plans:
 The Group provides for gratuity benefit, which is a defined benefit plan, covering all its eligible employees. 
Liability for defined benefit plans is provided based on valuations, as at the balance sheet date, carried out by an 
independent actuary. The actuarial valuation method used by the independent actuary for measuring the liability 
is the projected unit credit method.

Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
Actuarial losses and gains are recognised in other comprehensive income and shall not be reclassified to the 
statement of profit and loss in a subsequent period. 
Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation resulting from plan amendments or curtailments are 
recognised immediately in the statement of profit and loss as past service costs. 
The Code on Social Security, 2020 (“the Code”) relating to employee benefits during employment and post-
employment benefits received Presidential assent in September 2020. The Code has been published in the Gazette 
of India. However, the date on which the Code will come into effect has not been notified and the final rules/ 
interpretation have not yet been issued. The Group will assess the impact of the Code when it comes into effect 
and will record any related impact in the period the Code becomes effective.
c.	
Other long term benefits
The Group has other long term benefits namely compensated absences for all its employees. The liabilities in 
respect of compensated absences which are expected to be encashed / utilised within twelve months from the 
balance sheet date are current. Other such liabilities are considered non-current.
d.	
Termination benefits are recognised as an expense as and when incurred.
xii.	 Leases
The Group assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract conveys the 
right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for a consideration.
	
Group as a lessee
The Group applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and 
leases of low-value assets. The Group recognises lease liabilities in respect of future lease payments and Right of Use 
assets representing the right to use the underlying assets.
i)	
Right of Use assets
The Group recognises Right of Use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the underlying 
asset is available for use). Right of Use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and 
impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of Right of Use assets includes 
the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the 
commencement date less any lease incentives received. Right of Use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis 
over the lease term.
ii)	
Lease liabilities
The Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease 
term. The lease payments include fixed payments less any lease incentives receivable. 
In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate at the lease 
commencement date or April 1, 2019 whichever is later. After the commencement date, the amount of lease 
liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, 
the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification or a change in the lease term or a 
change in the lease payments.
iii)	
Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets 
The Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its leases that have a lease term of 12 months or 
less and leases of low value assets. The Group recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as an 
expense in the statement of Profit and loss.
iv)	
Termination/Modification of lease
The gain or loss arising from termination shall be determined as the difference between the carrying value of 
lease liability, and the carrying amount of right of use asset. It shall be recognised in statement of profit and loss 
when the asset is derecognised. 
For a lease modification that is not accounted for as a separate lease, the Group accounts for the remeasurement 
238
Entertainment Network (India) Limited
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
of the lease liability by: 
(a)	
decreasing the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset to reflect the partial or full termination of the lease 
for lease modifications that decrease the scope of the lease. The Group recognises in profit or loss any gain 
or loss relating to the partial or full termination of the lease. 
(b)	
making a corresponding adjustment to the right-of-use asset for all other lease modifications.
xiii.	 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, demand deposits with banks and other short-term highly liquid 
investments with original maturities of three months or less. Bank overdrafts, if any are shown as borrowings under 
current financial liabilities in the balance sheet.
xiv.	 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit or loss for the period attributable to equity shareholders 
by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period. The weighted average number of equity 
shares outstanding during the period and for all periods presented is adjusted for events (such as bonus shares),if 
any, other than the conversion of potential equity shares that have changed the number of equity shares outstanding 
without a corresponding change in resources. For calculating diluted earnings per share, the net profit or loss for the 
period attributable to equity shareholders and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period 
are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares.
xv.	
Taxes
Tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current income tax and deferred tax are measured based on the 
amount expected to be paid to the tax authorities in accordance with the Income Tax Act, 1961.
Current Tax
Current tax in the Statement of Profit and Loss is provided as the amount of tax payable in respect of taxable income 
for the period using tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) 
MAT paid in accordance with tax laws which give rise to future economic benefits in the form of adjustment to future 
income tax liability is considered as an asset, if there is convincing evidence that the Group will pay normal tax in future. 
Accordingly, MAT is recognised as a deferred tax asset in the balance sheet when it is probable that the future economic 
benefit associated with it will flow to the Group and the asset can be measured reliably. The Group reviews the ‘Minimum 
Alternate Tax (MAT) Credit Entitlement’ asset at each reporting date and writes down the asset to the extent the Group 
does not have convincing evidence that it will pay normal tax during the specified period i.e. the period for which MAT 
credit is allowed to be carried forward.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets 
and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred tax assets are recognised 
only to the extent that there is reasonable certainty that sufficient future taxable income will be available against which 
such deferred tax assets can be realised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there 
is an intention to settle the asset and the liability on a net basis.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. 
Unrecognised deferred tax assets, if any are re-assessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it 
has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Current and deferred tax is recognised in the statement of profit and loss, except to the extent that it relates to the items 
recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In such situations, the tax is also recognised in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity, as the case may be.

xvi.	 GST paid on acquisition of assets or on incurring expenses
Expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of GST, except
a.	
When the tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which 
case, the tax paid is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item, as 
applicable.
b.	
The net amount of tax receivable/ payable is included as part of receivables/payables, as the case may be, in the 
balance sheet. 
xvii.	 Impairment of non-financial assets
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is any indication that a non-financial asset, other than 
goodwill, may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of such asset.  If 
recoverable amount of such asset or the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs is 
less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable amount. The reduction is treated as an 
impairment loss and is recognised in the statement of profit and loss. If at the balance sheet date there is an indication 
that a previously assessed impairment loss no longer exists, the recoverable amount is reassessed and the asset is 
reflected at the recoverable amount subject to a maximum of depreciated historical carrying value.
Goodwill if any, is not subject to amortisation and is tested for impairment at each reporting date. An impairment loss 
recognised for goodwill shall not be reversed in a subsequent period.
xviii.	Provisions and contingent liabilities
The Group recognises a provision when there is a present obligation as a result of a past event that probably requires 
an outflow of resources and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are determined 
based on best estimates of the amount required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date. These are reviewed 
at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimates. If the effect of time value of money 
is material, provisions are discounted. The discount rate used to determine the present value is a pre-tax rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The increase in the 
provision due to the passage of time is recognised as interest expense. 
A disclosure for a contingent liability is made when there is a possible obligation or a present obligation that may, but 
probably will not, require an outflow of resources embodying economic benefit. Where there is a possible obligation or 
a present obligation that the likelihood of outflow of resources is remote, no provision or disclosure is made.
xix.	 Dividends 
Final dividend on shares is recorded as a liability on the date of approval by the shareholders and interim dividend is 
recorded as a liability on the date of approval by the Group’s Board of Directors.
xx.	
License Fees 
As per the applicable Frequency Module (FM) broadcasting policy, license fees is recognised in statement of profit and 
loss at the rate of 4% of gross revenue or minimum fixed fee for the concerned city, whichever is higher. Minimum fixed 
fee is 2.5% of the Non-Refundable One Time Entry Fee (NOTEF). 
However, for the first three years of operations in the states of North East (i.e. Assam and Meghalaya) and Jammu & 
Kashmir the rate of License fee was 2% of Gross Revenue or 1.25% of NOTEF, whichever is higher.
Gross Revenue for this purpose shall mean revenue on the basis of billing rates inclusive of any taxes. Barter advertising 
contracts are also included in the gross revenue on the basis of relevant billing rates. NOTEF means the successful bid 
amount arrived at through an ascending e-auction process for private FM Radio Phase-III Channels conducted by the 
Ministry of Information & Broadcasting (‘MIB’).

ii)	
Standards issued / amended and became effective
The Ministry of Corporate Affairs has notified Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2023 
dated March 31, 2023, to amend the following Ind AS which are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 
April 1, 2023. The Group has applied for the first-time these amendments.
a)	
Disclosure of Accounting Policies - Amendments to Ind AS 1
The amendments aim to help entities provide accounting policy disclosures that are more useful by replacing 
the requirement for entities to disclose their ‘significant’ accounting policies with a requirement to disclose 
their ‘material’ accounting policies and adding guidance on how entities apply the concept of materiality in 
making decisions about accounting policy disclosures. The amendments have had an impact on the Group’s 
disclosures of accounting policies, but not on the measurement, recognition or presentation of any items in 
the Group’s standalone financial statements.
b)	
Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction - Amendments to Ind AS 12
The amendments narrow the scope of the initial recognition exception under Ind AS 12, so that it no longer 
applies to transactions that give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences such as leases.
The Group does have leases and it continues to disclose deferred tax asset.
This amendment did not have any material impact on the amounts recognised in prior periods and do not 
affect the current period or are expected to significantly affect future periods.
c)	
Definition of Accounting Estimates - Amendments to Ind AS 8
The amendments clarify the distinction between changes in accounting estimates and changes in accounting 
policies and the correction of errors. It has also been clarified how entities use measurement techniques and 
inputs to develop accounting estimates.

While disclosing the aggregate amount of transaction price yet to be recognised as revenue towards unsatisfied (or partially 
satisfied) performance obligations, along with the broad time band for the expected time to recognise those revenues, the 
Group has applied the practical expedient in Ind AS 115 as unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligation are parts 
of contracts that have an original expected duration of one year or less. Accordingly, the Group has not disclosed the aggregate 
transaction price allocated to unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations which pertain to contracts where 
revenue recognised corresponds to the value transferred to customer typically involving time and material, outcome based and 
event based contracts.

35.	 DISCLOSURE AS PER IND AS 116
The Group, at the inception of a contract, assesses the contract as, or containing, a lease if the contract conveys the right 
to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract 
conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset: 
	
the Group assesses whether the contract involves the use of an identified asset, 
	
the Group has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset throughout the period 
of use; and 
	
the Group has the right to direct the use of the asset. 
The Group has lease contracts for offices premises and transmission facilities used in its operations. Leases of transmission 
facilities generally have a lease term ranging from 2 to 15 years, while office premises generally have lease terms ranging 
from 2 to 10 years.
The Group has also applied the available practical expedients wherein it:
1.	
Used a single discounting rate to a portfolio of leases with reasonably same characteristics.
2.	
Applied short term leases exemptions to leases with lease term that ends within 12 months at the date on initial 
application.
3.	
Excluded the initial direct cost from the measurement of the Right of use of asset at the date of initial application.
Lease Liabilities
The Group recognised a lease liability measured at the present value of all the remaining lease payments, discounted using 
the Group’s incremental borrowing rate.
The Group’s non-current lease liabilities are included in Non-current financial liabilities (Refer note 20) and current lease 
liabilities are included in Other current financial liabilities (Refer note 22). The maturity analysis of lease liabilities is 
disclosed in note 46 – Financial Risk Management

Right of Use Asset
For new lease contracts, the Group recognises a Right of Use asset and a corresponding lease liability with respect to all 
lease agreements in which it is the lessee. The lease liability and the Right of Use assets is initially measured at the present 
value of remaining lease payments, discounted using the incremental borrowing rate at the date of recognition. Depreciation 
is computed using straight-line method over the lease term. The Group’s Right of Use assets were recognised and shown 
separately in the Balance Sheet (Refer Note 4).

Defined Benefit Plans
Post-employment obligations
Employees who are in continuous service for a period of 5 years or death while in employment are eligible for gratuity. 
The amount of gratuity payable on retirement/termination is the employees last drawn basic salary per month 
computed proportionately for 15 days’ salary multiplied for the number of years of service. The liability in respect of 
gratuity is uncapped and is not restricted to ` 20 lakhs.
These plans typically expose the Group to actuarial risks such as interest risk and salary inflation risk.
a)	
Interest risk - A decrease in the discount rate will increase the plan liability.
b)	
Salary inflation risk – The present value of the defined plan liability is calculated by reference to the future 
salaries of plan participants. As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the plan’s 
liability.
In accordance with Ind AS 19, actuarial valuation was done in respect of the aforesaid Defined Benefit Plan of gratuity 
(unfunded) based on the following assumptions:

Other Litigation
During the current year, in the matter of the Company vs Phonographic Performance Limited (‘PPL’), the Hon’ble Madras 
High Court partly allowed the appeal of PPL. The management is in the process of filing a special leave petition before

generally met through internal accruals.   
The net debt of the Group as at March 31, 2024 is Nil (March 31, 2023- Nil).
45.	 FAIR VALUE
The fair values of financial assets and liabilities are included at the amount at which the instrument can be exchanged in a

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values:
a.	
Fair value of cash and cash equivalents, other bank balances, trade and other current financial assets, trade and other 
payables approximate their carrying amounts due to the short maturities of these instruments. The fair value of the 
financial assets and liabilities is included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current 
transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.
b.	
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by 
valuation technique:
Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities – Investment in Mutual funds
Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, 
either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: techniques which use inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on 
observable market data.

deposits, investment in mutual funds, trade and other receivables, and cash and cash equivalents that derive directly from 
its operations.

credit risks, market risks, and liquidity risks. This note explains the sources of risk which the entity is exposed to and how 
the entity manages the risks in the financial statements.

largely independent markets. 
The Group uses the expected credit loss model as per Ind AS 109 – ‘Financial Instruments’ to assess the impairment 
loss. The Group uses a provision matrix to compute the expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables. The 
provision matrix considers available external and internal credit risk factors and the Group’s historical experience in 
respect of customers. The maximum exposure, to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of 
financial assets disclosed in Note 13.

the said accounting software to log any direct data changes on account of recommendation in the accounting software 
administration guide which states that enabling the same all the time consume storage space on the disk and can impact 
database performance significantly. The users of the Group Company do not have any access to database Ids with DML (Data 
Manipulation Language) authority which can make direct data changes (create, change, delete) at database level. Audit trail
