Business Responsibility & 
Sustainability Report
Dear Stakeholders,
I am pleased to bring to you our inaugural Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) in compliance with the requirements of SEBI 
for Top 1000 listed companies in India, by market capitalization. While ESG (Environment, Social and Governance) may be a new technical jargon, 
the essence of ESG has always been ingrained in our organisation’s culture and way of business.
Governance at the Center of Operations
We have always considered governance at the forefront of all our activities. This year, with the listing of our Company, we fortified the resilience 
of our processes, controls and the overall governance structure. We instated the Audit Committee, Nomination and Remuneration Committee, 
Stakeholders Relationship Committee, and Risk Management Committee this year through a Board resolution dated July 14, 2023. Various 
members of the Board, key-managerial personnel and other senior managerial personnel have been tasked with leading matters on regulatory 
compliances, occupational health and safety, human resource management and development, risk management, IT security and controls, 
amongst other sustainability linked matters. Our risk management plan includes identification of sustainability-linked risks and impacts, to 
orchestrate effective mitigation and control activities.
Our People, our Strength
As at the end of this financial year, our Company employed upwards of 9,000 employees and workers, including contract workers. It gives me 
immense pride to add that more than 50% of these employees and workers are females. The Company also employed 25+ differently abled 
workers, who are given an equal access to work and growth opportunities. With another facility in construction at Umbergaon, we only hope to 
add to this number.
The safety of our people has been of utmost priority to us, and the Company has made significant investments in developing infrastructure, 
housed with all the necessary safety equipment and a dedicated HSE team to lead health and safety initiatives. The Company has an inhouse 
‘Occupational Health Center’ for onsite injuries and health check-ups. Further, the Company, through its Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives 
is funding the construction of a hospital in Umbergaon.
Environmental Stewardship
We strive to ensure efficient management of waste with minimal impact on adjoining ecosystems in the regions in which we operate. We have 
taken various steps towards conservation of environment and making judicious use of natural resources. We are further exploring different 
projects to extend our stewardship on environmental matters and contribute positively to climate action.
Sustainable growth has been the driving force of our vision. We aspire to and shall continually strive to create value for our stakeholders, in a 
manner that is ethical, fair and environmentally-conscious.
Warm Regards,
Santosh Raveshia
Managing Director

services or for non-fulfilment of our obligations, and DOMS only acted as an intermediary to get these complaints resolved.

Emission and 
Climate Change
Risk
Our primary operations are 
situated at Umbergaon which 
is in close proximity to the 
coastline. Hence, the place is 
exposed to extreme weather 
conditions, rising water levels 
and rising temperatures.
The Company has inhouse ventilation, 
drainage and fire hydrant systems to 
protect against extreme events.
The Company also practices rainwater 
harvesting to restore ground water 
levels in the vicinity.
The Company is also insured against 
losses due to extreme weather events.

Conservation
Risk
While our processes are not 
water intensive, we use water 
primarily for cooling, cleaning 
and domestic use. We are 
dependent on municipal 
water and groundwater 
bores for fulfilling our water 
requirements. Any shortage of 
water could have an adverse 
impact on our operations
We practice rainwater harvesting at our 
Umbergaon facility, using a catchment 
pond. The harvested water is directed 
to refill groundwater bores and 
replenish our fire hydrant tanks.
We have further installed ETPs at 
relevant sites for treatment of water 
discharged through our processes. The 
treated water is reused in operations. 
We are also in the process of installing 
an STP to treat all water discharge from 
domestic use.
We further reuse water used for 
cleaning and cooling to limit our water 
withdrawal to the extent possible.

course of work.
We have developed elaborate safety 
protocols, led by a dedicated HSE team.
Our premises are equipped with health 
and safety equipment for preventive 
and corrective control.

of paramount importance 
and can lead to increasing 
productivity levels and 
improved staff morale.
All employees and workers are provided 
on-field training during the course of 
work. Unskilled workers are provided 
special trainings upon meeting specific 
performance-based criteria. Annual

Risk: Like all other businesses, 
we are susceptible to 
negligence or override of 
controls due to human errors 
or conflicts. It may lead to 
non-compliance, damage 
to environment or loss of 
business.
Opportunity: However, with 
sound governance practices, 
we can further improve our 
business results. High levels 
of integrity can improve work 
culture and positively impact 
employee morale.
Our risk management plan addresses all 
material risks, including sustainability 
risks. Relevant policies, checks and 
controls have been implemented to 
prevent non-compliance or misuse of

Type of waste
Process
Plastic Waste
Post-consumer Plastic Waste
In line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) norms applicable to our Company, we have tied up with a 
registered third-party Plastic Waste Processor (PWP) for collection of post-consumer plastic wastes on our behalf.
Plastic waste so collected is suitably recycled and the Company is granted ‘Certificate of Recycling’ to this extent.
Pre-consumer Plastic Waste
The Company re-uses most of its polymer-based waste generated in its manufacturing processes. Many of its plastic-
based drums are also sent back to the suppliers after use. The remaining plastic scrap is sold to plastic scrap dealers 
who further recycle the product. 
Electronic Waste
E-waste generated as a result of our operations is either reused internally or sold to third-party vendors that manage 
the waste suitably.
Hazardous 
Waste
Waste water is treated through inhouse ETP plants. Residual waste is collected by authorized vendors for proper 
disposal. All hazardous wastes are being disposed as per the Hazardous Wastes Management Rules.
Sawdust
The Company recycles sawdust from processing of wood-based products to produce wood briquettes. These 
briquettes are used for heating (as a replacement to other forms of fuel/energy) and the balance are sold off to dealers 
for resale. 
Others
Other waste, including scrap cardboard, paper-based waste or metal scraps are disposed off to scrap dealers for 
recycling and disposal.

Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity.
	
The Company has introduced ‘Stakeholder Engagement Policy’ which identifies stakeholders that impact or are impacted by our operations 
or existence. It also outlines our responsibilities and methods of engagement towards each of these stakeholders.
	
The Company also conducted a Materiality Assessment, wherein different stakeholders were identified based on the following parameters:
	
i.	
Dependency - direct or indirect effect of the Company’s products, services, activities, or performance on the stakeholder 
group; or vice versa.
	
ii.	
Responsibility - whether the Company is directly or indirectly accountable to the stakeholder group.
	
iii.	
Influence - whether the Company directly or indirectly influences or impacts the group’s interests, performance or 
existence; or vice versa.
	
Basis the above assessment, the following groups were identified as stakeholders of the Company: shareholders, investors, directors, 
employees, workers, suppliers, super stockiest, distributors and retailers, consumers, regulators & government authorities, industry 
associations and local communities.

Do you have a focal point (Individual/ Committee) responsible for addressing human rights impacts or issues caused or contributed to 
by the business? (Yes/No)
	
Yes. The Company has an ‘Internal Complaints Committee’ that handles human rights complaints, including complaints on sexual 
harassment. The Committee comprises of four persons, including an external consultant and is presided by a senior female employee. 
Further, employees or workers are encouraged to communicate any grievances to their respective supervisors or the HR department.
5.	
Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues.
	
The Committee addresses grievances related to human rights issues using the following two mechanisms:
	
i.	
Resolution through conciliation
	
	
If any complaint is received by stakeholders, before initiating the inquiry, the Committee if requested by the aggrieved person shall 
undertake necessary steps to conciliate the complaint between the complainant and the person/s against whom the complaint is filed.
	
ii.	
Resolution through formal inquiry
 
 
In case of a formal inquiry, the Committee members hear the complainant and record the allegations. The complainant may also 
submit corroborative material to substantiate the complaint.
 
 
The Committee members investigate the matter, which may include inquiring with the person/s against whom the complaint is 
filed, collecting evidence through witnesses and involving such other persons for conducting tasks relevant to the investigation.
 
 
The Committee provides every reasonable opportunity to the complainant and the person/s against whom the complaint is filed 
for putting forward and defending their respective case. 
 
 
While conducting the inquiry, a minimum of three Committee members including the Presiding Officer are present. The 
employer is required to provide all necessary assistance for the purpose of ensuring full, effective and speedy implementation 
of the policy. 
 
 
Where violation occurs as a result of an act or omission by any third party or outsider, the Company shall take all necessary 
steps and reasonable to assist the affected person in terms of support and preventive action.
 
 
The inquiry is completed with submission of the Inquiry Report, within 90 days from the date on which the inquiry is 
commenced and relevant disciplinary action is taken by the employer. The inquiry procedure is conducted with absolute fairness 
to all parties.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If yes, then provide details.
	
The Company has undertaken the following activities to reduce its Green House Gas Emissions:
	
i.	
Wood Briquettes as a ‘biofuel’: Wooden pencils contribute to about 35% of the Company’s overall sales. In the process of 
manufacturing these pencils, the Company collects a large amount of sawdust, a combination of leftover wood shavings and lead. The 
Company recycles the sawdust into briquettes, using its wood briquettes production plant. The briquettes so generated have a high 
calorific value and help the Company substitute other fuels for heating in its furnace.
	
ii.	
Use of cultivated wood: Defying the conventional perception, all wooden slats used in the production of wooden pencils are sourced 
through cultivated plantations and not through elimination of forest cover. Cultivation of these trees leads to negative greenhouse gas 
emissions or in other words, helps absorb CO2 till the trees are ready for harvest.
	
iii.	
Renewable energy sources: The Company is evaluating use of renewable energy sources such as use of solar energy at some of its 
sites at Umbergaon.

At DOMS, we have built a conscious culture to reduce waste as much as possible. Our manufacturing processes are designed in a way that 
ensure maximum use of raw materials, and reconditioning of leftover materials for reuse in processes.
