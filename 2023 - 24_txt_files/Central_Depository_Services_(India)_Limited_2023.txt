Social 
Responsibility 
towards 
Society
O
CDSL through its Corporate Social 
Responsibility (CSR) programmes 
endeavours to enrich the lives of the 
citizens of this country. CDSL believes 
that a nation progresses when 
its communities are empowered. 
Extending this belief to our Corporate 
Social 
Initiatives, 
we 
remain 
committed to enriching the lives of 
the citizens of India. Our vision is to 
create a world in which everyone can 
thrive through social, environmental, 
and economic progress. We reached 
out to the socially and economically 
disadvantaged 
communities 
in 
association with 10 CSR partners in 
FY 2023-24. CDSL focused on health, 
education, environment, and research 
to leave a visible impact.

Data Security
R&O
Privacy and data security present a 
significant risk for CDSL, especially 
considering 
the 
increasing 
digitisation 
of 
financial 
services 
and the growth in the number of 
digital users. As more transactions 
and sensitive information are being 
exchanged digitally, the risk of cyber 
threats and unauthorised access 
to privileged information becomes 
increasingly prominent. Any breach 
in data security could result in severe 
consequences, 
including 
financial 
loss, 
reputational 
damage, 
legal 
implications, and loss of trust from 
stakeholders.
To address the risk of privacy and data 
security, CDSL can implement several 
measures: 
Robust 
Information 
Security 
Infrastructure: CDSL invests in advanced 
software solutions, firewalls, encryption 
techniques, and intrusion detection systems 
to create a secure environment for data 
storage and transmission. This infrastructure 
should be regularly updated and tested to 
ensure its effectiveness against emerging 
cyber threats. 
Expert Manpower: CDSL employs a team 
of skilled professionals with expertise 
in information security to continuously 
monitor and respond to potential threats. 
These experts should be well-versed in the 
latest security practices, industry standards, 
and regulations to ensure the implementation 
of effective security measures. 
Training 
and 
Awareness: 
Conducting 
regular training sessions and awareness 
programmes for employees, clients, and 
other stakeholders is vital. These initiatives 
should focus on educating them about best 
practices for data security, including strong 
password 
management, 
safe 
browsing 
habits, and identifying potential phishing 
attempts or social engineering attacks.

the Claimant, mis-utilised the securities belonging to the

on a variety of issues, allowing the Company to better understand its stakeholders’ concerns and expectations.
Furthermore, the Company has established a reporting mechanism to provide feedback from these consultations to the
