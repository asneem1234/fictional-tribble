Human 
Capital & 
Labour 
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Ineffective human 
capital and Labour 
management practices 
can lead to significant 
risks, such as high turnover 
rates, Labour disputes, 
decreased productivity, etc. 
These issues can increase 
recruitment and training 
costs, cause operational 
disruptions, and damage 
the Company’s reputation, 
ultimately resulting in 
substantial financial 
losses. Additionally, non-
compliance with Labour 
laws can result in legal 
penalties.
Opportunity: Content 
and well-trained human 
capital would boost 
productivity and operational 
performance, while excellent 
Labour practices would 
attract high-quality talent, 
providing a competitive 
edge. Engaged and satisfied 
employees also drive 
innovation and contribute 
significantly to business 
growth.
At Campus, we are highly 
focused on supporting 
and developing our 
employees Here’s 
a summary of our 
initiatives:
1.	 Training Programs: 
Offering training 
programs to enhance 
skills and knowledge 
among employees.
2.	 Job Evaluations: 
Conducting job 
evaluations to 
ensure roles and 
responsibilities are 
aligned with employee 
strengths and 
company needs.
3.	 Career Development 
for High-Potential 
Managers: 
Focusing on career 
development to help 
managers reach their 
potential and prepare 
for future leadership 
roles.
4.	 ESOP Plans: 
Implementing 
Employee Stock 
Ownership Plans to 
give employees a 
stake in the company’s 
success and motivate 
them.
These initiatives are 
designed to not only 
engage and retain 
employees but also 
to motivate and 
reward them for their 
contributions.
Positive: Optimal 
investment in human 
capital and Labour 
management enhances 
efficiency by aligning 
employees with roles 
that maximize their 
performance, leading to 
increased productivity, 
reduced turnover costs, 
and better financial 
performance.
Negative: Challenges 
such as decreased 
productivity, increased 
turnover costs, and 
frequent operational 
disruptions can 
negatively affect 
financial performance, 
raise recruitment and 
training expenses, and 
ultimately lower the 
overall profitability of the 
Company.

CSR Activities
Opportunity
Investing in CSR activities 
and consistently executing 
them offers numerous 
advantages, including 
enhanced brand 
recognition, a positive 
Company reputation, 
accelerated growth, and a 
competitive edge over peers.
In FY24, the Company’s 
CSR initiatives were 
dedicated to supporting 
underprivileged 
communities through 
a variety of impactful 
activities. These 
included providing 
medical relief to cancer 
patients, organizing 
medical camps to 
offer essential health 
services, contributing 
to educational 
programs to enhance 
learning opportunities, 
distributing food items 
to children in need, and 
organizing sports events.
Positive: Funding 
and implementing 
CSR activities boost 
the Company’s brand 
value and drive positive 
social development 
in underprivileged 
communities through 
health, education, and 
other initiatives. This 
commitment can lead 
to increased customer 
loyalty, attract socially 
conscious investors, 
and improve employee 
morale, ultimately 
resulting in a stronger 
financial performance 
and long-term 
profitability.
3
ESG oversight Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Neglecting ESG 
parameters can result in 
shareholder dissatisfaction, 
potential litigation, 
reputational damage, and 
regulatory scrutiny.
Opportunity: Incorporating 
ESG strategies into business 
operations helps a Company 
gain investor confidence, 
earn customer loyalty, 
reduce operating costs, 
and enhance both asset 
management and financial 
performance.
The company has 
integrated various 
Environmental, Social, 
and Governance (ESG) 
principles into its daily 
operations, with a strong 
focus on key ESG areas 
such as CSR activities, 
energy, water, and waste 
management, as well 
as policy development 
and implementation. 
The Company’s BRSR 
report, demonstrate its 
ongoing commitment 
to ESG issues and 
outlining its goals for 
a sustainable future. 
Effluent treatment plant 
for cleaning of coloring 
ink infused wastewater in 
its plants. The Company 
has also done innovation 
on material transport by 
gravity sliders.
Positive: Leadership 
oversight on ESG 
performance and 
strategy boosts 
the Company’s 
environmental and 
community impact. 
It also strengthens 
monitoring mechanisms 
across ESG initiatives 
and business practices, 
which can lead to 
improved operational 
efficiencies, reduced 
risks, and enhanced 
financial performance.
Negative: Insufficient 
ESG oversight can lead 
to poor sustainability 
implementation, 
resulting in increased 
operational 
inefficiencies, higher 
compliance costs, 
and potential legal 
penalties. This may 
damage the Company’s 
reputation, erode 
investor confidence 
and negatively impact 
financial performance.

Sustainable 
Supply Chain
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: The key challenges 
in a sustainable supply 
chain include potential 
disruptions from unreliable 
suppliers, increased costs 
due to the need for ethical 
sourcing practices, and 
compliance challenges with 
environmental regulations.
Unfair Labour practices 
and working conditions in 
all tiers of the supply chain 
are challenging due to 
widespread informal Labour 
and varying standards of 
Labour rights enforcement. 
Slow adaptation of 
technology and innovation 
leads to high cost and 
resistance to change.
Opportunity: An 
effective and sustainable 
supply chain presents 
opportunities to build a 
robust economy, ensure 
flawless manufacturing 
processes, enhance 
quality management, 
reduce environmental 
impact, increase brand 
credibility, and foster 
improved collaboration with 
stakeholders.
Ongoing and 
continuous collaboration 
with our trusted 
vendors, regulators, 
manufacturers, financiers, 
and logistics teams have 
enabled us to establish 
an efficient supply chain. 
We have implemented a 
thorough due diligence 
process to carefully 
evaluate and onboard 
new vendors and 
suppliers. Collaboration 
with compliant 3PL 
partners for Labour 
services. New technology 
and ERP platforms are 
being implemented to 
keep up to the pace of 
technological change/
standard practices in 
domain.
Positive: A sustainable 
supply chain enhances 
financial performance 
by ensuring maximum 
business efficiency, 
reducing environmental 
impact, and adding 
long-term value to the 
Company’s sustainability 
initiatives. This leads 
to cost savings, 
improved operational 
performance, and 
a stronger market 
position.
Negative: Inefficient 
supply chains can result 
in increased costs due to 
unforeseen demand and 
limited logistics capacity. 
Mismanagement 
leads to ineffective 
resource utilization, 
higher expenses in 
material procurement, 
and greater waste 
throughout the product 
lifecycle.
5
Regulatory 
and Legal 
Compliances
Risk
One of the most significant 
risks is the imposition of 
penalties, fines, or legal 
actions by regulatory bodies 
for non-compliance. 
All risks related to 
compliance, regulations, 
contracts, non-
contractual obligations, 
disputes, reputation, 
and other factors are 
considered by the 
Company before making 
any decisions
Negative: Non-
compliance can damage 
a Company’s reputation 
and negatively impact 
its business activities, 
it may also result in 
monetary fines to more 
severe measures, such as 
operational restrictions 
or legal proceedings.

Health & 
Safety
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Workplace hazards 
pose significant risks to 
business operations, leading 
to reduced productivity, 
lower sales, decreased 
staff morale, and potential 
damage to the Company’s 
reputation. Effective health 
and safety measures 
are essential to mitigate 
these risks and maintain 
a stable and positive work 
environment.
Opportunity: Effective 
Health and Safety practices 
boost employee morale, 
increase productivity, 
and promote corporate 
responsibility. These 
practices not only enhance 
the well-being of employees 
but also strengthen the 
Company’s reputation and 
operational efficiency.
The company has 
conducted awareness 
sessions and training 
on quarterly basis like 
Mock fire drill, safety 
committee meetings, 
training of workers on 
how to use different type 
of fire extinguishers, 
marking assembly point 
in factories, display of 
fire exit plan at each 
floor of manufacturing 
unit etc. Independent 
third-party safety audits 
were conducted on 
yearly basis Programs 
on POSH, Health & 
Safety, Fire Safety, 5S, 
Quality Management, 
and Workers’ Rights & 
Responsibilities to foster a 
culture of safety. 
Positive: Incorporating 
health and safety 
in manufacturing 
leads to greater work 
participation, increased 
social inclusion, and 
higher performance. 
It also results in fewer 
workplace injuries and 
workers’ compensation 
claims, enhancing brand 
value and reputation in 
the market.
Negative: The most 
significant consequence 
of a poor safety 
culture is an increase 
in employee injuries 
and fatalities. Other 
detrimental effects 
include higher costs, 
increased employee 
absences, elevated 
healthcare expenses, 
workers’ compensation 
payments, low 
productivity, and low 
business disruptions.
7
Human 
Rights
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Forced Labour can 
lead to severe physical and 
mental abuse, resulting in 
significant health problems 
for employees. Ignoring 
human rights issues may 
result in losing valuable 
talent, forcing the Company 
to invest heavily in rehiring 
and training, which 
adversely impacts overall 
business performance.
Opportunity: Parameters 
on human rights such as 
fair working environment, 
equal opportunities, 
remuneration and freedom 
of association without ethnic 
discrimination will positively 
impact the performance of 
the Company on the social 
front from the employee’s 
perspective.
Campus is committed to 
upholding human rights 
and ethical practices. 
Summary of initiatives 
taken are as follows:
1.	 Human Rights 
Training and 
Awareness 
Programs: Regularly 
conducting training 
sessions to educate 
all employees and 
workers about human 
rights, ensuring all 
employees are aware 
of their rights and 
responsibilities.
2.	 Human Rights 
Clauses in Contracts: 
Including human 
rights clauses in 
all agreements & 
contracts to ensure all 
business operations 
align with ethical 
standards.
Negative: Loss of 
knowledge and highly 
experienced and skilled 
staff, high costs of 
recruitment and training 
and loss of productivity 
in workplaces are some 
of the ill effects of 
ignored human rights in 
a Company.
Positive: Ensuring 
equal opportunities 
and a harassment-free 
workplace significantly 
boosts employee morale 
and prevents industrial 
relations issues. This 
commitment not 
only fosters a positive 
work environment 
but also enhances 
overall productivity and 
operational efficiency.

8
Waste 
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Waste handling 
mechanisms involve 
risks such as regulatory 
non-compliance, which 
can result in fines and 
legal consequences, and 
environmental harm 
from improper disposal, 
potentially harming the 
Company’s reputation. 
Furthermore, inefficient 
waste handling can drive 
up operational costs 
and disrupt production 
processes.
Opportunity: Effective 
waste management 
practices can enhance 
operational efficiency, 
reduce costs, and improve 
environmental sustainability. 
They also strengthen the 
Company’s reputation and 
potentially generate cost 
savings through resource 
recovery and reduced 
disposal fees.

registered as an Importer 
under Plastic waste 
Management Rules, 
2016 and  plastic waste 
is disposed through 
registered recyclers. 
In addition, company 
ensures all waste is 
segregated at the 
source, with hazardous 
waste sent to authorized 
vendors to comply with 
the Hazardous & Other 
Wastes (Management 
and Transboundary 
Movement) Rules, 2016.

Additionally, hazardous 
and electronic waste is 
disposed of in accordance 
with the Environment 
Protection Act and other 
relevant regulations like 
E-waste Management 
Rules, Battery Waste 
Management Rules etc.
Positive: Enhances 
regulatory compliance, 
and boost the 
Company’s reputation, 
potentially attracting 
environmentally 
conscious customers 
and investors. Significant 
financial benefits such 
as reduced disposal 
and operational costs 
through optimized 
recycling. 
Negative: Increased 
disposal costs, 
fines for regulatory 
non-compliance, 
higher operational 
expenses due to 
inefficient processes, 
environmental damage, 
and reputational harm, 
potentially causing loss 
of customer trust and 
decreased sales.

Energy 
Management 
& GHG 
Emissions
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Inefficient energy 
management can drive 
up energy costs and 
GHG-related expenses. 
The primary challenge 
associated with energy 
conservation initiatives is 
the initial expense involved 
in upgrading obsolete 
systems, equipment, or 
facilities to more energy-
efficient models. Poor 
energy practices and high 
emissions can harm the 
Company’s reputation as 
well as reduce customer 
trust and investor 
confidence.
Opportunity: 
Implementing efficient 
energy management can 
lower consumption and 
operational costs, leading 
to long-term savings. 
Adopting energy-efficient 
technologies not only 
qualifies the Company for 
various benefits but also 
drives innovation, enhances 
operational efficiency, and 
offers a competitive market 
edge.
Campus has 
implemented energy-
efficient initiatives such 
as usage of Inverter 
air conditioners & LED 
lights to optimize 
power consumption. 
The company has a 
Solar Plant installed at 
their Ganaur plant. The 
company is actively 
working to implement 
energy-efficient initiatives 
aimed at reducing GHG 
emissions. By adopting 
advanced technologies 
and optimizing energy 
use, the company is 
committed to minimizing 
its environmental 
impact and enhancing 
overall sustainability. 
The company has also 
installed wet scrubber 
unit for VOC treatment 
on EVA machines at 
Ganaur Plant.
Positive: Efficient 
energy management 
lowers operational 
costs and leads to 
long-term savings. 
Adopting energy-
efficient technologies 
can also qualify the 
Company for regulatory 
incentives and enhance 
its reputation, attracting 
environmentally 
conscious customers 
and investors. 
Negative: Implementing 
energy-efficient 
technologies can involve 
high initial costs and 
regulatory compliance 
expenses, which 
may strain financial 
resources. Additionally, 
transitioning to new 
systems can cause 
temporary operational 
disruptions.
