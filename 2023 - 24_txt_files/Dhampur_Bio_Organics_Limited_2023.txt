2.	 Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, and 
social topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the input received from stakeholders on these 
topics were incorporated into policies and activities of the entity. 
DBO prioritizes stakeholder engagement to identify and manage environmental and social topics through a robust materiality 
assessment process. We gather insights on environmental and social issues from employees, investors, NGOs, and communities via 
surveys, focus groups, and forums. This stakeholder input, combined with internal analysis, informs our materiality matrix which identifies 
the most significant sustainability challenges. These prioritized issues directly influence our policies and activities, as exemplified by our 
ESG goals and targets. This ongoing engagement ensures our environmental and social efforts address the most pressing issues for a 
sustainable future.
3.	 Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/ 
marginalized stakeholder groups.
Recognizing farmers as the cornerstone of our business, DBO prioritizes open communication and collaboration to address their concerns 
and foster sustainable livelihoods. Through a dedicated team of field staff, we maintain regular farmers’ meetings, known as “Goshtis,” 
which provide crucial platforms for open dialogue and feedback. These meetings ensure farmers’ voices are heard and issues effectively 
addressed. Going beyond problem-solving, we empower farmers through targeted initiatives. Our dedicated field staff facilitates access 
to essential agricultural inputs, while training programs equip farmers with the knowledge and skills to adopt sustainable practices and 
adapt to changing environmental conditions.

Yes	  √
No	  
Zero Liquid Discharge technology has been implemented in the Company’s distillery division. All the effluent generated from distillery 
are processed in Condensate Polishing Unit (CPU), which includes primary treatment, Anaerobic Digestion in ICx Reactor followed 
by aerobic process. We use 100% concentrated spent wash as fuel in our Incineration Slop Boiler, efficiently utilizing waste from the 
distillation process. The treated effluent is further polished through RO and subsequently reused in Process. This approach minimizes our 
environmental impact, aligning with circular economy principles and responsible water management.
Thus, helping us is achieving ZLD & reply less on freshwater requirement. Apart from above, Treated Effluent in Sugar Division comply 
with stipulated norms and are used for irrigation purpose.

Apart from these three waste categories, negligible amount of hazardous waste is also generated from Process viz. used oil, empty 
containers & cotton rags. Used oil, containers & cotton rags are sent to TSDF for disposal, while E-Waste & plastic waste generated is sent 
to authorized recyclers for disposal.
Hazardous Waste generated is stored at a designated place near Cane Yard & ETP and is disposed through TSDF within 180 days of 
disposal. Form-3 is maintained for generation of hazardous wastes at Unit level.
