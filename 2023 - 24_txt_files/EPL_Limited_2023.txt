Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report
Business Responsibility & Sustainability Reporting (“BRSR”) is the practice of companies disclosing information about their 
environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance. It goes beyond financial reporting to provide stakeholders with a 
comprehensive view of a company’s non-financial impacts and contributions to sustainable development. BRSR covers topics such as

        Details of the same in brief:
For identifying and tracking conflict of interests involving the Directors / KMPs of the Company, the Secretarial Team maintains a 
database of the Directors and the entities in which they have substantial interest. This list is shared with the Finance Team, which flags 
off the parties in their system for monitoring and tracking transaction(s) entered by the Company with such parties. 
Further, the Company regularly requests and receives from each member of the Board, a list of entities in which they have a substantial 
interest, at the beginning of every financial year and as and when there is any change in such interest. 
In addition, a declaration is also taken annually from the Directors under the Code of Conduct confirming that they will always act in 
the interest of the Company and ensure that any other business or personal association which they may have, does not involve any 
conflict of interest with the operations of the Company and the role therein. The Senior Management also affirms annually that they 
have not entered into any material, financial and commercial transactions, which may have a potential conflict with the interest of the 
Company at large. In the Meetings of the Board, the Directors abstain from participating in the items in which they have a potential 
conflict of interest. There is also a guidance mechanism in place for directors/senior management to address potential conflict of 
interests that may arise in recommending/approving proposals for investments/ granting loans.

Note:
EPL is committed to making its supply chain sustainable. To achieve this goal, we have integrated Social Responsibility principles on 
environment & social responsibility & ethics in our procurement process. As part of our sustainability approach, we have developed a 
"Supplier Sustainability Code of Conduct" to ensure that all our suppliers comply with legal requirements, ethical practices, human rights, 
and environmental management. 
The code of conduct is based on globally recognized and accepted international standards, including those set forth by the International Labour 
Organization, UN Global Compact principles, United Nations' Business and Human Rights principles, and industry best practices. Adherence to 
the code of conduct is an expectation for doing business with EPL. It defines the minimum standards that EPL expects its suppliers, including their 
sub-tier suppliers or sub-contractors, to respect and adhere to. By adopting this approach, we aim to work collaboratively with our suppliers 
towards a sustainable future. Our supplier code of conduct is also available at our website at : https://www.eplglobal.com/wp-content/
themes/epl-website/pdf/EPL-Supplier-Sustainability-Code-of-Conduct.pdf 
In FY 24 sustainably sourced inputs were approx. 60% of our total procurement.

EPL materiality assessment approach:
Reporting: Report the progress on the key material issues identified through the materiality exercise.
Categorization: The list of potential material issues was refined by clustering them into categories of Governance, Environmental and 
Social.
Identification: Secondary research and a review of relevant global and sectoral report on broader sustainability trends, risks, and 
possibilities resulted in the list of probable material issues.
Prioritization: Material issues were prioritized based through extensive consultations with our Corporate Leadership Team and the 
Sustainability Steering Committee.
Integration: Prioritized material issues were further validated with key stakeholders to arrive at issues which are most material to us. 
These issues are integrated in our business processes, operations and monitoring and mechanisms.

5.     Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge?
No
         If yes, provide details of its coverage and implementation.
In our operations the only liquid discharge is process water, which is primarily used in our operations for machine and mould cooling 
purposes. We value this key resource, hence we have initiatives in place to reduce our water consumption & have implemented a 
closed-loop system that recirculates water for cooling through our chillers and reuse the water. This has minimized our water usage 
and ensures efficient management of this key resource Further in adherence to our Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), we have 
installed Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) in our manufacturing plants to recycle wastewater. This enables us to treat wastewater 
and is then recycled back into our operations, thereby minimising discharge of water as well as enabling less fresh water draw, 
thereby reducing the impact on the environment. Our commitment to sustainable water management is an ongoing effort, and we 
continually assess our operations to identify areas where we can improve our water efficiency and reduce our water footprint, across 
all our plants

Optimizing Energy Efficiency in 
Chiller Systems  at Vasind Plant
By replacing five pumps with a single pump running at 30 kW, 
energy consumption has been significantly reduced from 46.5 kW 
to just 30 kW, resulting in substantial energy savings. This efficient 
pump replacement demonstrates the importance of optimizing 
equipment usage to conserve energy.

for Slitting trim waste in terms 
of Energy Conservation, Space 
Optimization, and Enhanced 
Handling at Vasind Plant
Previously, a 7.5 kW trim exhaust blower was used to expel trim 
outside, causing space constraints and contamination from dust 
and water in open areas. However, with the introduction of trim 
rewinders, power consumption has reduced to 1.5 kW. The trim is 
now stored in coil form on pallets, occupying less space, and can be 
easily moved using a hydraulic pallet truck (HPT). Moreover, the trim 
is much cleaner and can be recycled if desired.
