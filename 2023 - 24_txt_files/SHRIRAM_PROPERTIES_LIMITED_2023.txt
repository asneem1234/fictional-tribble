Throughout the financial year, we prioritized the dissemination of critical principles such as quality, environment and 
safety across our value chain. Emphasizing the paramount importance of quality, environment and safety in all our 
operations, we meticulously educated our vendors on adhering to stringent quality standards and robust environment 
& safety protocols.

the prohibition of child and forced labor. By instilling a culture where quality, environment, safety, and ethical business

2.	
Does the entity have processes in place to avoid/ manage conflict of interests involving members of the Board? (Yes/
No) If yes, provide details of the same.
	
As required under the Companies Act 2013, the Company obtains Annual Declarations from the Directors and KMPs, and 
also periodical declaration for the changes if any to the declaration made earlier. The declarations help the Company to 
identify the conflict and avoid such transactions as appropriate. Further, the Director interested in any subject matter, 
will recuse himself from the meeting and move out of the meeting room. In the discussion on the evaluation of Directors 
by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, the Director concerned will not participate, while he is being evaluated 
by other members.
	
The Code of Conduct for Directors, KMPs and Senior Employees also has an appropriate process to disclose the 
conflict situation.
PRINCIPLE 2
Businesses should provide goods and services in a manner that is sustainable and safe
Essential Indicators
1.	
Percentage of R&D and capital expenditure (capex) investments in specific technologies to improve the environmental 
and social impacts of product and processes to total R&D and capex investments made by the entity, respectively.
	
In our efforts to enhance the environmental and social impacts of our construction processes, we have invested in 
aluminum formwork technology. Aluminum formwork is a sustainable alternative to traditional wooden formwork, 
significantly reducing timber usage and minimizing deforestation. It also helps in reducing construction waste due to its 
reusability. Socially, the lightweight nature of aluminum formwork reduces the physical strain on workers and lowers the 
risk of on-site injuries, promoting a safer working environment. Additionally, the precision and efficiency of aluminum 
formwork result in high-quality, durable structures, contributing to safer and more resilient buildings for end users
2.	
Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No). If yes, what percentage of inputs were 
sourced sustainably?
	
YES, the Company integrates sustainability into its supply chain and is driven by the Sustainable Supply Chain Management 
Policy (SSCM)
	
The Company gives priority to purchasing locally available materials/products of high quality to minimize environmental 
impact and gives preference to green-certified field products (including FSC and other products)
	
Approximately 30% of the inputs were sourced sustainably.
3.	
Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of life, 
for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.
	
The Company is in the business of construction and development of residential homes. We have detailed process for 
recycling and reusing of materials as below:
	
Plastics: The waste generated during construction, which are removed for recycling or disposal by the vendors
	
a.	
E-waste: E-waste is handled centrally through our authorized e-waste handlers
	
b.	
Hazardous waste: Not applicable
	
c.	
Other waste: STP is provided at sites to treat the wastewater and is reused for Gardening. Organic waste convertors 
are deployed at most of the sites.
	
The Company uses a state of art material for the fabrication of concrete using Aluminum sheet. This material is 85% 
reusable after the completion of the project to another Project. This reduces the use of natural materials like wooden 
planks/ shuttering materials.
4.	
Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes / No). If yes, whether the 
waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to Pollution Control

Details of the initiative
Outcome of the initiative
1
Promoting sustainable 
construction*
Significant change we have made is the modification of our concrete mix 
composition. Instead of relying solely on high cement content, we have 
introduced GGBS as a Supplementary Cementitious Material (SCM). GGBS 
is a byproduct of manufacturing iron in a blast furnace. By incorporating 
GGBS, we not only reduce the amount of cement needed but also 
decrease the carbon footprint associated with cement production. 
Reduction in the water usage by replacing conventional water curing with 
curing compound.
And in case of water curing, sprinkler technique has been adopted instead 
of conventional type.
Rod straightening machine implemented to use the lower dia rods which 
may end up as scrap.

Usage of LED bulbs
Replacing the normal candescent bulbs with LED bulbs
3
Wastewater 
Management
Wastewater generated is treated at the sewage treatment plant 
(STP) and reused efficiently for secondary consumption purposes like 
gardening, landscaping and flushing. This process significantly reduces 
our dependence on potable water, thereby conserving precious water 
resources.
4
Water Conservation 
Initiatives*
To reduce water waste, implemented several water conservation 
measures, ensuring the use of low-flow fixtures and efficient irrigation 
methods. These measures include:
•	
Water-efficient showerheads
•	
Water-efficient bathroom faucets
•	
Efficient water closets
•	
Water-efficient kitchen faucets
27% Water Savings

Energy Conservation 
Initiatives*
Following energy conservation measures have been considered on design 
phase at Park 63 project,
•	
Reduced Wall to Wall ratio
•	
Reflective exterior wall
•	
Natural Ventilation
•	
Efficient Exterior Lighting
38% of energy savings
6
Renewable Energy*
Power usage in common areas at Park 63 is converted to green power 
sources to reduce our carbon footprint. This initiative includes the 
installation of solar photovoltaic (PV) modules thus ensures sustainable 
energy practices are adopted throughout the project.

Implementation of 
Voided Slabs*
We have utilised in applicable areas Voided slab technology has been 
adopted where it is a sustainable construction method aimed at reducing 
the environmental impact of concrete structures. By incorporating 
filler material within concrete slabs, voided slabs significantly reduce 
the amount of concrete & steel needed for construction. This results 
in a substantial decrease in carbon emissions associated with cement 
production, contributing to a greener and more sustainable built 
environment. 
8
Implementation of 
Waffle Slabs*
We have utilised in applicable areas Waffle slab technology has been 
adopted where it is an innovative construction approach designed to 
minimize the environmental impact of concrete structures. By utilizing 
a grid pattern of ribs on the underside of slabs, waffle slabs reduce the 
amount of concrete required for construction while maintaining structural 
integrity. This reduction in concrete & steel usage results in decreased 
carbon emissions associated with cement production, making waffle 
slabs an environmentally friendly choice for building projects. Additionally, 
waffle slabs offer enhanced structural efficiency, allowing for larger spans 
and reduced need for columns, further reducing material usage and 
environmental footprint. 
The adoption of waffle slab 
technology has contributed 
to significant reductions in 
concrete consumption and 
associated carbon emissions.

Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan?
	
The Company has plans in place to meet the emergent situations. In a situation like the recent pandemic, the continuity 
of operations is tested and successfully working with employees in remote locations. The continuous training on Safety 
and Fire drill at the site and offices provide adequate backup for continued business operations. There are multiple 
vendors for the supply of materials and labour, to substitute in case of need. The IT SAP systems and Data are stored
