Does the entity have any project related to reducing Greenhouse Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details:
	
DIL is actively enhancing its energy efficiency through a variety of initiatives. One notable effort includes the adoption of 
electric vehicles for delivering our products to consumers. This forward-thinking approach aligns with our commitment 
to sustainability and reducing our carbon footprint.
	
We have implemented energy-saving measures across our restaurants, including upgrading to LED lighting, optimizing 
HVAC systems, and utilizing energy-efficient kitchen equipment. These efforts help us reduce our overall energy 
consumption and subsequently lower greenhouse gas emissions.
	
In addition to internal emission reduction efforts, we are exploring opportunities to offset our carbon footprint through 
investments in carbon offset projects such as installation of solar roof plants. These projects help to replace fossil fuel-
based energy with renewable alternatives.
	
In response to growing concerns regarding sustainable energy practices, we are pleased to disclose our proactive 
measures towards embracing renewable energy sources. Over the past year, we have strategically installed solar 
roof plants at five of our locations, boasting a cumulative capacity of 63 kW. Furthermore, leveraging our existing 
infrastructure, we maintain a robust capacity of 424 kW, reaffirming our commitment to reducing our carbon footprint 
and fostering a greener future
	
The Company believes in leveraging technology to transform every dimension of its business. Investments in technology 
infrastructure are an important element of the Company’s commitment to delivering seamless customer experience. 
Further, steps taken towards Energy Conservation are the result of technology absorption.
	
The Company has been leveraging technological advancements in relevant areas. For data driven analytics and decision 
making, the Company has invested in a scalable and advanced cloud data warehouse along with Business Intelligence 
platform. Digital Project Management is being implemented for Business Development. In the area of Customer Service 
and Restaurant Operations, use of Self-Ordering kiosks (SOKs), Digital menu boards and kitchen planning are being 
aggressively adopted. The Company is also experimenting with the use of AI in improving forecast accuracy and quality.
	
For the refurbishment of one of KFC’s Flagship Stores – This store was converted as one of the sustainable store by 
utilizing eco friendly & vernacular material. Materials such as locally sourced wood, recycled tiles, Low VOC paints, 
Natural clay tiles etc. are utilized in the construction to reduce the Carbon footprint of the store.
	
At DIL, our dedication to reducing greenhouse gas emissions drives us to implement a range of sustainable initiatives. 
This includes transitioning our stores to solar energy, utilizing electric bikes for deliveries, and integrating sustainable 
materials into our store design.

Renewable Energy
We have implemented energy-saving measures across our 
restaurants, including upgrading to LED lighting, optimizing 
HVAC systems, and utilizing energy-efficient kitchen equipment. 
These efforts help us reduce our overall energy consumption and 
subsequently lower greenhouse gas emissions.

Operations
In addition to internal emission reduction efforts, we are exploring 
opportunities to offset our carbon footprint through investments 
in carbon offset projects such as installation of solar roof plants. 
These projects help to replace fossil fuel-based energy with 
renewable alternatives.
In response to growing concerns regarding sustainable energy 
practices, we are pleased to disclose our proactive measures 
towards embracing renewable energy sources. Over the past 
year, we have strategically installed solar roof plants at five of our 
locations, boasting a cumulative capacity of 63 kW. Furthermore, 
leveraging our existing infrastructure, we maintain a robust 
capacity of 424 kW, reaffirming our commitment to reducing our 
carbon footprint and fostering a greener future

Sustainable Sourcing
We prioritize sourcing ingredients and products from suppliers

agriculture and food production. Devyani International Limited 
(DIL) has robust procedures in place for sustainable sourcing to 
ensure the promotion of environmental, social, and governance 
(ESG) practices throughout our supply chain. We have developed 
comprehensive business agreements with sustainability factors 
embedded, outlining our expectations from suppliers. These

laws, regulations, and industry standards.
Sustainable 
Sourcing
At DIL, we prioritize partnering with suppliers and vendors who 
share our commitment to sustainability. We seek out those who 
demonstrate a dedication to implementing policies, practices, and 
protocols aligned with our sustainability strategies and guidelines. 
This includes initiatives aimed at reducing environmental impact, 
promoting social responsibility, and upholding ethical business 
practices.
To ensure adherence to these expectations, we conduct regular 
supplier audits. These audits serve as a mechanism to verify 
compliance and ensure that our vendors are meeting the 
sustainability criteria outlined in our agreements. By implementing 
these procedures, DIL aims to foster a sustainable supply chain 
that aligns with our values and contributes to a more responsible 
and resilient business ecosystem.
