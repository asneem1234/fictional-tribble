Positive
3
Waste 
management
 R
Waste management is a material issue 
due to growing regulatory pressure, 
as companies that fail to comply with 
regulations may face legal and financial 
consequences.
Improper disposal of waste can have 
detrimental effects on our ecosystems 
and public health. Waste management is

footprint, reduceexpenses, explore fresh 
avenues for business growth and ensure 
compliance with regulations.
Positive
4
Climate 
change-
related risks
R
Climate change is a significant risk for 
companies due to the growing awareness 
of the negative impact of human activities 
on the environment. To mitigate this risk, 
companies must adopt more sustainable 
practices and offer environment-friendly 
products to meet the changing 
demands of their customers and 
stakeholders.
The Company recognises the importance 
of being proactive in responding to the 
challenges and opportunities presented 
by climate change. By charting out 
strategy, the Company is well-positioned 
to respond to climate change-related 
risks.
Negative
O
The increasing awareness of the negative 
impact of human activities on the 
environment, particularly climate change, 
presents a significant opportunity for 
companies. Responding to this concern, 
the Company is putting concentrated 
efforts to develop sustainable products and 
environment-friendly solutions.
Positive
5
Water 
management
R
The increasing scarcity of freshwater 
sources can disrupt the Company’s 
operations, supply chain, and reputation, 
leading to potential economic losses. 
Additionally, companies that rely heavily on 
water for their operations, such as chemical 
manufacturing, are particularly vulnerable to 
water-related risks
The Company has developed in-house 
expertise and solutions for optimising 
water usage in industrial plants.
Negative
O
The Company’s effective water 
management practices are helping to 
mitigate risks associated with water scarcity, 
such as disruptions to its operations, supply 
chain, and reputation. Furthermore, the 
Company considers water management as 
an opportunity to reduce customer’s water 
consumption, save costs, and increase 
efficiency. Adopting sustainable water 
practices can mitigate risks associated with 
water scarcity, preserve vital ecosystems, 
and ensure access to safe and clean 
drinking water for communities.
Positive

Emission 
management
O
The Company’s utmost priority is emission 
management through various activities that

while also reaping the benefits of a more 
sustainable and profitable business model.

7
Local 
employment
R
Lack of employment opportunities in 
the local area can impede economic 
development in the community, resulting in 
insufficient support from local stakeholders. 
Furthermore, businesses that fail to 
prioritise local employment may encounter 
challenges in accessing the skills and 
expertise of the local workforce, resulting in 
escalated costs and decreased efficiency.
The Company’s emphasis on local hiring 
minimises the risks and establishes 
favourable relationships with the local 
community as a responsible corporate.
Negative
8
Occupational 
health & 
safety
R
Workplace accidents and illnesses can 
impact productivity and increase costs. 
It may damage the reputation of the 
Company and may adversely impact the 
morale of employees and its culture.
The Company has implemented 
the OHSE policy and enforces strict 
adherence to it. Several initiatives and 
programmes have also been initiated 
to manage health and safety, which are 
continually monitored for improvement. 
One of the initiatives is the Behaviour 
Based Safety programme, which aims 
to bring about a cultural shift towards 
safety improvement. Furthermore, 
the Company has put in place several 
insurances and 
medical policies to safeguard its 
employees
Negative
9
Talent 
acquisition 
and retention
R
The inability to attract and retain top 
talent can result in a shortage of 
skilled employees, leading to reduced 
productivity, increased costs, and potential 
quality issues. Additionally, the turnover 
of key employees can lead to a loss of 
institutional knowledge and expertise, 
which can negatively impact the Company’s 
competitiveness and ability to innovate.
The Company has implemented various 
measures to attract and retain talent 
through initiatives such as job rotation, 
up-skilling, reskilling, training, fast-track 
promotion, leadership development 
programmes, etc. 
Moreover, the Company has taken steps 
to ensure the well-being of its employees.
Negative
10
Responsible 
supply chain 
management
R
Consumers are becoming increasingly 
aware of the ethical and environmental 
impacts of the products they purchase, and 
they are more likely to avoid brands that do 
not meet their expectations. This can lead 
to a loss of market share and reputational 
damage for companies. By prioritising 
responsible supply chain management 
practices, companies 
can mitigate these risks, improve their 
reputation, and gain a competitive 
advantage in the market. Failure to ensure 
that suppliers meet environmental and 
social standards can lead to legal and 
regulatory challenges, resulting in fines, 
legal action, and negative publicity.
The Company enforces a vendor code 
of conduct and actively collaborates with 
vendors to improve its operations. The 
vendor code of conduct lays down 
guidelines outlining expectations and 
standards for vendors who provide 
goods or services to the Company. It 
covers various areas such as labour 
practices, human rights, environmental 
sustainability, and business ethics. By 
having a vendor code of conduct, the 
Company sets clear expectations for 
its suppliers, ensuring they meet the 
necessary standards.
Negative
11
Labour 
management 
relations
R
Not adhering to labour laws not only violates 
human rights but can also lead to legal 
and reputational risks for the Company. 
Negative publicity resulting from labour 
disputes, strikes, or other labour-related 
issues can lead to a loss of customer 
confidence and reduced sales.
The Company ensures ongoing 
monitoring and audits which reveal 
compliance at all locations. 
This helps the Company to progressively 
move to the next level as envisioned 
through the Social Compact initiative.

Diversity 
& equal 
opportunity
O
A diverse workforce can bring new 
perspectives and ideas, which can lead 
to increased creativity and innovation. 
Different viewpoints and experiences can 
improve decision-making and lead to more 
thoughtful decisions. A diverse workforce 
can also help companies better understand 
and serve a diverse customer base, which 
can lead to improved customer satisfaction 
and financial performance.
Positive
13
Ethics & 
integrity
O
Prioritising ethics and integrity can lead to 
enhanced reputation, increased customer 
loyalty, improved employee morale, and 
better risk management. 
Companies that operate with ethics and 
integrity create a culture of trust and 
transparency, which can attract customers, 
investors, and top talent. 
Employees are more likely to feel engaged 
and committed to a company that operates 
with integrity, leading to increased 
productivity and retention.

Statement by the director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG-related 
challenges, targets and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this 
disclosure)
Thermax has been committed to environmental well-being since its inception, prioritising ESG long before it 
became a mainstream concept. The Company aims to reduce 25% of absolute carbon emissions from the base 
year 2019 by 2025 as part of its decarbonisation journey. To achieve this, multiple initiatives with respect to 
improving operational efficiency, addition to renewable energy generation and its procurement, and fuel switch, 
are being implemented across its facilities. On the business side, the Company offers a range of energy-efficient 
and environment-friendly products and solutions. This enables industries to optimise their energy consumption, 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions and minimise their freshwater intake through the reuse and recycling of water. 
Cognisant of the change in the energy mix in recent times, and its ability to contribute to this transition, Thermax 
has concentrated its efforts towards green energy. It has proactively aligned its strategies with climate change 
mitigation and sustainability goals. Along with investing in R&D and digital capabilities, it has inked partnerships 
with global technology majors to strengthen its clean energy offerings and to solidify its presence as a trusted 
partner in energy transition and water management to its customers.
On the social front, Thermax is actively engaged in initiatives, striving to create equal opportunities through 
education and empowering the informal workforce through its SoCo initiative.
Although the Company is making persistent efforts to meet its ESG imperatives, there are many challenges on 
its journey. These include dealing with the complexity of the infrastructure of existing industries and transitioning 
them into cleaner and more sustainable alternatives, cost implications for implementing the technological 
innovations, assessing and managing the sustainability practices of its suppliers and mitigating any environmental 
or associated social risks, and data collection and reporting on ESG performance metrics across the organisation. 
Despite these challenges, Thermax remains dedicated to addressing them through ongoing innovation, strategic 
partnerships, stakeholder engagement, and continuous improvement of its ESG practices. Over the past year, 
concrete progress has been achieved through targeted projects, including the successful procurement of 
renewable electricity for major manufacturing plants, the installation of solar rooftop systems at critical locations 
like Solapur and Bhosari plants, and the strategic switch from natural gas to biomass fuel in the boiler at the Dahej 
plant. We know we have come a long way, but there is still much to be done.

The Company has a Code of Conduct. This Code of Conduct, aimed towards the Board of Directors and 
senior management, is made publicly accessible on the Company’s website (https://www.thermaxglobal.
com/corporate-governancepolicies-and-disclosures/)
	
	
Under the guidelines outlined in the Code, directors, key managerial personnel, and senior management are 
expected to avoid scenarios in which their personal interests may directly conflict with the Company’s welfare. 
This involves an annual mandatory disclosure of any potential conflicts of interest to the Board of Directors by 
the aforesaid categories of personnel.
	
	
Another significant measure involves the proper management of related party transactions. Necessary 
approvals are obtained from both the Audit Committee and the Board prior to entering such transactions, 
particularly if the directors involved have vested interests in the process. The Company’s policy strictly 
reiterates that any directors or key managerial personnel should abstain from participation in instances where 
they may have a personal conflict of interest, thereby minimising the opportunity for improper influence or 
unwanted complications within the workplace.

(a) 	 Is there a mechanism available to receive and redress grievances for the following categories of 
employees and workers? If yes, give details of the mechanism in brief.
Permanent workers
 Yes, the mechanism to receive and redress grievances is in place. The Whistleblower Policy facilitates 
the reporting of protected disclosures to top-level management, including the chairperson, managing 
director, or the chair of the Audit Committee. This process is managed through distinct communication 
avenues, channelling grievances from different sources and addressing them to senior officials. Two 
specific email addresses have been assigned for this purpose to ensure written complaints can be 
directly submitted. The confidentiality of the whistleblower is strived for, and any retaliatory actions are 
not permitted.
The organisation has put into place a Prevention of Sexual Harassment Policy, consistent with the 
directives of the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act 
2013. This policy is applicable to all individuals irrespective of their employment status and is supported 
by regular virtual training sessions to create awareness within the organisation.
Moreover, a Code of Conduct equally applies to both employees and business partners. Ensuring 
adherence to this code, diverse training initiatives have been undertaken, encompassing all employees 
from varied business sectors and geographies. The Whistleblower Policy, however, does not include 
daily workers’ grievances. For addressing these concerns, the Company organises town hall meetings, 
which provide a platform for employees to freely voice their troubles. Furthermore, several other 
platforms, including induction sessions and more town hall meetings, are available for employees to 
articulate their grievances.

10.	 Health and safety management system:
	
(a)	 Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the 
entity? (Yes/No). If yes, the coverage of such a system?
	
	
Yes, the Company has taken a systematic approach to safeguard the health and safety of its employees 
by implementing the ISO 45001:2018 Occupational Health and Safety Management System across its 
manufacturing, EPC (Engineering, Procurement, and Construction) and O&M (Operations & Maintenance) 
sites. This application aims at promoting a positive occupational health and safety (OHS) culture within 
the organisation.
	
	
By establishing standard operating procedures for every task, the organisation ensures that activities are 
carried out consistently and safely. In addition, contingency management protocols have been instituted, 
including conducting frequent mock drills, to increase preparedness and response to potential emergencies.
	
	
The organisation conducts regular training sessions about occupational health and safety procedures and 
preferred practices.
	
(b)	 What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-
routine basis by the entity?
	
	
The Company has adopted multiple methods for identifying potential and work-related risks to ensure a 
healthy and safe workplace. These methods include risk assessment, job safety analysis, health, safety, and 
environment (HSE) audits, site severity index rating, and daily site inspections, which are conducted regularly. 
Furthermore, an IT-enabled platform called ‘Thermax OHSE’ has been implemented. This platform is utilised 
by Thermax employees and workers for reporting any identified hazards. The platform also facilitates the 
monitoring and tracking of reported hazard resolution. Overall, these measures contribute to creating a safe 
and healthy environment for all personnel.
	
(c)	 Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove 
themselves from such risks? (Yes/No)
	
	
The organisation has instated safety protocols and health measures to ensure a safe and productive work 
environment. Recognising employees’ active participation in safety, the Company has facilitated the provision 
for workers to report occupational hazards and provided stop work authority to every workman in case of 
imminent risk.
	
	
To enhance safety norms, the Company utilises a health, safety and environment (HSE) application for 
observing and reporting HSE conditions. This digital tool has improved the safety measures at our operational 
sites by substantially mitigating the associated risks.
	
	
Furthermore, the organisation has adopted new initiatives aimed at promoting a safety culture. One 
such measure is the introduction of a behaviour-based safety programme. Through this programme, the 
organisation encourages safe behaviour among employee activities, rectifies any inappropriate behaviour, 
and flags it for future reference. In addition to this, the organisation is progressively digitising HSE 
160  |  #ThermaxForABetterTomorrow  
management. This move aims at fostering a sense of accountability among employees and improving the 
transparency of our operations. To motivate and reward compliance with safety standards, the organisation 
has instituted a recognition system for individuals who demonstrate exemplary commitment to safety 
protocols. Simultaneously, a consequence management system has been structured to address any 
violations of the established safety protocols.
	
(d)	 Do the employees/workers of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare 
services? (Yes/No)
	
	
Yes. Medical centres and first aid facilities are available for both employees and workers. The entity has 
implemented several measures diligently to ensure a secure and healthy environment for the workforce. The 
on-site medical facilities are easily accessible to all staff members. Additionally, first aid facilities are available 
across the organisation, prepared for immediate assistance in case of any emergencies or unforeseen 
medical conditions. This comprehensive healthcare infrastructure upholds the health and well-being of not 
just permanent employees but also temporary and contractual labour.

* The BRSR Core requires disclosure of ‘‘Number of Permanent Disabilities’’, however, it does not include the definition of ‘Permanent 
Disabilities’. We, in the absence of any other guidance, have considered high consequence work-related injury or ill health, which results 
in an injury from which the employee/worker cannot or is not expected to recover fully to the previous health status, this does not include 
fatalities. There are no incidents resulting in permanent disabilities.
12.	 Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy work place.
	
The Company has incorporated protective measures to create a safe and healthy working environment. Ensuring 
well-being, safety, and security for all regular and contractual employees has been deemed to be a fundamental 
priority by the organisation.
	
The Organisation’s Occupational Health, Safety, and Environmental (OHSE) Policy, authorised by the Managing 
Director and CEO, serves as a compulsory guideline for every individual employed by or representing Thermax 
Limited. The Company engages in the identification of hazards and the evaluation of risks and opportunities 
(HIARO) associated with every operation, implementing appropriate mitigating strategies in response. Standard 
operating procedures (SOPs) have been made uniformly accessible for all functional activities.
	
The Company is committed to providing regular Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) training to all employees 
through developing e-learning modules covering diverse safety subjects. In compliance with statutory 
requirements, safety committees have been established and safety council meetings are organised regularly at 
respective work locations and business units.
	
Pre-employment medical fitness evaluations are a condition of hiring, ensuring that all employees and workers 
meet the health standards. Compliance with the health, safety and environment guidelines is affirmed by 
department heads and undergoes regular scrutiny. To monitor attentively, periodic safety audits and inspections 
focussed on high-risk sectors such as work at height, material handling, confined spaces, and electrical and fire

Does the entity have any project related to reducing greenhouse gas emissions? If yes, then provide 
details.
	
The Company has been proactively implementing operational efficiency initiatives and renewable energy projects 
to minimise its carbon footprint and promote a sustainable future. Throughout the year, the Company has 
undertaken several measures aimed at conserving energy and resources, including:
	
a.	
Electricity: Thermax has effectively executed multiple operational efficiency projects at its manufacturing 
plants. These include addressing compressor leakages, installing variable frequency drives (VFD) on 
various equipment, deploying motion sensors to prevent unnecessary usage, optimising operations of 
effluent treatment plant (ETP) blowers, substituting cooling water pumps with energy-efficient alternatives 
at process cooling towers, and implementing LED lighting in workshops. These initiatives have not only 
resulted in reduced energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions for Thermax but have also enhanced 
operational efficiency and lowered costs.
	
b.	
Fuel: Thermax is actively enhancing operational efficiency and minimising its carbon footprint through 
strategic projects. For instance, at the Paudh plant, measures have been implemented to optimise boiler 
operations. These efforts have led to a significant reduction of 133.91 metric tonnes in furnace oil (LHS oil) 
consumption, while at the Dahej plant, Thermax has transitioned to biomass from natural gas, resulting  into 
saving of natural gas. These projects have resulted in cost savings and substantial environmental benefits.
	
	
Thermax is actively implementing initiatives to increase the utilisation of renewable energy sources. The 
Company has procured 34.34 lakh units of renewable energy through an open access mechanism. The 
Company has installed a 297 kWp capacity solar PV project at Solapur and a 370 kWp solar rooftop capacity 
at the Bhosari Plant. The Bhosari plant will commence power generation from the next financial year.
	
	
Moreover, Thermax has generated 24.81 lakh units from a Solar Power, combined capacity of 2.83 MWp 
across its plants in Savli, Jhagadia, Sri City, Solapur, and Pune offices, showcasing a strong commitment to 
adopting renewable energy for its operations.
	
	
Overall, the Company has consumed a total of 59.15 lakh units of renewable power this year, demonstrating 
significant efforts to reduce its environmental impact through renewable energy adoption. The Company’s 
overall commitment to sustainability and reducing its carbon footprint is evident through its various efforts.

1.	
Describe the mechanisms in place to receive and respond to consumer complaints and feedback.
	
The organisation has initiated several measures to guarantee a secure and healthy working environment. 
These measures include the establishment of a system to receive customer complaints and feedback, which is 
managed via diverse modes such as email, transmittal letters and verbal conversations. Complaints that come 
through Thermax Channel Associates (TCAs) are diligently registered on Salesforce.com (SFDC), where they 
are reviewed by our dedicated service team. The team also records the corresponding resolutions in SFDC. 
In scenarios where the complaints are directly received from customers by our Customer Relationship Centre 
(CRC), they are immediately sent to the respective teams for relevant action. Monitoring customer complaints 
through Salesforce.com allows us to enhance our efficiency and responsiveness, while effectively identifying 
and addressing recurring issues. Hence, this strategy contributes significantly to ensuring a safe and healthy 
work environment as it effectively manages potential sources of stress and dissatisfaction.

Independent Practitioner’s Limited Assurance Report on Identified Sustainability 
Information in Thermax Limited’s Business Responsibility and Sustainability 
Report pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations 
and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015
To the Board of Directors of Thermax Limited
We have undertaken to perform a limited assurance 
engagement for Thermax Limited (the “Company”) vide 
our Engagement Letter dated May 6, 2024 in respect 
of the agreed Sustainability Information referred in 
“Identified Sustainability Information” paragraph below 
(the “Identified Sustainability Information”) in accordance 
with the Criteria stated in the “Criteria” paragraph below. 
The Identified Sustainability Information is included in 
the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report 
(“BRSR”) Section of the Integrated Report of the 
Company for the financial year ended March 31, 2024, 
pursuant to the requirement of Regulation 34(2)(f) of the 
Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) (Listing 
Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 
2015 (as amended) (the “LODR Regulations”). The 
Reporting Boundary for BRSR is on a standalone 
basis as disclosed under Question No. 13 of Section 
A of the BRSR. This engagement was conducted 
by a team comprising assurance practitioners and 
environment experts.
Identified Sustainability Information
The Identified Sustainability Information for the financial 
year ended March 31, 2024, is summarised in Appendix 1 
to this report.
Our limited assurance engagement was with respect 
to the financial year ended March 31, 2024 information 
only and we have not performed any procedures with 
respect to earlier periods or any other elements included 
in the BRSR (other than those listed as BRSR Core Key 
Performance Indicators (‘KPIs”) in Appendix 1) and, 
therefore, do not express any conclusion thereon.
Criteria
The criteria used by the Company to prepare the Identified 
Sustainability Information is the “BRSR Core” as detailed 
in Appendix 1 to this report (the “Criteria”), which is a 
subset of the BRSR, consisting of a set of KPIs / metrics 
under nine Environmental, Social and Governance 
(“ESG”) attributes, as specified by SEBI vide its circular 
SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD-SEC-2/P/CIR/2023/122 dated July 
12, 2023 (the “SEBI Circular”).
Management’s Responsibilities
The Company’s Management is responsible for 
determining the Reporting Boundary of the BRSR, 
selecting or establishing suitable criteria for preparing 
the Identified Sustainability Information, taking into 
account applicable laws and regulations including the 
SEBI Circular, related to reporting on the Identified 
Sustainability Information, identification of key aspects, 
engagement with stakeholders, content, preparation and 
presentation of the Identified Sustainability Information 
in accordance with the Criteria. This responsibility 
includes design, implementation and maintenance 
of internal control relevant to the preparation of the 
BRSR and the measurement of Identified Sustainability 
Information, which is free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error. The Management and the 
Board of Directors of the Company are also responsible 
for overseeing the Company’s compliance with the 
requirements of LODR Regulations and the SEBI Circular 
in relation to the BRSR Core.
Inherent Limitations in Preparing the Identified 
Sustainability Information
The absence of a significant body of established 
practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure non-
financial information allows for different, but acceptable, 
measures and measurement techniques and can affect 
comparability between entities. In addition, Greenhouse 
Gas (“GHG”) quantification is subject to inherent 
uncertainty because of incomplete scientific knowledge 
used to determine emissions factors and the values 
needed to combine emissions of different gases.
Our Independence and Quality Control
We have maintained our independence and confirm 
that we have met the requirements of the Code of 
Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants 
of India (“ICAI”) and the International Code of Ethics 
for Professional Accountants (including International 
Independence Standards) (“IESBA Code”) issued by the 
International Ethics Standard Board for Accountants, 
which is founded on the fundamental principles of 
integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due 
care, confidentiality and professional behavior.
Price Waterhouse Chartered Accountants LLP (the “Firm”) 
applies Standard on Quality Control 1, “Quality Control 
for Firms that Perform Audits and Reviews of Historical 
Financial Information, and Other Assurance and Related 
Services Engagements”, the International Standard on 
Quality Management (“ISQM”) 1 “Quality Management 
for Firms that perform Audits or Reviews of Financials 
180  |  #ThermaxForABetterTomorrow  
Statements, or Other Assurance or Related Services 
Engagements” and ISQM 2 “Engagement Quality 
reviews”, and accordingly maintains a comprehensive 
system of quality control including documented policies 
and procedures regarding compliance with ethical 
requirements, professional standards, and applicable 
legal and regulatory requirements.
Practitioner’s Responsibilities
Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance 
conclusion on the Identified Sustainability Information 
based on the procedures we have performed and the 
evidence we have obtained.
We conducted our limited assurance engagement 
in accordance with the Standard on Sustainability 
Assurance Engagements (“SSAE”) 3000, “Assurance 
Engagements on Sustainability Information” and 
the Standard on Assurance Engagements (“SAE”) 
3410, “Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas 
Statements”, both issued by the Sustainability Reporting 
Standards Board of the ICAI and the International 
Standard on Assurance Engagement (“ISAE”) 3000 
(Revised), “Assurance Engagements other than Audits 
or Reviews of Historical Financial Information” and the 
ISAE 3410 “Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas 
Statements”, both issued by the International Auditing and 
Assurance Standards Board (collectively referred to as 
“the Standards”). These Standards require that we plan 
and perform our engagement to obtain limited assurance 
about whether the Identified Sustainability Information is 
free from material misstatement.
A limited assurance engagement involves assessing 
the suitability in the circumstances of the Company’s 
use of the Criteria as the basis for the preparation of the 
Identified Sustainability Information, assessing the risks 
of material misstatement of the Identified Sustainability 
Information whether due to fraud or error, responding to 
the assessed risks as necessary in the circumstances, 
and evaluating the overall presentation of the Identified 
Sustainability Information.
A limited assurance engagement is substantially less 
in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement in 
relation to both the risk assessment procedures, including 
an understanding of internal control, and the procedures 
performed in response to the assessed risks.
The procedures we performed were based on our 
professional judgement and included inquiries, 
observation of processes performed, inspection 
of documents, evaluating the appropriateness of 
quantification methods and reporting policies, and 
agreeing or reconciling with underlying records.
Given the circumstances of the engagement, in 
performing the procedures referred above, we:
•	 Obtained an understanding of the assessment 
criteria and their suitability for the evaluation 
and /or measurements of the Identified 
Sustainability Information;
•	 Made enquiries of Company’s Management, including 
the various teams such as Sustainability team, Human 
Resource team, etc., and those with responsibility for 
managing standalone BRSR;
•	 Obtained an understanding and performed an 
evaluation of the key systems and processes for 
managing, recording and reporting on the Identified 
Sustainability Information as per Appendix 1 including 
at the sites and corporate office visited. This did 
not include testing of the design and operating 
effectiveness of management systems and controls;
•	 Checked the consolidation for various plants and 
corporate office under the reporting boundary (as 
mentioned in the BRSR) for ensuring the completeness 
of data being reported;
•	 Based on above understanding, the risks that the 
Identified Sustainability Information may be materially 
misstated, determined the nature, timing and extent of 
further procedures;
•	 Performed limited substantive testing on a sample 
basis of the Identified Sustainability Information at 
corporate office, and 2 plants located at Dahej and 
Pune to check that data had been appropriately 
measured with underlying documents recorded, 
collated and reported;
•	 Reviewed records and performed testing including 
recalculation of sample data to establish an 
assurance trail;
•	 Where applicable for the Identified Sustainability 
Information in the BRSR, we have relied on the 
information in the audited standalone financial 
statements of the Company for the year ended 
March 31, 2024, which were audited by another firm 
of chartered accountants under the Companies 
Act, 2013 who, vide their report dated May 10, 2024, 
expressed an unmodified opinion on those standalone 
financial statements;
•	 Assessed the level of adherence to the BRSR followed 
in preparing the Integrated Report, which includes 
the BRSR;
•	 Assessed the BRSR for detecting, on a test basis, any 
major anomalies between the information reported in 
the BRSR on performance with respect to the Identified

Sustainability Information and relevant source data/
information;
•	 Evaluated the reasonableness and appropriateness 
of significant estimates and judgments made by 
the Management in the preparation of the Identified 
Sustainable Information; and
•	 Obtained representations from the 
Company’s Management.
The procedures performed in a limited assurance 
engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less 
in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. 
Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a 
limited assurance engagement is substantially lower 
than the assurance that would have been obtained had 
we performed a reasonable assurance engagement. 
Accordingly, we do not express a reasonable assurance 
opinion about whether the Identified Sustainability 
Information have been prepared, in all material respects, 
in accordance with the Criteria.
Exclusions
Our limited assurance scope excludes the following and 
therefore we do not express a conclusion on the same:
•	 Operations of the Company other than the Identified 
Sustainability Information listed in Appendix 1;
•	 Aspects of the BRSR and data/information (qualitative 
or quantitative) included in the BRSR, other than the 
Identified Sustainability Information;
•	 Data and information outside the defined reporting 
period i.e., the financial year ended March 31, 
2024; and
•	 The statements that describe expression of opinion, 
belief, aspiration, expectation, aim or future intentions 
provided by the Company and testing or assessing any 
forward-looking assertions and/or data.
Limited Assurance Conclusion
Based on the procedures performed and the evidence 
obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes 
us to believe that the Company’s Identified Sustainability 
Information summarised in Appendix 1 to this report 
and included in the BRSR, for the financial year ended 
March 31, 2024 is not prepared, in all material respects, in 
accordance with the Criteria.
Other Matter
The BRSR section of the Integrated Report of the 
Company includes certain information pertaining to 
the financial year ended March 31, 2023 prepared on a 
consolidated basis (unless otherwise stated), which is 
not comparable which current year information and is not 
audited or reviewed.
