The main business activity of TPML 
including its subsidiaries is the creation 
of mixed-use destinations across city-
centres in India. Our portfolio currently 
comprises of retail malls (operational: 11 
msft and under-construction + expansion: 
3 msft) which are anchored by Grade 
A offices (operational: 2 msft; under-
construction: 5 msft) and luxury hotels in 
select locations. We have also successfully 
delivered residential landmarks in the past 
and currently have an ongoing project in 
Bangalore and an under-design project in 
Kolkata.
The Phoenix Mills Limited (TPML) including 
its subsidiaries is India’s leading developer 
and operator of retail-led mixed-use 
assets. The company’s assets span various 
segments, including retail, commercial 
offices, hospitality, and residential 
developments across India. TPML’s core 
focus is on customer satisfaction and 
enhancing consumption experiences. 
Instead of merely engaging in real

creating vibrant city-center consumption 
destinations, which include world-class 
retail malls, experiential hospitality, and 
value-added commercial offices.

680 cubic meters of water per day. The STP enables the mall to operate as a Zero Liquid Discharge facility by ensuring that 
no wastewater is released into the environment.
	
The recycled water is efficiently utilized for various purposes, including flushing, landscaping, gardening, and cooling tower 
operations. During FY 2023-24, the plant successfully recycled and reused approximately 64,635 kiloliters of water within the 
mall, significantly reducing the mall’s freshwater consumption and contributing to sustainable water management practices.
	
This initiative reflects TPML’s commitment to environmental stewardship and resource conservation, ensuring that its 
operations align with best practices in sustainability.

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted 
by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the 
practices adopted to manage such waste.
	
At TPML we are committed to implementing comprehensive waste management practices that prioritize environmental 
sustainability and the reduction of hazardous and toxic chemical usage.
	
Waste Management Practices:
	
1.	
Hazardous Waste:
	
TPML has established partnerships with Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and Maharashtra Pollution Control 
Board (MPCB) certified agencies to ensure the safe and proper disposal of hazardous waste. This collaboration 
guarantees that hazardous materials are managed in compliance with stringent environmental regulations, minimizing 
any potential impact on the environment.
	
2.	
Non-Hazardous Waste:
	
TPML employs a systematic approach to the segregation of non-hazardous waste into dry and wet categories. We 
have partnered with third-party vendors who specialize in recycling dry waste, ensuring that these materials are 
processed and repurposed efficiently. For wet waste, TPML utilizes on-site Organic Waste Converter Units with a 
recycling capacity of up to 1.5 tonnes per day. This process converts wet waste into nutrient-rich manure, which is then 
used for landscaping and gardening purposes within our facilities.
Reduction of Hazardous and Toxic Chemical Usage:
TPML is also focused on minimizing the use of hazardous and toxic chemicals in its operations. The company adopts 
environmentally friendly alternatives wherever possible, striving to reduce chemical dependency across its processes. This 
strategy not only helps in reducing the generation of hazardous waste but also contributes to a safer and healthier work 
environment. TPML continuously evaluates and updates its processes to incorporate more sustainable practices, aligning 
with global best practices in environmental stewardship.
Through these initiatives, TPML demonstrates its commitment to responsible waste management and the reduction of 
environmental impact, reinforcing its role as a leader in sustainability within the industry.
