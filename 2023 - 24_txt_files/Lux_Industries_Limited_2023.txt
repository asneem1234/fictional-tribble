business, rationale for identifying the same, and approach to adapt or mitigate the risk along with its financial implications, as per the following format 
S.

Rationale for identifying the risk/ opportunity
In case of risk, approach to adapt or mitigate Financial implications of 
the risk or opportunity 
(Indicate positive or 
negative implications)
1.
Health and 
Safety
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: If occupational health and safety practices 
within operations are not properly managed, they can 
expose employees to risks such as physical, ergonomic, 
respiratory, and fire incidents, ultimately resulting in 
decreased productivity and reputational damage.
Opportunity: Lux management is firmly committed 
to the health and safety of its employees and workers. 
The Company’s safety practices encompass all possible 
measures to remove or, at the very least, reduce risks to 
the health, safety, and welfare of employees, workers, 
contractors, authorised visitors, and anyone else who 
may be affected by our operations. This commitment 
truly distinguishes us as a responsible player.
A commitment to consult and co-operate with 
workers in all matters relating to health and 
safety in the workplace is practiced to ensure 
100% safety of the workforce and security of 
female employees and workers.
Wearing personal protective equipment and 
clothing and complying with management’s 
directions for health and safety are inculcated 
in workers.
To ensure the health and safety of our 
employees and workers, the Company also 
undertakes regular health camps, eye care 
camps, etc.
Negative & Positive
2.
Energy 
Efficiency
Opportunity
Managing energy consumption is an important 
focus area in the garments industry. The Company 
has implemented energy-efficient practices such as 
the installation of capacitors to improve the plant 
load factor, thereby lowering the Company’s energy 
consumption and operational costs. 
The Company uses energy-saving LED lighting systems 
across its plants. Legacy systems are replaced with 
energy-efficient advanced technology that consumes 
less energy.

(Indicate positive or

3.
Climate 
Change & 
Emissions 
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Greenhouse gas emissions contribute to global 
warming and climate change, which directly impact 
raw material prices and can lead to supply chain 
disruptions. Improper GHG management can damage a 
Company’s reputation, potentially resulting in reduced 
investments.
Opportunity: Generating power from clean and 
renewable sources can contribute to the reduction 
of greenhouse gas emissions and promote a cleaner 
environment.
The Company has established an emissions 
management strategy to accomplish its 
commitment to the environment. 
The 1 MW rooftop solar panel at the Dankuni 
facility meets 33% of the plant’s electricity 
demands. The Company is also exploring 
opportunities to enhance its capacity further.
Negative & Positive
4.
Waste 
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: The primary waste generated in operations 
processes is cloth waste. If this waste is not managed 
well, it may end up in landfills, causing negative 
environmental impact.
Opportunity: Promoting responsible sourcing of raw 
materials, employing automated cutting processes, and 
implementing waste reduction measures by reusing 
the cloth material can help reduce the Company’s 
environmental impact.
The nature of the Company’s business 
model and its operations results in negligible 
hazardous process waste, which is disposed of 
responsibly.
The Company reduces waste by optimising 
the cutting process using state-of-the-art 
technology. Further, 95% of the leftover fabric 
cuttings are resold and ultimately used for 
recycling and product creation.
Negative & Positive
5.
Well-being of 
Employees
Opportunity
Commitment to employee well-being is a crucial aspect 
of the Company’s sustainability strategy. Valuing human 
capital through a comprehensive employee value 
proposition is critical for long-term business viability 
and sustainability. Employee well-being enhances the 
quality of work, thereby boosting productivity.
The Company prioritizes promoting a holistic experience 
for employees through training, skill-upgradation, and 
employee engagement programs. Additionally, financial 
management sessions are organized on aspects such as 
group medical insurance, PF, ESIC, tax awareness, etc., 
to enhance the financial knowledge of employees.=
