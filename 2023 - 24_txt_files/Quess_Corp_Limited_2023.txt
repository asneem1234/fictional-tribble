Transformation 
& Automation
R
Constant changes 
in technologies 
and automation.
In the era of digital transformation, we give 
much importance to digital needs by constantly 
improving and updating our digital platforms.
We are constantly moving our business to digital 
and well-organised data management systems 
thereby improving and providing better customer 
services and satisfaction to our clients and 
stakeholders.
This helps us to upscale our business and better 
customer service.
Leveraging our industry domain knowledge with 
technology, helps us provide unique business 
solutions and value propositions to our customers 
with our tech-applications such as Qjobs, WorQ, 
Dash, HR modules, etc.
Positive 
Implications
2
Cyber Security & 
Data Protection
R
Data is of 
paramount 
importance, 
and ensuring its 
safeguarding is 
crucial
Our Cyber Security Council, chaired by the Chief 
Technology Officer and business IT Heads, 
meets periodically, with a specific focus on cyber 
security and data protection risks. Furthermore, 
the Committee monitors emerging practices 
and technologies to improve IT systems and 
infrastructure. Firewall and real-time security 
monitoring systems to secure our IT environment. 
Initiatives like VAPT, SIEM, DLP, MDM, etc., have 
significantly strengthened our security posture
Positive 
Implications
3
Safety at Work
R
Ensuring 
employee safety 
and security in 
a challenging 
environment to 
prevent injuries 
and casualties.
Our comprehensive Health, Safety and 
Environment Conservation Policy and the 
Emergency Procedure Policy govern procedures 
for our employee safety and incident management. 
The employee appbased HRMS tool includes an 
upgraded workflow dedicated to safety incident 
reporting. The Unified Help Desk (UHD) is 
responsible for actively monitoring and responding 
to incidents reported through the app. Mandatory 
safety training during induction and yearly 
refreshers, along with job-specific training, boost 
awareness and adherence to safety protocols

Diversity & 
Inclusion
R
Low productivity 
of the workforce 
due to the lack 
of diversity, 
inequality, talent, 
etc.
Quess is dedicated to sourcing talent from diverse 
backgrounds worldwide, fostering a distinctive 
work culture that optimizes our potential and 
enhances our customers’ productivity. Our 
Company’s commitment to Equal Employment 
Opportunity Policy reiterates the organisation’s 
commitment towards non-discrimination of 
candidates based on age, colour, sex, disability, 
marital status, race, religion and sexual 
orientation. Through our partnerships with various 
NGOs, we successfully induced PWD associates 
into the workforce. In alignment with the Prime 
Minister’s initiative for NARI SHAKTI, our 
immediate objective is to enhance gender diversity 
among core employees to 50% (currently at 36%) 
through strategic talent acquisitions by next year. 
Numerous workshops are conducted to attract 
talent in line with this goal.
Positive 
Implications
5
Climate 
Changes & 
reduction 
of Carbon 
Footprint
R
Global warming 
and Company’s 
operations might 
negatively impact 
the natural 
environment
We continue to drive key sustainability initiatives 
across our businesses, even though we are a 
low-carbon emitting company. For the year, we 
could recycle 5.3K+ kgs of paper waste and 20.2K+ 
Kgs of E-waste. Our central Kitchen waste is sent 
to state-approved biogas vendors as a part of the 
waste disposable management policy. Although 
our electricity consumption has been a key focus 
area, to further reduce our Scope 2 emissions, we 
have taken measures such as usage of LED lights 
across our multiple office locations as a part of 
green energy initiatives.
Positive 
Implications
6
Employee 
Training
R
Lack of proper 
training and skills 
in the workforce 
will lead to poor 
productivity 
& employee 
satisfaction
Our company is committed to providing utmost 
importance to proper skill development and 
upskilling of employees. Our HRMS tool provides 
mandatory learning for all employees and ensures 
every employee completes 40 hrs of learning in 
a year. HRMS tool constantly gets updated with 
new courses and modules to provide a wide range 
of knowledge to develop both technical and soft 
skills required for the growth and development 
of the employee, which boosts their productivity. 
In addition to the skill enhancement modules, 
compliance based modules such as CoC, POSH, 
Insider Trading, ESG, ERM, etc. are completed 
by all employees annually. In FY24, employees 
underwent an avg. of ~ 43 hrs of training.
Positive 
Implications
7
Compliance with 
labour laws
R
Lack of tracking 
and adherence 
to labour laws 
and regulations 
might seriously 
disrupt business 
operations, loss 
of reputation 
including fines 
and penalties
Given our diversified staffing business across 
multiple industries and sectors, there is an 
increased risk of non-compliance with regulatory 
labour requirements. Our central compliance 
team, along with the business compliance team, 
consistently monitor adherence to labour laws 
at central, state, and local levels. Important 
compliances like minimum wages, PF, ESI, PT, 
LWF, Gratuity, etc., are regularly tracked and 
reported periodically across the businesses

PRINCIPLE 4: Businesses should respect the interests of and be responsive to all its stakeholders
1. 	
Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity
The Company has identified key stakeholders as part of its ESG framework and intends to work with them to improve their well-
being and add value to the Company’s business chain. The stakeholders who are impacted economically and socially are the 
most interacted with, and whom the Company can support. The key stakeholders include customers, suppliers, government 
and regulatory authorities, investors/shareholders, employees, business partners, and the wider communities that we serve. 
As India’s leading business services provider, the Company believes that its human capital is its greatest strength. Based on the 
above, the Company has mapped and identified internal and external stakeholders, including disadvantaged, vulnerable, and 
marginalized stakeholders. Internal stakeholders have a direct relationship with the company, while external key stakeholders 
are affected by the business but do not directly work with the company. Investors are significant stakeholders with whom 
the Company shares a strong relationship and a deep understanding of their expectations. Customers reflect the Company’s 
commitment, while employees enable the creation of value for customers and the organization and enjoy fulfilling careers. 
Lastly, suppliers help deliver business value.

company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage 
such wastes.
We are committed to minimizing waste generation and fostering a circular economy. Our efforts include implementing

Footprint
Global warming and 
Company’s operations 
might negatively impact the 
natural environment
We continue to drive key sustainability initiatives across our businesses, 
even though we are a low-carbon emitting company. For the year, we 
could recycle 5.3K+ kgs of paper waste and 20.2K+ Kgs of E-waste 
. Our central Kitchen waste is sent to state-approved biogas vendors 
as a part of the waste disposable management policy. Although our 
electricity consumption has been a key focus area, to further reduce 
our Scope 2 emissions, we have taken measures such as usage of LED 
lights across our multiple office locations as a part of green energy 
initiatives.
Employee 
Training
Lack of proper training and 
skills in the workforce will 
lead to poor productivity & 
employee satisfaction
Our company is committed to providing utmost importance to proper 
skill development and upskilling of employees. Our HRMS tool

employee completes 40 hrs of learning in a year. HRMS tool constantly 
gets updated with new courses and modules to provide a wide range

completed by all employees annually. In FY24, employees underwent 
an avg. of ~ 43 hrs of training.
Compliance 
with labour 
laws
Lack of tracking and 
adherence to labour 
laws and regulations 
might seriously disrupt 
business operations, loss of 
reputation including fines 
and penalties
Given our diversified staffing business across multiple industries and 
sectors, there is an increased risk of non-compliance with regulatory 
labour requirements. Our central compliance team, along with the 
business compliance team, consistently monitor adherence to labour 
laws at central, state, and local levels. Important compliances like 
minimum wages, PF, ESI, PT, LWF, Gratuity, etc., are regularly tracked 
and reported periodically across the businesses 
Our approach to risk management 
is designed to provide reasonable, 
but not absolute, assurance that 
our assets are safeguarded and the 
business risks are being assessed 
and mitigated. All information that 
must be disclosed, is reported to 
the senior management including 
the Chairman, Group CEO, Group 
CFO, Audit Committee and the Risk

meticulously aligned with the 
provisions of the Companies Act, 
2013, and tailored to the scale, 
scope, and intricacy of its business 
operations. The Board of Directors 
has established internal financial 
controls through comprehensive 
policies and procedures, duly 
adopted by the company. These 
measures ensure the smooth and 
effective functioning of its business, 
compliance with all pertinent laws, 
regulations, and directives from 
regulatory bodies, protection of 
assets, authorization of transactions, 
prevention and detection of 
frauds and errors, accuracy and 
completeness of accounting records, 
and the timely preparation of reliable 
financial information.
Grant Thornton Bharat LLP conducts 
internal audit reviews, with the 
scope and authority stipulated by 
the Audit Committee. To maintain 
independence, the Internal Auditor 
reports directly to the Chairman of 
the Audit Committee. The Internal 
Auditor diligently monitors and 
evaluates the efficiency of the 
company’s ICS, ensuring adherence 
to laws and accounting policies. 
Management meticulously reviews 
these reports and implements 
corrective actions to bolster controls. 
Summaries of periodic audit 
findings are presented to the Audit 
Committee.
The Audit Committee, comprising 
six directors, four of whom are 
independent as mandated by Section 
177 of the Act, convenes quarterly 
to review the Internal Audit reports 
submitted by the Internal Auditor. 
The Committee meticulously 
scrutinizes and evaluates key audit 
findings to ensure the robustness 
of financial and internal controls, 
risk management systems, and 
processes. Regular audits and 
reviews serve to reinforce these 
systems. The internal auditor 
provides quarterly updates to 
the Committee on the status of 
key audit findings to ensure swift 
implementation of resolutions.
