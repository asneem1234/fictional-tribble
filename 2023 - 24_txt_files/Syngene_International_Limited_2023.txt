of the risk or

(Indicate positive 
or negative

1
Risk arising from 
inability to ensure 
adequate management 
of safety hazards within 
operations.
Risk
This risk is an inherent 
aspect of our business 
due to our storage, 
transportation, and 
handling of hazardous 
materials.
	
Safety is our top priority across all 
operations. 
	
We instil a "safety first" mindset 
from day one, supported by 
our company-wide program, 
KAVACH, which provides 
governance, training, and best 
practices. 
	
Communication campaigns and 
strict safety protocols reinforce 
safety consciousness. 
	
Near miss reporting is 
encouraged and shared across 
the organization. 
	
Safety leadership is integral 
to all line managers' roles and 
is factored into performance 
assessments and rewards. 
	
Safety behaviours and mindset 
are considered in selection and 
promotion decisions.
Negative: Safety 
hazards may 
have negative 
implications 
including loss of life, 
property, financial 
and reputation 
damage
2
Promotion of inclusion 
and diversity
Opportunity
A workforce that 
embraces diversity and 
inclusivity introduces fresh 
perspectives and varied 
experiences, fostering 
innovation for sustained 
value generation. We are 
committed to cultivating 
an inclusive workplace 
environment that values 
the uniqueness of our 
employees and promotes 
their well-being.
Not applicable
Positive: A pool of 
diverse workforce 
from different 
genders, ages, 
ethnicities, and 
special abilities 
helps drive 
innovation, 
stimulates new 
thinking, and 
creates a more 
productive 
environment 
overall.
3
Risk of non-compliance 
to environmental 
/health/ safety 
regulations leading 
to loss of license to 
operate/ reputational 
damage
Risk
Because of the nature 
of our operations, the 
company is required to 
adhere to environmental, 
health, and safety 
regulations.
Risk mitigation of regulatory non-
compliance follows a strategy that 
involves identification, resolution and 
escalation:
	
Regulations relating to 
environment, health, safety 
are monitored through a 
governance process.
	
Compliance assurance done 
through Synpliance, Compliance 
Management Tool and supported 
by a specialized legal and 
regulatory help desk, ensuring 
compliance monitoring.
Negative: Non-
compliance may 
have negative 
implications, 
including legal, 
regulatory, financial, 
and reputational 
loss
131
Annual Report FY 2024
Syngene International Limited
4
Risk arising from 
inadequate controls 
leading to loss of data
Risk
This risk is an inherent 
aspect of Syngene's 
business, given that we 
store crucial information 
on IT infrastructure.
Technology: 
A multi-layer cyber security approach 
with best-in-class cyber security 
solutions has been deployed. This 
framework is constantly reviewed and 
upgraded to address emerging threats 
of cyber attack.
Process: 
Established governance over the 
management of cybersecurity 
using international standards 
like ISO27001 with vulnerability 
assessments  regularly conducted to 
stress test the system. 
Program to monitor potential 
confidential data leakage. 
People: 
Continuous education and awareness 
of employees on cyber threats and 
phishing risk.
Negative: Non-
compliance 
can lead to 
legal, financial, 
reputational, 
and regulatory 
implications.
5
Risk arising from 
failure to uphold high 
standards of business 
integrity and ethics
Risk
As the majority of 
Syngene's clients are 
based in the U.S. and 
Europe, all contracts are 
subject to the laws of their 
respective regions.
The approach to risk mitigation has 
the following elements:
	
Anti-bribery and Anti-Corruption 
(ABAC) policy has been rolled 
out covering all employees and 
partners.
	
A structured program of 
communication and annual 
training refresher ensures 
widespread awareness of the 
policy.
	
A program of supplier 
assessments is conducted by a 
third party
	
There is constant communication 
reinforcing the importance of 
ABAC Policy.
Negative: 
Noncompliance 
can lead to 
legal, financial, 
reputational 
and regulatory 
implications.
6
Delay or disruption in 
sourcing raw materials, 
equipment and spares 
in a timely manner 
due to disruption in 
local or global supply 
chain thereby leading 
to delayed delivery 
of services to clients. 
Not able to source 
cost effectively will 
reduce Syngene’s 
competitiveness.
Risk
Syngene oversees an 
intricate supply chain that 
necessitates specialized 
sourcing abilities, punctual 
deliveries, and exacting 
specifications from its 
suppliers.
The issue of sourcing resilience is 
managed by the following program:
	
Build a local ecosystem of raw 
materials supply.
	
Aggregating demand to 
convince global suppliers to 
open local warehouses to 
support Indian CRDMO industry.
	
Develop category management 
capabilities.
	
Reviewing of demand 
projections and stock levels for 
planning and building stock at 
optimum levels. 
	
Building resilience in logistics.
Negative: This risk 
could entail adverse 
consequences such 
as business loss, 
financial setbacks, 
and damage to 
reputation.

of identifying, evaluating and controlling hazards:
	
Physical (e.g. slips, trips and falls, entanglement, noise, vibration, harmful energy sources);
	
Chemical (e.g. inhalation, contact with or ingestion of chemicals);
	
Biological (e.g. contact with allergens or pathogens such as bacteria or viruses);
	
	
The following processes are used to identify the hazards in the workplace:
	 Safety interactions and safety walks in the workplace to identify potential hazards.
	 Employee participation during weekly safety hours
	 Comparison of Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) with current practice.
	 Reviews of incident management reports
	 Reviews of safety data sheets
	 Reviews of first aid/injury records 
	 After identifying a hazard, controls are put in place to bring the Hazard to ALARP (As low as reasonably practical) state.
	
c.	
Whether you have processes for workers to report work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such risks.
	
	
Syngene has a well-established system to report any incident, unsafe condition, unsafe acts or work-related hazards. All employees must report any

Provide details of any corrective actions taken or underway to address significant risks / concerns arising from assessments of health and 
safety practices and working conditions of value chain partners.
We have taken several concrete actions to address significant risks and concerns that arose from our assessments. Our top priority is the safety and 
well-being of our suppliers and their employees. Therefore, we have implemented the following measures:
1. In order to ensure that our suppliers are complying with our health and safety standards, we have included clauses related to health and safety, 
working conditions, and sustainability requirements into all contracts. We have also added a clause for terminating the contract with top spend 
suppliers who fail to meet our expectations on sustainability issues. 
2. We have updated our Supplier Code of Conduct policy document to ensure that it includes comprehensive expectations on health and safety, 
working conditions, and sustainability. We want to make sure that our suppliers understand our expectations and are able to comply with them. 
3. We have conducted training sessions on safety and ESG for all our suppliers. These training sessions are designed to provide our suppliers with the 
knowledge and skills they need to maintain a safe working environment for their employees and to promote sustainability. 
4. We have implemented a rigorous safety assessment process for all our vendors. Our team conducts thorough safety assessments of all vendors 
and compiles a comprehensive report highlighting various observations. Vendors are then required to submit an action plan addressing the critical 
observations. The team reviews and approves the proposed actions and subsequently communicates the approved plan to the vendor. The team 
also diligently monitors the progress of the implemented actions to ensure timely compliance. We believe that this process is essential for ensuring 
that our suppliers are maintaining the highest standards of safety and sustainability.
