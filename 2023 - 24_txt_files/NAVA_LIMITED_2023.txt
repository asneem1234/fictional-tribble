implica-

1.
Energy 
Management
Risk
Ferro alloy production 
involves energy-intensive 
processes like smelting, 
refining, and alloying 
metals. These facilities 
heavily depend on 
easily accessible but 
non-renewable energy 
sources such as coal or 
natural gas. This reliance 
exposes the company 
to risks associated with 
price volatility and supply 
disruptions in these energy 
markets.
To effectively manage the risks 
associated with energy management, the 
company is undertaking the following 
approaches:
•	 Energy Efficiency Initiatives: 
Substituting HPSV fittings with 
LED lighting in boiler and cooling 
towers. Installing new aerodynamic 
and energy-efficient FRP blades. 
Introducing Variable Frequency Drive 
for the Green Briquette Screen to 
enhance electrical energy efficiency.
•	 Embracing energy-efficient 
technologies, upgrading equipment, 
and optimizing processes to decrease 
energy usage and lessen dependence 
on non-renewable energy source.

2.
Waste & 
Materials 
Management
Opportunity The production of 
ferro alloys and power 
entails the creation of 
considerable waste, 
posing potential risks 
to the environment 
and human well-being. 
Nevertheless, viewing 
this challenge as an 
opportunity, the company 
aims to demonstrate its 
dedication to sustainability 
through efficient waste 
management strategies, 
which can enhance 
its competitive edge. 
Leveraging its strategic 
location near coal mines 
and employing Fluidized 
Bed Combustion (FBC) 
technology, the company 
optimizes the utilization of 
low-grade coal waste.

3.
Ecological 
Impacts
Risk
The company's operations 
depend extensively on 
natural resources like 
manganese ore, chrome 
ore, and coal, which 
can exert substantial 
pressure on biodiversity. 
Furthermore, emissions 
of pollutants into the air, 
soil, and water during 
production processes 
underscore the inherent 
ecological threats posed by 
the company's activities.
To address the ecological risks associated 
with the company's operations, the 
following approach is being adopted:
Environmental Assessments: 
Comprehensive environmental 
assessments are conducted to 
meticulously identify and assess the 
potential ecological impacts arising 
from the company's operations. These 
assessments delve into the effects on 
biodiversity, ecosystems, and natural 
resources, providing crucial insights 
into the environmental footprint of the 
company's activities.
Biodiversity Conservation: Robust 
measures are implemented to safeguard 
and preserve biodiversity within and 
surrounding the company's operational 
zones. This encompasses various 
initiatives, including the establishment of 
protected areas, the execution of habitat 
restoration programs, and the promotion 
of sustainable land use practices.
Negative
4.
Employee 
Health & 
Safety
Risk
The manufacturing 
and power generation 
processes entail significant 
risks to employee safety. 
These industries involve 
working with heavy 
machinery, exposure to 
hazardous materials, and 
challenging conditions, 
increasing the likelihood 
of accidents, injuries, 
and long-term health 
issues for workers. As a 
consequence of these 
risks, the company may 
face regulatory penalties, 
negative publicity, 
reduced employee morale 
and productivity, and 
increased healthcare and 
compensation costs.
To mitigate the risks associated with 
employee health and safety, the 
company is implementing the following 
approach:
Safety Training and Education: The 
Company Provides comprehensive 
safety training programs to employees. 
They receive thorough safety training, 
including regular briefings, hazard 
recognition, and emergency response 
protocols, to equip them with the 
necessary competencies for safe task 
execution.
Safety Equipment and Infrastructure: 
The company invests in suitable safety 
gear, equipment, and infrastructure to 
reduce accident risks. This encompasses 
regular maintenance and inspections of 
machinery and facilities to uphold safe 
working conditions.
Risk Assessments and Controls: 
Conducting regular risk assessments 
to identify potential hazards and 
implementing controls to mitigate them. 
This may involve redesigning processes, 
implementing engineering controls, 
and establishing safety protocols and 
procedures

5.
Responsible 
Sourcing
Risk 
Nava primarily sources 
its raw materials from 
coal mining companies in 
India. However, increased 
coal prices and reduced 
coal availability have 
forced the company to 
cut back its operations. 
With diminishing coal 
supplies due to insufficient 
coal linkage, the plant 
had to obtain coal from 
alternative mines, resulting 
in higher transportation 
costs and efforts. These 
external factors can 
significantly impact the 
company, leading to 
operational disruptions and 
challenges in maintaining 
continuity. And, relying on 
suppliers who may face 
regulatory penalties for 
their environmental or 
social practices introduces 
further risk.
To address the risks associated with 
responsible sourcing, the company is 
implementing the following approach:
Enhancing Supply Chain Transparency: 
Enforcing measures to improve visibility 
and traceability throughout the supply 
chain. This encompasses thorough 
supplier due diligence, ensuring 
adherence to environmental and social 
standards, and monitoring sustainability 
performance among key suppliers.
Strategies for Risk Management: 
Formulating approaches to mitigate 
potential environmental and social risks 
within the supply chain. This could entail 
supplier diversification, establishing 
contingency plans, and fostering dialogue 
with suppliers to promote responsible 
practices.

related to EHS and Human Rights that must be adhered to by value chain partners 
(including supply chain partners), who are required to sign the COC as part of the 
contractual documentation.
The mandatory evaluation of supply chain partners based on environmental, health

The industry functions within challenging parameters, making it impractical to 
accommodate employees and workers with varying abilities due to operational 
demands. Specific tasks, physical requirements, or environmental conditions 
within the industry pose significant challenges for individuals with diverse abilities, 
rendering effective accommodation difficult to achieve.
The industry's requirements may entail tasks demanding particular physical 
prowess, dexterity, or sensory abilities that are not readily adaptable for 
individuals with diverse capabilities. Moreover, safety hazards or other constraints 
within the work environment can impede efforts to guarantee equal opportunities 
and accessibility for those with disabilities.

understand the specifics and complexities of the grievance, facilitating a transparent 
exchange of information.

and evaluation process, which may include gathering evidence, interviewing 
relevant parties, and analysing the situation from multiple perspectives to ensure 
an equitable assessment.
• Corrective actions: Following the investigation, appropriate corrective actions are 
implemented. These measures are designed to address the identified issues, rectify 
any misconduct, and prevent recurrence of similar incidents.
Through the implementation of this grievance redressal mechanism, Nava

Mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge: 
Has the entity implemented 
a mechanism for Zero Liquid 
Discharge? If yes, provide 
details of its coverage and 
implementation.
Nava has successfully implemented a comprehensive zero liquid discharge program 
as part of its commitment to environmental sustainability. The program is designed 
to eliminate all liquid waste generated by our operations, ensuring responsible 
management of water resources.
To achieve this goal, we have made significant investments in advanced treatment 
and discharge systems. These state-of-the-art systems enable us to effectively 
treat and reuse the different types of liquid waste generated during our production 
processes. 
For instance, the blowdown water from cooling towers, slag granulation water from 
the Ferro Alloy Plant, and plant washings are collected in specially lined storage 
ponds with a capacity of 15200 kilolitres per day (KLD).
The collected wastewater is utilized within our plant premises for various purposes, 
such as water wetting on roads, dust suppression in yards, gardening, and slag 
granulation at the Ferro Alloy Plant. 
We have also implemented an online effluent monitoring system to continuously 
monitor the quality of wastewater.
Furthermore, we have implemented robust wastewater treatment measures for 
domestic wastewater generated within the plant premises. Sewage treatment plants 
are in operation within the plant premises. These treatment systems effectively 
treat the domestic wastewater, and the treated water is reused for gardening and 
other industrial purposes.

practices adopted to 
manage such wastes.
Nava has adopted the following waste management practices:
Solid Waste Management Practice:
•	 Slag (From Ferro Alloy Plant) and Fly ash (from Power Plant) are main solid wastes. 
•	 After processing in Metal Recovery Plant, slag is completely reused in the form of chips 
for road making, civil construction and filling of low laying area. Granulated slag is used 
in fly ash bricks manufacturing instead of river sand.
•	 100% utilization of fly ash has been achieved in different areas like fly ash bricks 
manufacturing, embankment/dyke raising, filling abandoned mine void & stone quarry. 
•	 Free supply of fly ash to local fly ash bricks manufacturing unit.
Hazardous Waste Management Practice:
•	 Hazardous Waste like used oil, oil-soaked cotton waste & grease cotton waste, spent 
resins from DM Plant etc. are collected from different maintenance sites of the Plants & 
primarily stored in different Bins (On concrete floor of Hazardous Waste Storage Shed 
near General Store), which is disposed of to the Authorized Re-Cycler / Re-processor/ 
reused for preparation of mud gun mass.
•	 Hazardous Waste like flue gas clean residue is collected from Gas Cleaning Plant reused 
by blending with chrome ore in manufacturing of Ferro Chrome.  
• Hazardous waste management practice is going on as per Hazardous Waste Management, 
Handling &Trans-boundary movement rules 2016.
Biomedical Waste Management Practice:
•	 Waste generated from first aid centre like cotton waste, needles, syringes, ample, bottles 
etc. are collected in different type of colour containers and after treatment they are 
disposed of according to laid down procedures.
E-Waste Management Practice:
•	 Implemented e-waste management in e-waste generating different departments like IT, 
C&I, Electrical etc. E-waste collection bins are kept in each of the above departments.
•	  E-waste is disposed through registered/Authorized recyclers.
Domestic Waste Management: 
•	 Domestic Wastes generated from Guest House, Hostel, Canteen, Security Barrack & 
Colony etc are collected through mobile trolley. We have introduced different bins for 
collection of both bio- degradable and non–biodegradable on a mobile trolley.
•	 All colony residents have been trained to handle different types of waste as per our 
requirement. Automatic Mechanized Organic Waste Converter is installed to convert the 
food waste generated from colony, canteen, guest house etc to manure.

and addressing complaints. These mechanisms enable the company to swiftly respond to concerns and resolve 
potential issues to the best of its ability, demonstrating a strong commitment to customer-centric practices.
Although consumer complaints may be uncommon due to the nature of Nava's products and their intermediary usage, 
the company remains steadfast in upholding high standards, continuously enhancing its offerings, and addressing any 
consumer concerns that may arise within its operational scope.
