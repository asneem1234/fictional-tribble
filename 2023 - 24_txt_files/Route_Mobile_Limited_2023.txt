also emerged; countries across the globe 
has a sizeable elderly population who 
may not very sophisticated in operating 
phones and computers; this at the same 
time offers an incredible opportunity for 
RML through security/ scanning offerings 
and thus leading to Increasing revenue 
from our curated service offerings.
NA
Positive
2.
Talent pool
Opportunity 
and Risk
Increasing revenue from service offerings 
from cutting edge technology & products, 
enabled by our talent pool; this could also 
pose as threat as the company may lose 
in talent retention if the millennial talent 
pool is not provided with satisfactory 
career 
programs 
accompanied 
by 
industry competitive facilities at work 
place.
Talent re-

Digital 
Inclusion 
resulting 
in market 
growth
Opportunity
In order to provide access to everyone 
in society, especially those in rural areas 
and low-income households, Companies 
are making huge investments in digital 
Infrastructure 
and 
programmes 
that 
aim to narrow the digital divide. As more 
companies across various sectors are 
started using cloud-based services, the 
cloud communication market in India is 
expanding quickly. This creates various 
opportunities for RML.

With Digital 
inclusion and 
rapidly growing 
market several 
opportunities are 
created.

prepared to resist identity theft in real-
time. Additionally, it’s critical to protect 
clients from fraud and inconveniences by 
adding an additional degree of security to 
their online experience.

detection with a 
frictionless user 
experience
8.
Data 
privacy and 
Regulatory 
compliance
Risk
As we process data, we may be exposed 
to privacy breach claims. Further various 
countries have regulatory authorities for 
e.g. TRAI in India. These authorities define 
rules of the game for CPaaS players and 
changes to these regulatory requirements 
could affect business potential.
Privacy policy, 
employee

Compliance 
programme, 
Audit 
Negative: 
Claims under 
privacy laws in 
jurisdictions 
where we

element of 
increased cost 
to hire privacy 
professionals 
in different 
jurisdictions.

Threats
Risk
Increasing cyber threats can compromise 
data and operations, therefore mitigating 
cyber security risks is essential to protect

Negative: 
Potential financial 
loss from data 
breaches and

customer loyalty 
and revenue
11. Supply Chain 
Disruptions

and affect service delivery. Any disruptions 
in our telecom partner operations or 
hardware vendors, affect our ability to 
deliver quality services
Enhance our 
diversified pool 
of suppliers 
and super

b.	
If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?
As a part of on-boarding process for suppliers, we require their acceptance of the RML’s Supplier’s 
Code of Conduct. Furthermore, we insist that our suppliers adhere to our comprehensive ‘Supplier 
Code of Conduct’, which covers crucial areas such as anti-bribery, prohibition of child labour, and 
anti-harassment measures.
Additionally, a significant portion of our value chain partners comprise large telecommunications 
operators. These partners adhere to stringent sustainability standards and maintain relevant 
certifications. This partnership ensures that our sourcing practices align with sustainability principles 
and contribute positively to our environmental and social footprint.
However, it is important to note that while we prioritize sustainable sourcing, the exact percentage 
of inputs sourced sustainably is currently not ascertainable due to the varied nature of our sourcing 
practices and the complex metrics involved in sustainability assessments. We are continually working 
to enhance our data collection and analysis capabilities in this area to provide more quantifiable 
measures of our sustainability efforts.

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and 
harassment cases.
The Company has a comprehensive framework in place to protect individuals who come forward with 
complaints of discrimination or harassment, as reflected in our Whistle-blower and Prevention of Sexual 
Harassment (POSH) policies.
Our Whistle-blower Policy encourages all employees to voice concerns regarding human rights violations, 
improper conduct, or any unethical activities within the company. We assure our employees that any 
such reports made in good faith will be treated with utmost confidentiality and respect. Importantly, we 
have a strict non-retaliation clause embedded in this policy, which strictly prohibits any form of retaliatory 
action against individuals who report such incidents. We have designated a Competent Authority to 
handle these complaints, ensuring that they are addressed professionally and appropriately.
Similarly, our POSH policy is designed to prevent and address sexual harassment in the workplace. We are 
committed to providing a safe and inclusive working environment for all our employees. If an employee 
or job applicant chooses to exercise their right to make a complaint under this policy, we guarantee 
that they will be protected from any form of retaliation. This is part of our commitment to fostering a 
respectful and dignified work environment for all.
We regularly reinforce these policies and their protections during mandatory training sessions, ensuring 
that every member of our team understands their rights and the company’s commitment to uphold 
them. We also continually review and update our policies in accordance with evolving laws and societal 
standards to make sure we are providing the best possible protections for our employees.
9.	
Do human rights requirements form part of your business agreements and contracts?
Yes. Our commitment to upholding human rights extends not just to our own operations, but also to 
our business relationships. As such, we have incorporated human rights requirements into our business 
agreements and contracts.
Our Supplier Code of Conduct, which forms a standard clause in all our contracts, explicitly outlines our 
human rights expectations. Our major suppliers, including those providing IT support, staffing solutions, 
facility management, and security services, are bound by this Code. This is especially significant for those 
suppliers that employ individuals from more vulnerable demographics with lower literacy levels.
We make every effort to ensure our partners are well-informed about our Supplier Code of Conduct and 
the human rights requirements it entails. We emphasize the importance of these standards not only 
in initial contract negotiations but also in our ongoing business relationships. Our partners’ adherence 
to these standards is a key component of our decision-making when selecting and retaining suppliers.
Furthermore, we monitor compliance with these standards regularly and take necessary action in the 
event of non-compliance. This diligent approach is part of our commitment to promote human rights 
across our business ecosystem and to contribute positively to all communities we interact with.

Sexual Harassment 
At Route Mobile, our value chain primarily consists of large telecom partners 
who are recognized for their robust policy frameworks that uphold ethical 
corporate behaviour in accordance with international benchmark practices. 
This ensures that the vast majority of our value chain is governed by stringent 
ethical standards, reflecting our own commitment to corporate responsibility 
and integrity.
Our Supplier Code of Conduct is a crucial component of our contractual 
relationships, underpinning our interactions with all our partners, suppliers, 
and vendors. It’s not just a document; it’s a commitment that forms a standard 
clause in all our contracts, reinforcing our collective responsibility to uphold 
ethical practices.
While we trust in our partners’ established policy architecture, we also believe 
in proactive measures to ensure compliance. Therefore, we are taking steps 
towards assessing the adherence of our value chain partners to our Supplier 
Code of Conduct, thus further ensuring that our commitment to ethical 
practices is consistently upheld across our entire value chain.
