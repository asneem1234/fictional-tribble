concerns. Generation of power from renewable energy sources such 
as wind avoids usage of depleting scarce resources such as fossil fuel 
or water and it does not cause any emissions. OGPL is in the business 
of generation of power from renewable energy sources and thus not 
only contributes to reduction in greenhouse gas emissions but also 
play its role to propel economic growth in a greener manner. OGPL is 
conscious of its responsibility to the society and has deeply embedded 
Environmental and Social Governance (ESG) principles in its process 
and all activities are carried out in a responsible manner following these
