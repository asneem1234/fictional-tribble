Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report
for the year 2023-24
The Tata Group’s culture inherently embraces sustainability as a foundational value that is embedded in the strategic plans 
and operations of each of its companies. As a part of the Group, the Company is equally committed towards this front and 
strives to create enduring impacts on the environmental, social, and economic ecosystems that sustain our business and 
maximize value creation for all its stakeholders.
While we place a strong emphasis on expanding our brand presence to meet evolving customer needs, we are responsible 
as both an employer and market player. Our commitment to nurturing a diverse portfolio of growth initiatives is reflected 
through our efforts to establish responsible practices across the value chain. We aim to develop a compelling portfolio of 
lifestyle brands, prioritizing responsible growth to meet the demands of the market.
Building upon insights gained from stakeholder engagements and materiality assessments, we have formulated a 
Sustainability strategy to guide our operations in the coming years. Our strategy is anchored in our overarching vision: 
Touch lives across choice markets with a portfolio of fashion & lifestyle brands that are fresh, responsible and bring 
joy to all. This vision propels us towards a future where sustainability forms an inherent part of everything we do, shaping 
our operations and driving positive impact across the value chain.
This strategy is underpinned by three strategic ESG pillars, namely, Be Resource Efficient, Be Responsible by Design and 
Be People Conscious. Each of these pillars addresses key material issues identified by the business and its stakeholders.
Under these three pillars, we delve into forays of energy management, emission reductions, waste management, principles 
of circularity, as well as social considerations such as People Well-Being, Diversity & Inclusion, and Community development 
to name a few. Notably, beyond our own operations, these initiatives are spread across our value chain through regular 
engagements and assessments. These pillars serve as guiding principles for our operations and business practices, 
ensuring that our efforts are directed towards creating long-term value for the business and its stakeholders.
Our Sustainability agenda is driven by the Company through an internal Sustainability team consisting of cross-functional 
expertise under the oversight of the Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainability (CSR&S) Committee and the Board. 
The Risk Management Committee oversees our ESG risks and mitigation actions. Compliance is followed in letter and spirit 
integrating the Tata Code of Conduct into every facet of the business.

on Responsible by Design pillar. We comply with the Sedex Member Ethical Trade Audit (SMETA) 
requirements for sustainable operations and supply chains and are a member of the Better Cotton 
Initiative (BCI), actively supporting sustainable cotton farming/production methods. Our Vendor 
Code Conduct that provides framework for ethical and responsible business practises by the value 
chain partners was implemented during the year. 
Our social efforts are guided by the Be People Conscious pillar. The well-being, professional 
growth, and safety of our workforce take precedence above all else. As advocates for equal 
opportunities, we uphold fair and equitable hiring procedures. Furthermore, we are dedicated to 
implementing certified health and safety protocols, to foster a safe workplace environment.   
The Company continues its CSR initiatives in education, employability, and entrepreneurship with 
our employees actively participating in volunteering programs to improve the lives of underserved

Enshrined in the TCoC are 5 values i.e. Integrity, Responsibility, Excellence, Pioneering and Unity, articulated by the Group’s

In addition to adhering to the principles outlined in the TCoC, Trent’s operational framework is bolstered by a comprehensive

by the Board, serve as foundational pillars that underpin our operations and guide decision-making processes.

PRINCIPLE 2 BUSINESSES SHOULD PROVIDE GOODS AND SERVICES IN A MANNER THAT IS SUSTAINABLE AND 
SAFE
At Trent, our emphasis on responsible and ethical fashion practices is demonstrated in our use of responsible materials, 
a practice that resonates with a new wave of conscious consumers and stakeholders who seek to integrate sustainability 
into their lifestyles. As a member of the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI), we have initiated the use of fabric made of cotton that 
is sustainably produced and currently around 2% cotton we use comprises of BCI cotton. Better Cotton stands out for its 
traceability, enabling the end product to be tracked back to its sources and sustainable practices.
In another move to incorporate responsible materials in our processes, we are working to replace the use of conventional 
viscose with responsible viscose. This raw material comes from wood pulp sourced from sustainably managed forests, 
certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and Birla Cellulose. Such ongoing transition to FSC viscose enables us to 
support bio-diversity conservation and local communities, reinforcing our commitment to environmental protection.
Alongside incorporating responsible raw materials in our products, we also emphasize responsible processes. Notably, we 
have introduced LiveGood, our responsible product label for apparel. LiveGood embodies our commitment to responsible 
practices, ensuring that every product bearing this label adheres to rigorous criteria across material sourcing, vendor 
selection and production processes.

growth. Our supplier selection process primarily involves assessment of suppliers aligned with SMETA 4 pillars 
focused on Labour Standards, Health & Safety, Environmental Assessments and Business Ethics. By incorporating 
these comprehensive aspects into our supplier assessments, we aim to build a strong and sustainable supply 
chain. Our Vendor Code of Conduct that provides framework for ethical and responsible business practices by the 
value chain partners was implemented during the year. 
	
Further, as a member of the BCI we intend to support ethical and transparent practices in cotton cultivation, 
processing and garment creation.
	
Our strategy further encompasses initiatives to enhance operational efficiency, optimize sourcing locations, make 
informed fabric selections, streamline our supplier network, ensure social compliances and leverage technology 
for overseeing production and quality milestones.

Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end 
of life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.
	
We have implemented certain circular waste management practices, wherein waste generated within the Company 
is recycled or repurposed to produce new products that may even be re-integrated into our daily operations. Our 
processes to manage various types of waste include:
(a)	 Plastics (including packaging): The Company utilizes plastic and cardboard boxes for product packaging; 
however, it is important to note that none of this packaging reaches customers, as the products are sold without 
it. To address environmental concerns and promote responsible waste management, we have established a 
partnership with an Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) registered plastic recycling vendor. This vendor is 
not only dedicated to recycling plastic bags but also actively engages in the responsible handling of paper waste, 
specifically cardboard boxes.
(b)	 E-waste: All electronics related disposals within the Company are exclusively entrusted to an e-waste certified 
supplier, ensuring safe disposal practices with minimal environmental impact.
(c)	 Garments Tags – Conversion from plastic to recycled paper to reduce plastic usage.
4.	
Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes / No). If yes, whether 
the waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to Pollution 
Control Boards? If not, provide steps taken to address the same.
	
Yes. The Company is registered as the Brand owner and Importer on EPR portal of Central Pollution Control Board 
(CPCB). The waste collection plan is in line with the EPR plan submitted to CPCB.
	
The Company has taken several measures to address the responsible disposal of plastic waste generated in our stores 
and distribution centres, We collaborate with vendors for waste collection and recycling. Further, to advance circularity, 
we purchase biodegradable bags, recycled cardboard, and paper from them. Additionally, we have introduced 
rice-paper bags as an option to LDPE plastic bags and use recycled paper tags on our products. 
	
Our commitment to sustainable waste management also encompasses waste reduction initiatives. For example, fabric 
waste from apparel production is transformed into Do Good Bags, providing opportunities to women from marginalized 
communities to build livelihoods and improve their lives. This initiative has prevented around 0.40 million sq. meters of 
fabric from reaching landfills and polluting land. Additionally, this initiative also resonates with our evolving customers 
who prioritize investing in businesses that contribute positively to the planet and society.

feedback, and knowledge-sharing are also accorded high importance, to enhance both personal and professional 
growth.
	
Learning and Development strategy, known as Sustainable Performance Excellence and Employee Development 
(SPEED), is designed to foster a Learning Organization where employees are empowered to drive their own learning 
journey. We leverage technologies for online and mobile based learning e.g., Seekho App and Z Learn app for store 
employees, making these readily available for our people to access at their convenience. Learning initiatives follow an 
annual calendar and are followed up with feedback and reviews for further development and improvement.
	
The implementation of Learning and Development strategy follows a three-pronged approach:
Ø	
Align: Learning is tailored to meet individual, functional and organizational priorities, driven by personal 
development plans and stakeholder meetings.
Ø	
Equip: Employees are empowered to take charge of their learning, with a focus on developing leadership qualities 
and enabling career progression. We encourage a learning mix that comprises primarily of experiential learning 
supplemented by peer learning and structured learning.
Ø	
Sustain: Learning is continually supported with effectiveness reviews, improvement measures and integration 
into performance reviews, with guidance from line managers and heads of departments.
	
Trainings on Safety
	
Timely and regular safety training is essential for minimizing accidents among the employees. These sessions provide 
valuable insights into their working environment, potential risks and effective prevention measures. As a critical 
component of the identification and management of workplace risks, employees receive Health and Safety training as 
part of the induction process when joining the Company. Additionally, they are trained to follow the Safety Reporting 
System to raise alerts about unsafe conditions on iSafe, the Incident Reporting application.
	
Moreover, the Company’s associates undergo training to ensure they understand the process and importance of 
reporting all incidents and injuries to the HSE team. This proactive approach aims to prevent unsafe behavior, address 
unsafe conditions in the workplace, and mitigate the occurrence of adverse incidents. Women’s Safety Training, Two-
Wheeler Safety Training and Fire & First Aid Safety Training are the major trainings provided to all employees.
	
The employees are also imparted training on the Tata Group’s Accelerated Reduction in Repeat Events (ARRE) for 
enhanced H&S awareness, air quality monitoring, water quality testing, ergonomics review etc. and quarterly servicing 
of air conditioning filters. Ensuring luminosity at workstations is above compliance standards.

PRINCIPLE 6: BUSINESSES SHOULD RESPECT AND MAKE EFFORTS TO PROTECT AND RESTORE THE 
ENVIRONMENT
Environmental protection is fundamental to the ethos of the Tata Group and is deeply ingrained in our pledge to craft our 
brands with responsibility. Our dedication to safeguarding the natural ecosystem is steered by the Company’s Environmental 
and Sustainability Policy.  The Company acknowledges the substantial impact that businesses can have on the environment 
and society and is dedicated to minimizing its ecological footprint and conducting operations responsibly, with the goal of 
creating enduring value for shareholders, the communities it serves, and the overall well-being of the planet.
Our focus lies in minimizing energy consumption, augmenting our utilization of renewable energy sources, and diminishing 
our carbon footprint. The demand for energy in our operations primarily arises from the needs for lighting, cooling, and 
connected load. Alongside energy conservation efforts, we place a strong emphasis on energy efficiency. We persistently 
drive various initiatives aimed at reducing power consumption through the adoption of efficient energy management 
strategies. We prioritize reducing carbon emission and have established systems to assess energy consumption and 
estimate emissions across our operations. We also emphasize resource efficiency in areas such as sourcing, product design, 
packaging, etc., to transition from linear to circular business processes. To this end, we aim to reduce energy consumption 
by approx. 50% per square foot of occupied space and increase our utilization of renewable energy sources. 
Currently, the energy we consume in our operations mainly comprises of grid-purchased electricity from non-renewable 
sources, as well as some amount of fuel consumption through DG sets at our various locations. Aiming to increase the share 
of renewables in our energy mix, we have invested in solar energy to power two of our distribution centres. We are also 
reducing energy use across our whole value chain - including our own operations and logistics activities and throughout our 
supply chain. Further to enhance energy efficiency at our stores, we’re deploying Internet of Things (IoT) and energy-saving 
technologies.

Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report
10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted 
by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the 
practices adopted to manage such wastes.
	
Recognizing the need to address the responsible disposal of plastic waste generated in our stores and warehouses, 
we have collaborated with vendors for waste collection and recycling.  We have officially registered as the brand owner 
on the EPR portal of the CPCB.
	
In line with our dedication to circularity and reducing our environmental footprint, we procure biodegradable bags, 
recycled cardboard, and paper from our suppliers. Embracing innovation, we have introduced rice-paper bags as an 
eco-friendly alternative to traditional LDPE (Low Density Polyethylene) plastic bags and utilize recycled paper tags on 
our products.  
	
Our efforts in being resource efficient  are supported by our commitment to creating circular economies. The principles 
of reduce, repurpose/ reuse, and recycle underpin our approach to managing waste generated in our operations 
sustainably. Further, a centralized waste management system that enables improved traceability of waste supports our 
endeavors to segregate and dispose different types of waste appropriately. While hazardous waste is safely disposed 
through authorized vendors, non-hazardous waste is either recycled, or safely disposed through appropriate channels. 
In FY 2023-24, recycling of non-hazardous waste comprising plastic, metal, paper, and corrugated material from around 
200 of our stores ensured that we sent zero waste to landfills.
	
Plastic packaging plays a crucial role in ensuring product safety and efficient distribution within the Company’s logistics 
operations. Recognizing this, the Company is actively transitioning towards sustainable packaging solutions. One 
significant step in this direction is the adoption of compostable plastic, which offers multiple environmental benefits. By 
incorporating compostable plastic into our packaging, we’re reducing our reliance on non-biodegradable materials and 
promoting a circular economy.
	
The Company is taking strides to minimize paper waste by re-considering the use of cardboard boxes in its logistics 
fleet. Instead, we’re exploring innovative alternatives such as plastic totes for transporting goods to reduce paper 
waste.
	
Our commitment to sustainable waste management also encompasses waste reduction initiatives. For example, fabric 
waste from apparel production is transformed into Do Good Bags, providing opportunities to women from marginalized 
communities to build livelihoods and improve their lives. This initiative has enabled productive usage of around 0.40 
million sq. meters of fabric. Additionally, this initiative also resonates with our evolving customers who prioritize investing 
in businesses that contribute positively to the planet and society.

Independent Assurance Statement to Trent Limited on select non-financial sustainability disclosures in the Business 
Responsibility and Sustainability Report for the financial year 2023-24.
Introduction and objective of engagement
Trent Limited (the ‘Company’) has developed its Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) (the ‘Report’) 
based on the BRSR reporting guidelines including the BRSR Core indicators prescribed by SEBI for listed entities. The 
reporting criteria have been derived from the Principles of National Guidelines on Responsible Business Conduct (NGRBC), 
and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol - A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard.
BDO India LLP was engaged by the Company to provide independent assurance on BRSR Core indicators of the Report that 
includes the Company’s performance for the period 1st April 2023 through 31st March 2024.
The Company’s responsibilities
The report content and its presentation are the sole responsibilities of the management of the Company. The Company 
management is also responsible for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal controls relevant to the 
preparation of the Report, so that it is free from material misstatement.
BDO’s responsibilities
BDO’s responsibility, as agreed with the management of the Company, is to provide reasonable assurance on the non-
financial information of the BRSR Core indicators as described in the ‘Scope & boundary of assurance’ section below. We 
do not accept or assume any responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person or organization. Any reliance a third 
party may place on the Report is entirely at its own risk.
Assurance standard
We conducted our assurance engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 
3000 (Revised), “Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information” and ISAE 3410, 
“Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statement” issued by the International Auditing and Standards Board. We 
applied the criteria of ‘Reasonable’ assurance.
Scope & boundary of assurance
We have assured non-financial information of the BRSR Core indicators1 in the Report, pertaining to the Company’s 
performance for the period 1st April 2023 through 31st March 2024.
The reporting scope and boundary cover the Company’s operations. Verification of non-financial sustainability performance 
data was conducted at the following sites, on sample basis, based on our professional judgement:
-

Independent Assurance Statement

Assurance methodology
Our assurance process entails conducting procedures to gather evidence regarding the reliability of the disclosures covered 
in the assurance scope. We conducted a review and verification of data collection, collation, and calculation methodologies, 
and a general review of the logic of inclusion/ omission of relevant information/ data in the Report. Our review process 
included:
▪- 
Evaluate and assess the appropriateness of the quantification methods used to arrive at the non-financial sustainability 
information of the BRSR Core indicators in the Report;
▪- 
Review of consistency of data/information within the report as well as between the report and source;
-▪ 
Engagement through discussions with personnel at both corporate and business unit levels who are accountable for 
the data and information presented in the report;
▪- 
Execution of an audit trail of claims and data streams, to determine the level of accuracy in collection, transcription, and 
aggregation;
▪- 
Review of data collection and management procedures, and related internal controls.
Inherent limitations
There are inherent limitations in an assurance engagement, including, for example, the use of judgment and selective testing 
of data. Accordingly, there are possibilities that material misstatements in the sustainability information of the BRSR Core 
indicators in the Report may remain undetected.
The assurance scope excludes:
-	
Data and information outside the defined reporting period (1st April 2023 to 31st March 2024);
-	
Review of the ‘economic and/or financial performance indicators’ included in the Report or on which reporting is based; 
we have been informed by the Company that these are derived from the Company’s audited financial records;
▪- 
The Company’s statements that describe the expression of opinion, belief, inference, aspiration, expectation, aim, or 
future intention.
Our observations
The sustainability disclosures of the Company, as defined under the scope and boundary of assurance, are fairly reliable and 
the Company has appropriately consolidated data from different sources at the central level. The Company may consider 
adopting standardised protocols for data management and reporting of environmental data across all the units.
Our conclusion
We have reviewed the select non-financial sustainability disclosures of the BRSR Core indicators in the “Report” for the 
reporting period from 1st April 2023 through 31st March 2024.
Based on the scope of our review, we conclude that the non-financial sustainability disclosures as mentioned in ‘Scope and 
boundary of assurance’ reasonably fulfil the criteria of relevance, completeness, reliability, neutrality, and understandability.

Services, to both domestic and international organizations across industry sectors. Our non-financial assurance practitioners
