(Indicate 
positive or 
negative 
implications) 
1. Health and 
Safety 
Risk 
Due to the hazardous 
nature of chemical 
manufacturing, there is a 
significant risk of harm 
to employees, and local 
communities. Ensuring 
rigorous health and 
safety measures is 
critical to prevent 
accidents, protect lives, 
and maintain regulatory 
compliance. 
The Company places top priority on ensuring 
the Health and Safety of its workforce. 
The Safety department drives a strong safety 
culture through: 
i. 
Conducting plant safety inspections, 
safety audits, and addressing unsafe 
actions or conditions; 
ii. 
Regular 'Toolbox talks' focused on safety 
norms and Learning from Incidents 
(LFI), along with periodic training and 
awareness sessions; 
iii. 
Providing appropriate personal protective 
equipment (PPE) to employees. 
iv. 
Ensuring adherence to Management of 
Change (MOC) requirements through 
HAZOP (Hazard and Operability Study) 
v. 
Regularly reviewing and updating Safety 
Plans and Manuals; and 
vi. 
Implementing Process Safety 
Management (PSM) elements. 
 
Senior management also periodically reviews 
these risks and ensures effective mitigation 
measures are in place. Additionally, the 
Company has an occupational health and safety 
management system in place for all employees 
and contract workers. Regular mock drills and 
departmental health, safety, and environment 
committee meetings ensure facilities are 
continually updated and improved. Health 
awareness initiatives, including emails on 
seasonal and lifestyle diseases, training 
programs, and super-speciality camps, are 
conducted throughout the year. For more 
details, please refer to Principle 3, Essential 
Indicators 10 and 12. 
 
Negative: 
Potential costs 
include those 
associated with 
accidents, legal 
penalties for 
non-
compliance, 
and increased 
insurance 
premiums.

(Indicate

2. Efficiency of 
Operations on 
Account of 
Old Vintage 
Plants 
Risk 
The age of our plants 
contributes to poor 
energy efficiency, 
frequent breakdowns, 
unsafe and weak 
structures, high 
maintenance costs, and 
inadequate infrastructure 
to implement state-of-
the-art manufacturing 
processes. 
The Company mitigates these risks by: 
• 
Periodically revamping and 
refurbishing plants to maintain 
operational efficiency. 
• 
Following a scheduled 
maintenance plan to prevent 
unexpected breakdowns. 
• 
Upgrading infrastructure with 
the latest equipment to 
implement modern 
manufacturing technology. 
• 
Conducting regular safety audits 
and inspections to identify and 
rectify potential hazards. 
• 
Carrying out periodic risk 
assessments, with senior management 
reviewing and ensuring the 
implementation of necessary 
mitigation measures. 
Negative: High 
operational 
costs due to 
inefficiencies, 
potential 
production 
losses, and 
increased 
maintenance 
expenses. 
3. Employee 
Development 
Opportunity 
The sustainable growth 
of the organization is 
highly dependent on the 
quality of its human 
resources. The Company 
believes that having a 
competent, talented, 
knowledgeable, and 
skilled workforce is 
crucial to achieving its 
business objectives. 
 
Positive: The 
Company is 
committed to 
continually 
improving its 
human capital 
by investing in 
the 
professional 
development 
and well-being 
of employees. 
This results in 
a more 
engaged, 
productive 
workforce, 
driving long-
term business 
success. 
4. Energy 
Efficiency,

carbon

Opportunity 
Climate change is a 
glaring global risk. 
The processes of the 
Company are energy-
intensive. Increasing the

windmills and

5. Water 
consumption 
Both 
The Company’s 
operations are highly 
water-intensive and 
depend heavily on 
freshwater sources. This 
poses a risk due to the 
potential scarcity of 
water, which could 
disrupt operations. 
However, there is also 
an opportunity to 
contribute to the circular 
economy by treating and 
reusing wastewater. 
The Company has implemented various 
measures to address water consumption, 
including rainwater harvesting and the 
development of green zones at all 
manufacturing locations to improve the water 
table. Additionally, the Company has 
undertaken a project for the treatment of 
wastewater (TTWW) to minimize water usage 
and enhance sustainability. 
Negative: 
Water scarcity 
could 
significantly 
impact the 
Company's 
operations, 
leading to 
potential 
production 
losses and 
increased 
costs. 
 
Positive: 
Investments in 
water 
conservation 
and 
wastewater 
treatment can 
reduce 
operational 
risks, improve 
sustainability, 
and possibly 
result in cost 
savings over 
time. 
 
6. Community 
Development 
Opportunity 
As a responsible 
corporate citizen, GSFC 
integrates CSR into its 
core business activities, 
having undertaken CSR 
initiatives well before 
the mandate under the 
Companies Act, 2013. 
These initiatives aim to 
enhance the Human 
Development Index of 
the country through 
efforts in education, 
women empowerment, 
 
Positive: The 
Company’s 
CSR activities 
contribute to 
social 
betterment, 
enhance its 
reputation, and 
strengthen 
community 
relations,

7. Governance, 
Risk 
Management 
and 
Compliance. 
Risk 
The Company's 
performance is 
significantly influenced 
by external factors such 
as weather patterns, 
government subsidies, 
raw material prices, 
market volatility, and 
geopolitical conditions. 
Effective risk 
management is essential 
for maintaining 
consistent performance. 
Additionally, adherence 
to laws and regulations 
is critical for responsible 
conduct and long-term 
sustainability. The 
regulatory landscape is 
dynamic, necessitating 
ongoing compliance 
efforts. 
The Company’s Board of Directors and 
senior management have established robust 
governance practices and a comprehensive 
risk management system.  
 
This includes: 
 
• 
Regular reviews and updates of 
systems, processes, corporate 
governance practices, internal 
controls, and standard operating 
procedures to align with 
industry best practices. 
• 
Obtaining certifications for 
quality and environmental 
standards. 
• 
Implementing a risk 
management framework for 
identifying, assessing, and 
mitigating risks, with periodic 
reviews by senior management. 
• 
Establishing and continuously 
monitoring a compliance system to 
ensure adherence to laws and 
regulations. Any identified lapses or 
gaps are addressed by strengthening 
internal systems. 
Negative: 
Failure to 
manage risks 
and comply 
with laws can 
lead to 
significant 
financial 
losses, 
regulatory 
penalties, and 
reputational 
damage.

to management, which are then reviewed and addressed based on their merits.  Additionally,
