26.	 Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues
Please indicate material responsible business conduct and sustainability issues pertaining to environmental and social matters that 
present a risk or an opportunity to your business, rationale for identifying the same, approach to adapt or mitigate the risk along-with 
its financial implications, as per the following format
Sl. 
No.

(R/O)
Rationale for identifying 
the risk/opportunity
In case of  risk, approach to adapt or

Financial implications of the 
risk or opportunity (Indicate  
positive or negative 
implications)
1
Pollution
Risk
The manufacturing 
processes can result in 
the release of harmful 
chemicals and waste 
into the environment, 
contaminating air, water, 
and soil. This pollution not 
only endangers ecosystems 
but also has potential 
health implications for 
communities living nearby.
We are continuously identifying 
opportunities to effectively manage our 
environmental impact through pollution 
control measures.
We are continuously monitoring our air 
emissions, GHG emissions wastewater 
generation. We are focusing on efficient 
water consumption, reducing water 
withdrawal and increasing water 
recovery. For waste management, we 
are focusing on increasing the share 
of recycling and reuse within our own 
operations, and co-processing of 
hazardous waste.
Negative
Air and water contamination 
can lead to health and 
safety issues for surrounding 
communities, flora and fauna, 
and  lead to adverse legal, 
regulatory and financial 
consequences, loss of 
reputation and stakeholder 
trust, ultimately leading to a 
loss of license to operate.
2
Water 
Management
Opportunity
By continuing high water 
consumption in areas of 
water stress, the risk of 
increase in operational 
costs continue to rise, 
this can lead to issues in 
manufacturing capabilities 
which can lead to an overall 
loss in revenue.
We have established targets to recycle 
water consumption by 50% by 2030. We 
have implemented Zero Liquid Discharge 
at 6 of our sites and treating any waste 
water produced during manufacturing.We 
are also taking steps for responsible use 
of water in areas of high water stress we 
aim to reduce the water burden.
Negative
Increased water stress may 
affect nearby communities 
and productivity of 
manufacturing sites leading 
to regulatory and financial 
consequences.

3
Pharmaceuticals 
in environment/
Anti Microbial 
Resistance 
(AMR)
Risk
Inaction from Lupin as a 
pharma company towards 
AMR stewardship can 
lead to loss in reputation 
which in turn leads to loss 
in customer loyalty and 
customers.
We actively assess the ecological impact 
of the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients 
(APIs) used in the manufacturing 
processes, discharge into water 
bodies, potential bioaccumulation 
in ecosystems, and overall toxicity to 
organisms. We frequently analyze the 
Anti Microbial contents in the treated 
water discharges and ensure that the 
PNEC values of those AMRs are below 
the limit of quantification. 6 out of 13 
manufacturing plants are Zero Liquid 
discharge plants where in the treated 
effluent is recycled in the utilities 
and there is no discharge outside 
the premises. Additionally, we are 
undertaking life cycle assessments of 
Top-10 revenue generating products 
across the value chain to understand 
the cumulative environmental impact 
of APIs in the cradle to gate approach. 
The life cycle assessments will help us to 
assess the opportunities for reducing the 
ecological footprint.
Negative
AMR can leads to higher 
mortality rates as infections 
that were once treatable 
become resistant to 
antibiotics, making them 
harder to cure, resulting 
in prolonged illnesses and 
increased complications. 
Resistant bacteria can spread 
within communities and 
healthcare settings, leading 
to outbreaks that are difficult 
to control.
4
Waste 
Minimization
Risk
Directing more waste to 
landfills and incinerators 
will increase the company’s 
contribution to air pollution 
and GHG emissions, along 
with underground water 
eutrophication. 
Our approach to waste management 
is guided by the 3R principle of ‘Reduce, 
Reuse and Recycle. Our waste streams, 
which include hazardous waste, non-
hazardous waste, e-waste, biomedical 
waste, and others, are inventoried 
periodically and are sent to third parties 
for recycling/disposal in compliance with 
applicable government regulations. 
Negative
Improper waste management 
can lead to material wastage, 
fines and compliance 
penalties.
5
Green 
Chemistry
Opportunity
Investing in green chemistry 
and inculcating sustainable 
manufacturing processes 
can lead to an optimized 
and efficient manufacturing 
process. This can have a 
positive impact on revenues 
and in turn help increase 
investments in better tools 
and technologies.
Positive
By bringing down product 
carbon and water footprints, 
reducing use of hazardous 
chemicals and solvents 
and replacing them with 
renewable green solvents 
and feedstocks, we stand to 
benefit both environmentally 
and economically.
6
Customer 
Health and 
Safety
Opportunity
By providing safe and 
effective drugs the brand 
loyalty amongst customers 
increases and leads to 
greater revenues and builds 
trust between the company 
and society.
Positive
Propagating customer safety 
initiatives builds trust with 
customers, lowers healthcare 
costs and positively impacts 
revenue.
7
Occupational 
Health and 
Safety
Risk
Providing for a safe work 
environment brings about 
high levels of employee 
satisfaction and ensures 
that they can achieve their 
highest potential. Ineffective 
management of health and 
safety practices can lead 
to a high number of safety 
related incidents. An unsafe 
workplace can cause 
distress and has potential 
reputational & revenue loss 
for the organization.
All our sites are ISO18001 certified and 
have management systems in place for 
avoiding unsafe incidents. Regular training 
is given to all site teams to mitigate unsafe 
acts and report on unsafe incidents. 
Employees are encouraged to report on 
near misses and potential near misses 
to avoid any future incidents. Industrial 
hygiene & personnel safety standards are 
maintained as per global best practices to 
keep the workplace safe.
Our record state that our incident rate & 
accident rate are reducing YoY in line with 
our commitment for the same.
Positive
Having a robust strategy to 
ensure occupational health 
and safety will lead to higher 
employee productivity along 
with higher retention rates.

8
Human Rights
Risk
Without proper safeguards 
for employee human rights 
protections, the company 
will lose reputation and 
credibility in the market 
and see a drastic drop in 
revenues.
We have established policies and 
safeguards to ensure the protection 
of human rights for each of our 
employee’s and workers, our code of 
conduct outlines Lupin’s stance on the 
protection of human rights and actions 
and redressals that are available to our 
employee’s incase they feel like their 
human rights have been infringed.
Negative
Violation of human rights 
has a significant impact on 
the companies credibility 
and can lead to harsh 
penalties, litigation and 
have a significant dent on 
stakeholder confidence.
9
Human Capital 
Development
Opportunity
By providing training 
and flexibility in work 
methods to employee’s the 
company will see growth 
in all facets. This will have 
a positive contribution to 
revenues and credibility 
of the company within the 
pharma market.
Positive 
By developing resources, the 
company can lower hiring 
costs, and generate more 
internal mobility.
10
Product 
Accessibility 
and 
Affordability
Opportunity
By extending our scope 
of access to high disease 
burden nations, we can 
build positive trust within 
society. It also leads to 
greater opportunities for 
developing supply chains 
in untapped markets 
while increasing credibility 
amongst our stakeholders.
Positive
Product innovation and 
research efforts enhance the 
brand value by offering a 
wide range of products that 
are both easily accessible 
and reasonably priced. These 
products enable us to cater to 
unmet patient needs and also 
facilitates access for low and 
middle income countries.
11
Responsible 
Supply Chain 
Management
Opportunity
Having a responsible supply 
chain leads to lower costs 
in maintaining long term 
partners and an overall 
increase in revenue due 
to a more robust flow of 
products.
Positive
By responsible supply chain 
practices the company is 
ready to deal with supply 
chain disruptions brought 
on by unprecedented 
circumstances. In addition, 
the Company’s adherence 
to its responsible sourcing 
enhances its social and 
environmental performance.
12
Compliance 
(Regulatory & 
Ethical)
Opportunity
By inculcating industry best 
practices and creating 
a governance structure 
around compliance 
ensures that the company’s 
credibility remains intact.
Positive
By following best practices 
and ensuring compliance, the 
company avoids fines and 
builds trust with customers 
and within stakeholders.
13
Business Ethics: 
Anti-bribery 
and corruption
Opportunity
Ensuring that governance 
practices and policies 
are in place to maintain 
ethical business conduct 
and minimise conflicts 
of interest can lead to 
the company expanding 
business in new markets 
and having a positive 
compliance portfolio.
Positive
Having robust governance 
strategies and policies drives 
compliance and ensures 
the good standing of the 
company.
14
Data Privacy 
and Protection
Risk
Information protection risks 
have become more critical 
due to the shift to remote 
work driven by the COVID-19 
pandemic. The increased 
reliance on digital 
communication and data 
sharing has heightened 
the company's exposure to 
cyber threats. 
We are ISO 27001 certified and conduct 
regular checks of our data. We also 
provide employee’s and workers with 
extensive training on the handling 
and use of company data to ensure 
maximum protection.
Negative
An attack on Lupin’s IT 
systems or failure to comply 
with data privacy laws 
can lead to the loss of vital 
business intelligence, financial 
setbacks, and reputational 
damage.

15
Ethical 
Marketing 
and Product 
Labeling
Risk
Miscommunicating drug 
uses or prescriptions along 
with any incorrect labeling 
can cause serious harm to 
patients health and safety, 
which has reputational risks 
alongside risks related to 
loss in revenues.
By having a ethical marketing policy, 
audits and unique identifiers we ensure 
the company and its partners are able 
to identify any miscommunication 
of usages for drugs produced by the 
company.
Negative
Miscommunication and 
improper labellling of product 
use can lead to customer 
health and safety issues and 
fines.
16
Combatting 
Counterfeit 
Medicines
Opportunity
By ensuring traceability and 
authenticity of the drug 
we can create a strong 
impression in the market 
as overseers. This leads to 
a boost in the company’s 
credibility.
Positive
Curtailing the distribution 
counterfeit medicines ensures 
accountability and avoids 
product recall costs.
17
Risk

Percentage of recycled or reused input material to total material (by value) used in production (for manufacturing industry) or 
providing services (for service industry).
The nature of the Company’s business, being the production of pharmaceutical goods intended for human 
consumption, precludes the utilization of any re-used or recycled input materials in its production processes or 
product packaging. This arises from the critical imperative to ensure consumer safety and comply with applicable 
current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) mandated by regulatory bodies.
4.	
Of the products and packaging reclaimed at end of life of products, amount (in metric tonnes) reused, recycled, and safely 
disposed, as per the following format:
As part of our commitment to Extended Producer Responsibility regarding the management of post-consumer 
plastic waste, we are ensuring the recovery of a quantity of post-consumer plastic waste equivalent to what our 
products produce in India. This plastic waste is then directed towards the creation of recycled products or used as 
an alternative source of energy. Moreover, we have digitized patient information leaflets, removing them from our 
products. This step has not only cut costs but also decreased paper usage and waste.

and violation of the Company’s policies or CODE. No person has been denied access to the Chairperson of the Audit Committee. 
Teams of strategic business unit heads/officers appointed by the Ombudsperson are engaged by the Ethics and Compliance office, 
for resolution of reported cases in accordance with the Whistleblower Policy. During the year, all cases of sexual harassment that 
were reported were investigated and resolved by the Internal Complaints Committee within the specified turnaround time as per the

Details of a business process being modified / introduced as a result of addressing human rights grievances/complaints.  
Process Improvement in the vendor billing cycle: One of the observations from the location wise Human Rights audit was that, though 
the third party employees deployed by the manpower contractors were paying their employees well within the stipulated period, 
the day of the month varied across vendors. Since the permanent employees of the company were being paid on the last day of 
the month, it posed a risk wherein the third party employees would feel unfairly discriminated against, inspite of complying to all 
statutory norms of the land. Therefore, it was decided that as a proactive step, the day of payout for the third party employees also 
needed to be brought forward and made uniform across all vendors to the extent possible. 
A cross functional team of HR location leads, administration, financial shared services as well as procurement team was formed. This 
team worked towards ensuring the agreements with the manpower contractors were re-evaluated with a softer credit period as well 
as a priority payout partner on a monthly basis. The SOPs prepared by the team were presented to the leaders of these functions and 
signed off and implemented. This ensured the standardization of the payment date for the vendors and thereby for the third party 
contractual employees. This led to an improvement in engagement of these people across the India locations.

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your 
company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to 
manage such wastes.
Across our full value chain, we have adopted efficient waste management practices and embraced circularity. We focus on recycling 
waste and are committed to minimizing the amount of waste sent to landfills and incinerators. Out of our thirteen facilities, including 
those dedicated to research and development, seven send their incinerable hazardous waste to Co-processors or Pre-processors. 
In FY2024, we managed to send 89% of our incinerable hazardous waste to be co-processed. By the year 2030, our goal is to redirect 
70% of the incinerable hazardous waste generated by our operations in India to co-processing facilities like cement plants.
The spent solvents produced in the process of manufacturing Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) are either reused on-site or 
sent to certified disposal facilities or recyclers. In our efforts to conserve resources, used calcium sulphate is dispatched to cement 
factories to serve as both a raw material and an alternative fuel. Non-hazardous waste, including waste from our canteens and 
mycelia, is processed either into organic fertilizer through composting or sent to piggeries.
Our commitment to waste reduction is evident through several initiatives:
•	
Encouraging the use of non-hazardous and less toxic materials at the R&D phase or as part of our process enhancements.
•	
Enhancing our processes to increase product yields, thereby reducing waste.
•	
Providing training for our employees on the safe handling, labeling, and storage of hazardous substances.
