Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan? Give details in 100 words/ web link: 
The whole process involves a preparation plan for the impending disaster, action in response to a disaster, and support and strength to rebuild a community 
after the occurrence of a disaster. Establish role and responsibility and action to be taken by employees, service & support, security staff.  To address all the 
objectives of DMP and Risk management, activities are conducted as per guidelines of ISO 45001:2018. We are addressing HEALTH AND SAFETY 
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM in Quality Management System and OHS Manual of the company. Risk management / Health and safety committee has been formed 
for regular monitoring and implementation of any associated risk, impart trainings, conducting mock drills and executing various awareness programs. 
 
The organization has established implemented and maintained processes to: 
a. 
Assess OH&S risks from the identified hazards taking into account applicable legal requirements and other requirements and the effectiveness of 
existing controls; 
b. 
Identify and assess the risks related to the establishment, implementation, operation and maintenance of the OH&S management system that can 
occur from the issues identified in the organization context and the needs and expectations of the interest parties. 
c. 
The organization’s methodology and criteria for assessment of OH&S risks is defined with respect to scope, nature and timing, to ensure it is proactive 
rather than reactive and used in a systematic way. These methodologies and criteria is maintained and retained as documented information.  
 
As a consultancy services organization, the Company believes its financial exposure to acute physical impacts from climate change and/or other disasters is 
limited. However, there is the potential that changes in climate such as extreme weather events, storm-related flooding or extended drought could disrupt its 
clients’ projects and its work, namely its IT systems and the ability of its employees to travel, particularly in locations near or at sea level.  
 
Generally, the Company occupies modern offices in well-connected locations. It also has significant regional and national presence to ensure that all offices 
would not be disrupted by adverse climate impacts.  
 
Business continuity procedures, as well as the diverse geography of the Corporation’s locations, enable employees to work from other offices, which 
minimizes operational disruptions and keeps productivity losses to a minimum.  
 
In addition, the Company revenues are not concentrated in one specific region, which prevents regional disruptions from unduly influencing its operations. 
However, the Company does conduct outdoor field activities in the course of its projects, including but not limited to professional surveying, Owner engineer 
services, Project Management Services, field data surveys and collection, geotechnical investigations and construction oversight and inspection, and plant 
start-up, testing and operations. Extreme weather events may hinder the ability of its field employees to perform their work, which may result in delays or loss 
of revenues, while certain costs continue to be incurred. On Health and Safety front, we reported zero fatalities and accidents during the year
