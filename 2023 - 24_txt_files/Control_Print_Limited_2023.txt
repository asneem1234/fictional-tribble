Energy 
Management
Risk
Energy is essential for industrial machinery 
manufacturing, with purchased electricity 
being the main energy expense, followed 
by purchased fuels. The type of energy, 
the amount of energy used and energy 
management strategies vary based on the 
products made. The mix of energy sources—
whether generated on-site, grid-sourced or 
alternative—affects the cost and reliability 
of the energy supply, influencing the the 
Company’s cost structure and regulatory 
risk. With increasing energy costs and 
installation capex – this risk is one of the key 
environmental & cost risk.
The Company has installed an energy-
efficient Variable Refrigerant Flow (VRF) 
system for air conditioning purposes at the 
plant. It helps Control Print to reduce energy 
consumption and use of ecofriendly system 
for air conditioning.
Negative.
*There has been no 
negative impact in the

2
Workforce Health & 
Safety
Risk
Employees 
in 
industrial 
machinery 
manufacturing facilities encounter health 
and safety risks from operations of heavy 
machinery, moving equipment and electrical 
hazards. If safety practices are not adhered 
to, it can lead to higher healthcare costs, 
litigations and frequent work disruptions.
The said risk can be dealt with by enforcing 
robust safety protocols, such as incident 
reporting and investigation, and fostering a 
safety-oriented culture. The Company has 
implemented ISO 45001:2018 Occupational 
Health and Safety system at its Guwahati 
and Nalagarh plant. The Company has 
established Standard Operating Procedures 
(SOPs) that encompass the process of 
hazard identification and also provides 
periodic 
training 
to 
employees 
and 
conducts mock drills for firefighting, first aid 
and critical conditions.

Materials Sourcing
Risk
Industrial machinery manufacturers face 
significant supply chain risks when utilizing 
critical materials in their products. These 
materials often lack substitutes and are 
sourced from a limited number of countries, 
which can be affected by geopolitical 
instability. Additionally, the rising global 
demand for these materials from various 
sectors intensifies competition, potentially 
leading to price hikes and supply uncertainties.
The Company, to address these risks, place 
weekly bulk orders. By doing so, we can 
build a buffer stock that provides a backup 
in case of supply disruptions, ensuring we 
have sufficient materials to meet production 
demands. This strategy helps us avoid 
shortages and stabilize our supply chain 
despite the external challenges.
Negative.
*There has been no 
negative impact in the 
reporting 
period 
of 
FY 2023-24.

Remanufacturing 
designs and 
services
Opportunity
Industrial 
machinery 
and 
goods 
manufacturing relies heavily on materials 
like steel, iron, aluminium, glass, and plastics. 
Remanufacturing 
industrial 
machinery 
systems, 
offers 
a 
valuable 
opportunity 
for companies to reduce the need for raw 
materials in the production of new machinery. 
This approach also cuts down on the time and 
resources required to produce finished goods. 
By remanufacturing products, companies can 
derive value from items that would otherwise 
be discarded or recycled. Additionally, reusing 
end-of-life parts to build remanufactured 
machines can lead to significant cost 
savings and provide new sales opportunities. 
Integrating remanufacturing into the process 
and design phases can thus lower raw 
material demand, reduce manufacturing 
costs and open up new revenue streams.

Legal & Regulatory 
Framework
Opportunity
Implementing a robust and well-defined 
governance structure is crucial for ensuring 
effective decision-making and operational 
management within an organization. A 
strong governance framework provides clear 
guidelines and processes for making decisions, 
which helps in aligning the organization’s 
activities with its strategic goals. It establishes 
accountability and transparency, ensuring 
that all stakeholders understand their roles 
and responsibilities.
This structure also facilitates better risk 
management by identifying potential issues 
early and creating mechanisms to address 
them promptly. By having a clear governance 
framework, 
organizations 
can 
improve 
their compliance with legal and regulatory 
requirements, thereby reducing the risk of 
penalties and enhancing their reputation.
The 
Company 
has 
established 
robust 
processes which helps them to build their 
Corporate Governance journey in an efficient 
manner.

5.	
Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its coverage 
and implementation.
	
The Guwahati Unit has installed a Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) with a capacity of 7.5 kiloliters per day (KLD) and 
a Rainwater Harvesting Tank with a capacity of 20,000 liters on their premises. However, they have not yet fully 
implemented a Zero Liquid Discharge mechanism. The stepwise implementation of STP is as follows:
	
Step-1: Raw Sewage Collection Tank
	
The raw sewage collection process is crucial in sewage treatment as it removes large coarse particles. This initial 
operation is vital at treatment plants for the following purposes:
	
a.	
Eliminating floating solids that could block pumps and outfalls at treatment plants.
	
b.	
Removing solids from sewage to prevent the formation of unsightly sludge banks at disposal sites, especially 
with only primary treatment.
	
Step-2: Biological Tank
	
In the biological tank, microorganisms, including bacteria and protozoa, play essential roles. Bacteria break down 
organic matter, while protozoa help regulate bacterial levels. DAP and urea fertilizers are added every three days 
to enhance microbial activity.
	
Step-3: Clarifier Tank
	
Clarifiers are settling tanks with mechanical means to continuously remove solids deposited by sedimentation. 
They clarify and thicken liquids by allowing solid contaminants to settle at the tank bottom, collected by a scraper 
mechanism. Sludge refers to concentrated impurities at the tank’s bottom, while scum refers to floating particles on 
the liquid’s surface.

Step-4: Filters
	
Iron Filter: Functions like a water softener to capture iron precipitates, leaving water iron-free.
	
Carbon Filter: Uses granular activated carbon (GAC) to effectively remove organic chemicals from water. Chlorine 
dosing occurs before both filters to optimize treatment.
	
The Nalagarh unit also has not fully implemented Zero Liquid Discharge mechanism, but has STP installed in their 
premises which consists of:
	
a. 	
Collection Tank
	
b. 	
Biological Treatment
	
c. 	
Tertiary Treatment
	
Collection Tank: This tank holds the wastewater temporarily, allowing for initial containment and stabilization.
	
Biological Treatment: In this phase, air is diffused from the bottom through diffusers or nozzles using twin lobe 
blowers. The organic load is reduced through either the attached growth on synthetic media or a complete mix 
process facilitated by dissolved oxygen. The effluent flows from the bioreactor to the secondary clarifier, where 
it enters with an upward flow. The sludge settles at the bottom while the clear supernatant is collected at the top. 
The settled sludge is recycled back to the reactor to maintain the required level of MLSS (Mixed Liquor Suspended 
Solids), and excess sludge is removed and dried on sludge drying beds before being used as manure. The overflow 
from the secondary clarifier is directed to the filter feed tank for final treatment.
	
Tertiary Treatment: The effluent from the biological treatment stage is passed through a dual media filter (containing 
sand and carbon) using filter feed pumps. This process removes suspended and dissolved impurities before the 
final discharge. The treated effluent is then used for plantation within the unit.

Separate storage locations 
for 
waste 
have 
been 
established, ensuring that 
waste is disposed of by 
authorized 
recyclers 
in 
compliance with the policies 
of 
Extended 
Producer 
Responsibility (EPR) and 
Plastic Waste Management 
(PWM).
Waste is broadly categorized 
into Dry and Wet categories and 
then further sub-classified into 
Electronic, Plastic, Chemical and 
Metal waste.
As a result of our waste management 
initiative, we have achieved the proper 
disposition of waste through the following 
measures:
Types of Waste:
Dry Waste: Managed separately, including 
non-biodegradable materials like paper, 
plastic, glass, metals and electronics.
Wet Waste: Handled as biodegradable 
materials such as food scraps and garden 
clippings.
The sub-categories:
Electronic 
Waste: 
Efficiently 
disposed 
of, 
including 
discarded 
electronic 
devices 
and 
components. 
Plastic 
Waste: 
Properly 
managed, 
encompassing 
various 
plastic 
materials 
like 
bottles 
and 
packaging. 
Chemical 
Waste: 
Safely 
disposed 
of, 
including hazardous materials such as 
industrial chemicals and solvents.
Metal 
Waste: 
Appropriately 
handled, 
including metal scraps, old appliances, and 
containers.
Storage and Disposal of Wastes:
Separate Storage Locations: Established 
for different types of waste to prevent cross-
contamination and facilitate recycling.
Authorized Recyclers: Waste is disposed of 
through authorized recyclers, adhering to EPR 
and PWM policies, ensuring environmentally 
responsible 
processing 
and 
recycling. 
These steps have resulted in improved 
waste management efficiency, reduced 
environmental impact, and the promotion 
of sustainable practices.

Installation 
of 
Sewage 
Treatment plant
Our initiative focuses on recycling 
and reusing treated wastewater 
by 
implementing 
a 
Sewage 
Treatment Plant (STP). Here's 
how this initiative is structured: 
Treatment 
Process: 
The 
wastewater from our operations 
undergoes 
a 
comprehensive 
treatment process. Initially, it 
enters the STP where it undergoes 
anaerobic treatment followed 
by 
aerobic 
treatment 
using 
activated sludge and extended 
aeration 
processes. 
These 
processes 
effectively 
reduce 
organic 
contaminants 
and 
improve the quality of the effluent. 
Recycling 
and 
Reuse: 
Once 
treated, 
the 
wastewater 
is 
recycled 
and 
reused 
within 
our facility. It serves various 
purposes such as irrigation for 
landscaping, cooling water for 
industrial processes, or other 
non-potable uses that do not 
require high-quality water.
The 
implementation 
of 
our 
Sewage 
Treatment Plant (STP) has resulted in 
significant environmental and operational 
benefits. By utilizing a comprehensive 
treatment process that includes both 
anaerobic 
and 
aerobic 
treatments, 
our facility effectively reduces organic 
contaminants in wastewater. The treated 
effluent is then recycled and reused for 
non-potable purposes such as irrigation for 
landscaping and cooling water for industrial 
processes. This initiative not only minimizes 
the demand on freshwater resources but also 
supports sustainable water management 
practices within our operations, contributing 
to a more environmentally friendly and 
cost-effective approach to water usage.

Managing 
waste 
and 
educating 
staff 
about 
environmental 
conservation.
We have conducted diverse 
training sessions and maintained 
standard operating procedures 
(SOPs).
Through our efforts, we have achieved: 
Increased Knowledge: Employees have 
gained valuable knowledge through various 
training sessions.
 
Time 
Efficiency: 
Implementation 
of 
streamlined 
processes 
has 
reduced 
time 
consumption. 
Less Wastage: Efforts to minimize waste 
generation have led to reduced waste 
output.

automatic water level sensors in water tanks 
ensures optimal water usage, preventing 
unnecessary 
overflow 
and 
depletion. 
Efficient 
Water 
Consumption: 
The 
introduction of pressmatic water taps has 
promoted efficient water consumption, 
reducing unnecessary usage.
 
Sustainable Water Practices: Recycling and 
reusing treated wastewater through our 
STP and implementing rainwater harvesting 
systems have enabled us to utilize water 
resources sustainably.
 
Environmental Impact: These initiatives 
collectively contribute to reducing our 
environmental footprint and promoting 
responsible water management practices. 
Overall, our efforts have led to enhanced 
water management efficiency, conservation 
of natural resources, and a more sustainable 
approach to water usage within our facilities.

We have shifted from traditional 
tube lights to LED lights and 
installed timers for street lights.
To reduce energy consumption, we have 
implemented measures such as converting 
tube lights to LED lights and installing timers 
for street lights. These initiatives are aimed 
at enhancing energy efficiency across our 
operations.
