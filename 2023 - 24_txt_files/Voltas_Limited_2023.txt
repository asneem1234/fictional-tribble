Climate 
Change
Opportunity Climate change presents a chance to innovate 
smart engineering products that prioritize 
energy and resource efficiency, enhancing 
comfort in everyday living. By focusing on 
Commercial Refrigeration, the Company aims to 
curb food waste, thereby mitigating Greenhouse 
Gas (GHG) emissions associated with food waste. 
Additionally, recognising the potential rise 
in infectious diseases due to climate change, 
we have embarked on a Technology License 
Agreement to design, produce, market, and 
maintain medical refrigeration and vaccine 
storage equipment.

Climate 
Change
Risk
Evolving regulations on Greenhouse Gas 
emissions 
from 
refrigerants, 
necessitating 
the development of environmentally friendly 
alternatives may pose risk to the Company. 
Additionally, 
extreme 
weather 
events 
associated with climate change can disrupt 
supply chains and manufacturing operations, 
affecting production and distribution of our 
products. 
Furthermore, 
extreme 
weather 
events like heat stress, excess rainfall among 
employees working in manufacturing facilities 
and offices potentially reducing productivity 
and increasing absenteeism, thereby impacting 
the overall efficiency of the Company.
•	
Mandatory safety 
trainings and 
awareness sessions are 
conducted throughout 
our operations, 
project sites, and 
offices, encompassing 
emergency evacuation 
procedures during 
natural disasters.
•	
Developing smart 
engineering products 
that prioritise 
sustainability and 
energy efficiency is 
essential to meet rising 
consumer demand 
and address climate 
change concerns.
•	
Transitioning to 
clean energy for our 
business operations, 
the Company strives 
to achieve Net Zero 
emissions by 2045

Stewardship
Opportunity Implementing responsible product management 
practices throughout its lifecycle, spanning 
from design to disposal, aims to minimise 
environmental impact, thereby enhancing cost-
efficiency 
through 
streamlined 
production 
processes and waste reduction. The   Company’s 
international 
operations 
encourage 
the 
adoption of renewable energy sources and 
energy-efficient technologies among clients, 
fostering sustainability and aiding in customer 
retention while maintaining leadership in 
current markets.

Waste 
Management
Opportunity Implementing sustainable waste management 
practices and recycling initiatives not only 
enhances 
the 
Company’s 
environmental 
performance and reduces reliance on virgin 
raw materials but also holds the potential to 
yield significant financial returns. By prioritising 
efficient resource utilisation and minimising 
waste generation, we can simultaneously 
mitigate ecological impact and unlock cost-
saving opportunities, ultimately enhancing the 
bottom line.
NA

Health & 
Safety
Risk
The Company always aspires to foster a safe 
and conducive work environment for its 
employees, workers, and vendors. Health and 
Safety hazards can lead to employee injuries and 
illnesses, diminishing productivity and escalating 
associated costs, including damage to the 
Company’s reputation, ultimately affecting its 
financial performance.
Through safety campaigns 
and 
conferences, 
all 
significant 
hazards 
are 
communicated 
across 
sites, factories, and offices. 
The 
Company 
mitigates 
safety and health risks by 
empowering 
employees, 
workers, and vendors the “Will 
to stop Work”, if  they perceive 
the workplace as unsafe. 
Furthermore, the Company’s 
insurance program extends 
coverage to both employees 
and service technicians.

Sustainable 
Supply Chain
Risk
Lack of adoption of sustainable measures within 
the supply chain may result in damaging the 
Company’s reputation and diminishing consumer 
trust, especially with the growing environmental 
awareness and demand for sustainable products.
The Company has formulated 
a Model Responsible Value 
Chain 
Partner 
Code 
of 
Conduct. This covers the 
following aspects: Business 
Ethics; 
Labour 
Practices 
and 
Human 
rights; 
and 
Environment, 
Health 
and Safety. Currently the 
suppliers for the Room Air 
Conditioners, Commercial Air 
Conditioners and Commercial 
Refrigeration 
businesses 
are provided training and 
awareness on aspects related 
to sustainability. The same 
set of suppliers also undergo 
an assessment related to 
sustainability, to understand 
their performance on key 
parameters.

Diversity and 
Inclusion
Opportunity Diversity and inclusion offer an opportunity 
for 
individuals 
from 
diverse 
backgrounds, 
experiences, and perspectives to unite in a 
workforce that embraces inclusivity and equality. 
This brings forth numerous advantages, including 
better decision-making, broader consumer reach, 
an improved employer brand, the advancement

Business 
Ethics
Risk
Failure to adhere to business ethics can 
result in significant risks for a Company. 
If a Company is found to be engaging in 
unethical behaviour, it can damage the 
Company’s reputation and erode public 
trust creating a loss of customers, investors, 
and other stakeholders.
The Company adheres to 
the Tata Code of Conduct 
which serves as a guide 
to each employee and 
entire value chain, on the 
standards of values, ethics, 
and business principles. 
The 
Whistle

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets and

At Voltas, we have always believed in driving business with purpose. Through reporting, we would like to communicate to our 
stakeholders, our progress on Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance performance. Sustainability enables businesses 
to thrive in dynamically changing environments. Innovation and adaptation will be key to overcoming challenges and building 
resilience, especially in the ever-changing environments around us. Some of our key challenges include: reporting on ESG metrics 
for our value chain; adapting to new technologies as well technology availability at a competitive cost especially for our products 
and maneuvering through challenges of transitioning to clean energy.  We have been working in the past year to strengthen 
our commitments towards Sustainability, this includes integrating ESG risks to our Enterprise Risk Management framework; 
building aspirational goals of carbon neutral and water positive for our operations; investing in products and processes that 
are energy efficient; initiating life cycle assessments of some of our products; promoting products and services that help in 
lowering environmental impact; ensuring health and safety of our workforce; partnering with waste recyclers; and supporting 
communities. We believe Sustainability is a journey, and while we believe there is more work to be done, we are also poised to 
take up challenges and improvements through transforming our ways of doing business.

Fast Cooling 
Feature
This concept helps the customer to pull 
down the room temperature to 24°C in 
short span of time. The ambient room 
temperature is brought down by optimising 
the air flow and efficiently distributing the 
temperature to cool the room faster. This 
helps in saving energy and also optimizing 
the cooling of the room.

high reliability, high corrosion resistant and 
zero technician skill (tools) requirement. In 
general, the copper gets corroded due to 
the pollution, and leads to leakages in the 
system. This can lead to Global Warming. But 
due to the Composite material introduction, 
the corrosion is removed increasing the 
reliability of the system and help reducing 
global warming.
