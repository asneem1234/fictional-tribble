strategic investment to procure solar power at subsidized rates through a 
PPA. Though this is an investment in an associate, this has been done as 
an alternative to capital expenditure in Company’s owned solar plants as 
an initiative to renewable energy.
The Company has invested in Chimney Scrubber in one of its plants. This 
will help improve the air quality used through Company’s operations.
