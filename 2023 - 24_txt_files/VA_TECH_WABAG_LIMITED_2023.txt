Introduction:
Embedded in the very DNA of WABAG lies a century-long legacy 
of unwavering commitment to excellence and innovation. As we 
stand on the threshold of our centenary year, this ethos resonates 
more powerfully than ever before. From our inception, we have 
strived to redefine the boundaries of possibility in the realm of water 
and wastewater management. Across every facet of our business 
– from pioneering water treatment technologies to revolutionary 
wastewater management solutions – we have remained 
steadfast in our commitment to environmental sustainability, 
social responsibility, and economic prosperity. As we celebrate 
this milestone, we reflect not only on our past achievements but 
also on the boundless opportunities that lie ahead. Guided by 
our enduring principles and mantra "Sustainable Solutions for 
a Better Life", we continue to lead the industry by embracing 
cutting-edge technologies and sustainable practices, setting new 
standards of excellence with each endeavor. 
Our efforts are intricately woven into the fabric of Sustainable 
Development Goal 6, as we work tirelessly to ensure access to 
clean water and sanitation for all, thereby addressing the critical 
global need for water security in the form of water conservation, 
water recycle and reuse etc. As we continue to expand our focus 
on manufactured water, we are committed to address the growing 
demand for alternative water sources, desalination of water and 
contributing significantly to water sustainability. Additionally, our 
commitment to Sustainable Development Goal 11 drives us to 
create sustainable urban environments, where communities thrive 
in harmony with their surroundings. From desalination plants to 
sewage treatment facilities, our diverse portfolio stands as a 
testament to our relentless pursuit of a better, cleaner world for all. 
As we traverse into our second century, we remain steadfast in our 
resolve to uphold these principles and to continue spearheading 
innovations that pave the way for a Cleaner, Greener, Bluer and 
Better Tomorrow.
"At WABAG, we don't just deliver water, we deliver a 
sustainable future."
Sustainability is WABAG’s Business: 
Transcending mere water treatment solutions, WABAG is guided 
by the vision of "Reshaping the Sector for a Cleaner, Greener, 
Bluer Tomorrow". We relentlessly pursue innovation, measuring its 
success by the positive impact it creates. Our commitment goes 
beyond water delivery - we quantify the tangible results our plants 
achieve, ensuring a measurable difference for a sustainable future.
At WABAG, we recognize the interconnectedness of global 
challenges. Our commitment to sustainability aligns with several 
key Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) established by the 
United Nations:
SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation: WABAG is a global leader 
in pure-play water technology. We offer sustainable solutions 
across four Continents, addressing global water challenges 
through desalination, treatment, and a commitment to resource 
conservation and reuse. From municipalities to industries, WABAG 
provides a comprehensive approach to water management, 
ensuring clean drinking water, minimized pollution, and a thriving 
environment and society. Our innovative treatment solutions 
address water scarcity and improve water quality and reliability, 
promoting healthy life and powering economies worldwide. 
WABAG's expertise extends beyond just municipal and industrial 
water solutions. A prime example is its significant contribution 
to India's Namami Gange Programme, aimed at rejuvenating 
the holy Ganga River. They're not just delivering water treatment 
solutions; they're actively shaping the program's success. By 
designing, constructing, and managing advanced Waste Water 
Treatment Plants (WWTPs) along the Ganga's path from source 
to where it submerges into the sea in West Bengal, WABAG is 
demonstrably reducing untreated wastewater flowing into the 
river, making a vital contribution to a cleaner and healthier Ganga.

SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities: Sustainable 
water management is crucial for building resilient and inclusive 
cities. WABAG's solutions contribute to SDG 11 by fostering water 
security in urban environment, enabling sustainable development 
and improved living conditions.
WABAG champions SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and 
Production through a circular approach to water treatment. 
This approach prioritizes resource efficiency and minimal waste 
generation throughout our operations and water treatment 
processes. Here's how we embrace circularity:
	
Closing the loop: Focus on designing water treatment plants 
that incorporate water recycling and reuse technologies. 
This reduces reliance on virgin water sources and minimizes 
wastewater discharge.
	
Energy Efficiency: We prioritize resource conservation 
throughout the water treatment process. Our innovative 
technologies and design practices minimize energy 
consumption, reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and 
lowering our carbon footprint.
	
Nutrient 
Recovery: 
Wastewater 
treatment 
facilities 
traditionally generate nutrient-rich sludge. WABAG goes 
beyond simply disposing of this sludge. We utilize advanced 
technologies to recover valuable nutrients like phosphorus, 
potassium and nitrogen. These recovered nutrients can then 
be used as fertilizers, creating a closed-loop system and 
minimizing reliance on virgin resources.
	
Biogas Production and Energy Generation: Another 
key aspect of our circular approach is the conversion of 
wastewater treatment plant byproducts into biogas. Through 
anaerobic digestion processes, we capture the methane gas 
produced from organic matter in wastewater. This biogas can 
then be used to generate electricity and compressed Biogas, 
powering our treatment facilities and significantly reducing 
our dependence on the grid. This reduces our operational 
costs and GHG emissions.
By implementing these circularity principles, WABAG 
minimizes waste generation, conserves resources, and 
promotes a more sustainable water treatment cycle. This 
approach aligns perfectly with SDG 12's vision of responsible 
consumption and production and paves the way for a circular 
economy within the water treatment sector.
SDG 13: Climate Action: Climate change poses a significant 
threat to water security. WABAG actively mitigates its 
environmental impact by promoting energy-efficient technologies 
and responsible waste management practices. This focus on 
climate action aligns with SDG 13, ensuring a sustainable future 
for all.
WABAG further aligns its business through SDG 14: Life 
Below Water by reducing water pollution and enhancing 
biodiversity in the Ganga. Additionally, WABAG's work underlines 
the importance of SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals.
  Annual Report 2023-24   |   153
WABAG's Sustainable Solutions extends beyond their projects, WABAG contributes to SDG 14 (Life Below Water) by restoring the 
Ganga's biodiversity. The solutions provided are evident in the documented return of species like Gangetic dolphins, gharials, muggers, 
smooth-coated otters, freshwater turtles, and various water-associated birds. This rich biodiversity indicates the positive impact of 
improved wastewater treatment processes and the release of treated clean water into the river. By reducing pollution levels, these efforts 
have led to a healthier and more vibrant river ecosystem, demonstrating a clear commitment to SDG 14. Some of the pictures from the 
Government’s National Mission for Clean Ganga Annual report 2022-23 are as below: 
Reference: English Annual Report 2022-23.pmd (nmcg.nic.in)
Leading the Way in Sustainable Water Solutions: WABAG is 
a frontrunner in Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) 
practices, aligning with the rigorous international standards 
set by prominent financial institutions like the World Bank, IFC 
and ADB. This unwavering commitment reflects our dedication 
to sustainable development and positions us as a responsible 
steward of environmental and social resources.
Rigorous Compliance for Sustainable Outcomes: We adhere 
to the highest ESG standards, providing a comprehensive 
framework for managing environmental risks, enhancing social 
accountability, and safeguarding community well-being. These 
standards promote sustainable environmental management 
and conservation. Through a meticulous compliance process, 
we identify, assess, and mitigate potential environmental and 
social impacts associated with our projects. This location-
specific approach ensures compliance with applicable laws while 
protecting ecosystems, biodiversity, and communities. We are 
proactive in developing mitigation plans to address any potential 
negative impacts.
Commitment in Action: Our dedication to ESG translates into 
a robust suite of processes and procedures implemented during 
project execution. These include the Environment, Social, and 
Governance Management Plan (ESGMP), Risk Management 
Plan (RMP), Waste Management Plan (WMP), Occupational 
Health and Safety Plan (OHSP), and Social Management 
and Monitoring Plan (SMMoP). Additionally, we have Disaster 
Management Plans (DMP), Grievance Redressal Mechanisms 
Plan (GRMP), Stakeholder Engagement Plans (SEMP), Gender 
Action Plans (GAP), all implemented during projects like the 
STPs for KMDA/NMCG in Kolkata under the HAM model. These 
procedures provide clear guidance for our project teams, ensuring 
environmentally and socially responsible project execution.
Innovation and Sustainability Remain at the Core: Innovation 
has always been the cornerstone of WABAG's success. We 
continue to invest in research and development, exploring new 
technologies and solutions to address the ever-evolving water 
challenges. This commitment extends to sustainability practices. 
We constantly focus on sustainability and promote responsible 
water management across all our projects.

based on modern MBR technology. It is the city of Windhoek's first 
BOOT project in the water field, with 21 years of O&M (spanning 
from 2014 to 2035), and represents an exemplary cooperation in a 
public-private partnership.
WABAG is at the forefront of innovation, exemplified by our 
strategic MoU with Peak Sustainability Ventures for installing 100 
Bio-CNG Plants in future. This initiative not only will address the 
growing energy demand sustainably but also reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions and mitigates air pollution. Furthermore, it will 
bolster local economies, create jobs, and align with the G20 
Summit’s Global Biofuel Alliance initiative, enhancing energy 
security.
Applied AI for Treatment Plants: WABAG has partnered with 
Pani Energy Inc.'s (Pani) to implement applied AI for treatment 
plants. The new category of digital technology is called Operational 
Intelligence (OI) and delivered through their product Pani ZEDTM, 
in the plant operations. The partnership aims to leverage Pani's 
platform to optimize on OPEX in the plants by reducing downtime, 
energy consumption, and chemical usage. Additionally, it will 
expedite crucial decision-making processes and enhance the 
longevity of critical equipment. Pani ZEDTM's capability to provide 
continuous performance analytics, process forecasting, detect 
operational anomalies, offer actionable insights, and set-point 
recommendations.
WABAG is strategically focusing on two emerging sectors poised

approach demonstrates WABAG's 
leadership in adopting renewable energy 
solutions, ultimately contributing to a 
more sustainable water management 
future. WABAG designs its plants for its

corporate culture, each of the trainees is assigned a Mentor preferably from the same discipline. The purpose of this is to provide 
Mentees with necessary inputs in handling work criticalities, making choices on departments and to track progress of their 
learning syllabus. Each trainee of different discipline has been entrusted with a set of learning syllabus. These Mentor Mentees 
ought to meet every fortnight to review the Mentee’s learnings at the workplace. When there is a lag in the learnability at the 
incumbent role, the Mentor will be able to guide the Mentee to take up a job rotation inside the organization for betterment. On 
frequent intervals, the feedback will be collected from both “Mentors on Mentees” and “Mentees on their respective Mentors”. In 
case of any grievances, HR would reallocate a new Mentor.

Safety plays a paramount role in WABAG's business. In the workplace, we ensure safety through various systems and procedures 
across all our EPC and O&M sites. We conduct safety induction training for all individuals entering the site premises. The 
implementation of the JSA system provides knowledge about potential risks and ways to mitigate them. Our Hazard Identification 
and Risk Assessment (HIRA) process helps identify and assess hazards and risks in our activities.
We have an effective Work Permit system in place, ensuring that supervisors are informed of work activities, and necessary safety 
measures are taken into account before commencing the job. Prior to initiating any job, we conduct Tool Box Talks, briefing on the 
activities to be carried out and describing possible risks, along with ways to overcome them.

workplace, we offer necessary beverages during the summer and adjust work hours to mitigate heat stress.
We believe in recognizing and rewarding those who demonstrate exemplary commitment to safety. Through our awards and 
recognition programs, we celebrate individuals and teams who go above and beyond to uphold our safety standards. By shining a 
spotlight on their dedication, we not only acknowledge their contributions but also inspire others to emulate their behavior. Company 
tracks millions of safe manhours of work without any LTI and publishes and recognizes in town hall or Management Review meetings.

safety officers serve as the grievance mechanism executives. Site team members have access to register their complaints in the 
grievance register, which are then directly addressed by the Project Manager for resolution. With an effective grievance redressal 
system, we ensure a safe and secure workplace.

Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan? Give details in 100 words/ web link.
Yes, we have the Business Continuity Plan and the same is available in Company’s Intranet. Business continuity can play an essential 
role in ESG by ensuring that companies are well-prepared to address environmental, social, and governance risks and disruptions 
while maintaining their operations and responsibilities to stakeholders. According to ISO 22301, business continuity plan is defined 
  Annual Report 2023-24   |   197
as “documented procedures that guide organizations to respond, recover, resume, and restore to a pre-defined level of operation 
following disruption”. A disaster recovery plan (DR or DRP) is a formal document created by an organization that contains detailed 
instructions on how to respond to unplanned incidents such as natural disasters, power outages, cyber-attacks and any other 
disruptive events. While sustainability focuses on the broader concept of maintaining valued attributes and adapting to change, 
continuity specifically relates to the uninterrupted continuation of specific activities or operations.
In WABAG, we have Business Continuity Plan to address the Environmental, Social and Governance risks / disruptions as an 
organization. We also have site specific Disaster management plan to effectively prepare for and respond to disasters.
Following testifies effectiveness of our DRP policy for IT. WABAG is in the business of pollution abatement and its primary business 
objective is to build plants to treat water/waste water and also operate and maintain the said plants & meeting the KPIs agreed with 
our clientele. While talking about disaster recovery, we want to mention here that WABAG was able to operate hundreds of plants 
across globe, during lock-down both in India as well as in other countries due to COVID19 impact on all the countries across globe. 
WABAG was able to ensure uninterrupted supply of drinking water and treatment of sewage / effluent in all its plants, thus fulfilling 
our commitment of protecting environment even during a disaster/Pandemic like COVID19. Our world-class IT systems enabled 
borderless remote digital workplace during lock-down which ensured business as usual. Workplace hygiene, continuous awareness 
[standard operating procedure (SOP)], vaccination drives are facilitated for our direct and indirect employees to ensure workplace 
safety. At WABAG’s construction as well as O&M sites, employees were provided with well sanitized accommodations, safety 
measures and all essentials within the project premises to restrict the movement and to avoid the risk of infection.
WABAG is celebrating its 100 years of existence as a Brand and it has been growing over the period of years. This testifies the 
efficacy of its business continuity.
With the digital enablement, business objectives of many weeks of trips were achieved in a few hours of digital interactions among 
the employees and the customers.
