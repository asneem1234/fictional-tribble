GHG Emissions
Risk
Entities in the Agricultural 
Products industry generate 
direct 
greenhouse 
gas 
(GHG) 
emissions 
from 
processing 
and 
transporting goods. In case 
of the Company, Sugar & 
Methane 
manufacturing 
emits considerable amount 
of GHG. Stringent emission 
control 
regulations 
may 
increase the cost of capital, 
operational costs and affect 
the operational efficiency 
of the Company without 
strategies to manage GHG 
emissions. 
Employing innovative technologies 
that use alternative fuels and 
energy inputs—including biomass 
waste generated from internal 
processes—and 
improving 
fuel 
efficiency are ways the Company 
strives to limit its GHG emissions. 
The Company is addressing these 
challenges 
through 
innovation 
and sustainability. The Company is 
generating considerable amount 
of solar energy at its different sites, 
significantly reducing grid energy 
emissions. Further, the Company 
has taken green belt initiatives 
resulting in plantation of more 
than 4 lakh trees across multiple 
locations, enhancing biodiversity, 
preventing soil erosion, and carbon 
sequestration. Furthermore, the 
Company is transitioning to low 
Global Warming Potential (GWP) 
gas R-32 for refrigeration and 
using LPG for Granulated Activated 
Carbon (GAC) generation at some 
sites, thereby further reducing its 
adverse environmental impact.

Product Quality 
& Risk Safety 
Risk
Product 
quality 
of 
the 
Company is dependent on 
aspects like temperature, 
humidity, 
light, 
and 
weather. 
Maintaining 
product safety & quality is 
directly linked to customer 
satisfaction, 
regulatory 
adherence, brand integrity 
& competitive positioning 
in the market. Poor farming, 
transport, 
storage 
or 
handling 
practices 
can 
further impact the quality 
of the product. Food quality 
and safety issues can result 
in changes in demand and 
regulatory action. Product 
recalls 
can 
harm 
brand 
reputation, reduce revenues 
and involve costly fines. 
To address or minimize risks related 
to product quality and safety, the 
Company has established a strong 
quality management system. It 
endeavors to adhere to applicable 
regulations and strives to maintain 
product quality through various 
practices such as: conducting 
thorough product testing and 
inspection, 
ensuring 
supplier 
quality, 
continuous 
monitoring 
and audit processes, conducting 
risk 
assessments, 
providing 
comprehensive 
employee 
trainings, 
maintaining 
open 
communication 
& 
establishing 
efficient recall procedures. By 
implementing 
these 
measures, 
the Company aims to safeguard 
customer satisfaction, preserve 
brand 
reputation 
and 
bolster 
business resilience.

Energy 
Management
Risk
Business 
operations 
of 
the 
Company 
requires 
substantial energy input. 
Use 
of 
fossil 
fuels 
for 
generation 
of 
power 
& 
obtaining 
power 
from 
electrical 
grid- 
both 
contributes 
to 
environmental 
impacts, 
including climate change 
and 
pollution. 
Energy 
management 
affects 
current and future costs 
of 
operation. 
Climate 
regulation 
and 
other 
sustainability factors could 
result in higher or more 
volatile electricity and fuel 
prices, increasing operating 
costs for the Company. 
To address energy management 
risks effectively, the Company 
looks 
forward 
to 
adopting 
measures such as conducting an 
energy audit, establishing energy 
reduction objectives & investing in 
energy-efficient technologies. The 
Company continues to explore 
renewable 
energy 
alternatives 
for 
replacing 
the 
traditional 
ways of energy generation. The 
Company continues to explore 
implementation 
of 
energy 
monitoring 
and 
automation 
systems and consistently refine 
energy strategies. These actions 
aim at improving energy efficiency, 
lower the expenses and further 
Company’s 
environmental 
sustainability objectives.

Water & 
Waste water 
Management
Risk
The 
Company’s 
reliance 
on water for processing 
activities, and generation 
of wastewater or effluent 
creates 
environmental 
footprint; 
however 
by 
effective 
adoption 
of 
Zero 
Liquid 
Discharge 
mechanism 
and 
setting 
of 
Sewage 
Treatment 
Plant & Effluent Treatment 
Plant – it aims to reduce 
the adverse environmental 
footprint on water usage. 
Reuse of water & Rainwater 
harvesting initiatives gives 
an edge to the Company 
in 
terms 
of 
effective 
water management in its 
sustainability journey.

Employee Health 
Risk & Safety 
Risk
Employees may be engaged 
in labor-intensive activities 
involving common hazards 
such as falls, transportation 
accidents, 
equipment-
related 
accidents, 
and 
heat-related illness or injury, 
among others. Violations of 
health and safety standards 
could result in regulatory 
penalties 
and 
costs 
for 
corrective actions. 
To address and mitigate risks 
associated 
with 
employee 
health and safety, the Company 
undertakes risk assessments, offer 
safety trainings and protocols, 
ensure correct usage of Personal 
Protective 
Equipment 
(PPE), 
implement 
hazard 
controls, 
promote 
health 
and 
wellness 
programs 
& 
monitor 
safety 
performance 
and 
involve 
employees in safety initiatives. 
These measures help the Company 
to build brand image and promote 
worker morale, which results in 
increased productivity, reduced 
worker turnover and enhanced 
community relations.

Statement by Director responsible for the Business Responsibility Report, highlighting ESG related challenges, 
targets and achievements
	
The move towards more sustainable living is driving new trends across all industries, including ours. 
Nowadays, the diversity of products, incorporating innovation compels producers to constantly enhance 
quality while reducing their carbon footprint. Beyond financial considerations, the non-monetary aspects of 
sustainability are crucial for holistic business growth. This underscores the importance of formally recognizing 
best practices within the realms of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) standards.
	
Our Company operates with a commitment to Zero Liquid Discharge. Additionally, we generate most of 
our operational energy from bagasse, ensuring minimal carbon emissions. As a major ethanol supplier to 
Oil Marketing Companies, we contribute significantly to the nation’s efforts to lower its carbon footprint. 
Moreover, we engage in large-scale tree plantation and collaborate with farmers on efficient cultivation 
techniques, such as drip irrigation for sugarcane, efficient waste management in the form of biogas/bio 
digesters and trash mulching initiatives. In the upcoming years, we plan to intensify our sustainability efforts 
by making our processes more energy-efficient and discovering new ways to further reduce our carbon 
footprint.

The Company’s wastewater treatment mechanism is comprehensive, involving multiple stages across various 
units to ensure effective treatment and reuse of 
water. Initially, acid and alkaline water from the 
Water Treatment Plant (WTP) are neutralized in a 
tank and utilized for ash quenching. The effluent from 
the sugar mill’s cooling tower, including wastewater 
from the boiling house, is directed to the Effluent 
Treatment Plant (ETP), where it undergoes a 
series of treatments. The process begins with an 
anaerobic digester, reducing approximately 50-
65% of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) and 
Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD). This is followed 
by aerobic treatment in an activated sludge process 
with extended aeration, which further lowers COD

and BOD levels. The treated water is then passed through tertiary units like Multi-Grade Filters (MGF) and 
Activated Carbon Filters (ACF) to remove suspended solids, ensuring compliance with state pollution control 
board norms. The final treated water is used for greenbelt development within the factory premises and 
irrigating the colony’s gardens, or provided to local farmers. Additionally, an 80 cubic meters per day Sewage 
Treatment Plant (STP) is being installed to handle sewage from the colony, further enhancing water recycling 
efforts. In Ajinkyatara and Kandla units, a Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) system is implemented, where treated 
water is fully reused within the process, including in sugar cooling towers and for recovery boiling purposes, 
making the process environmentally sustainable.

10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy 
adopted by your Company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and 
processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes
	
The Company’s waste management strategies involve a multi-faceted approach to handling hazardous 
materials. Used oil, is being efficiently reused as a lubricant in various equipment, including bagasse elevators, 
RBCs, MBCs, godown shutters, and cane bullock carts. Additionally, waste oil residues are burned in the 
Company’s boilers along with bagasse fuel, contributing to energy generation. Hazardous wastes such as 
empty barrels, spent oil, and oil residues are sent to authorized recyclers, ensuring that these materials 
are either recycled or properly disposed of. The Company meticulously tracks the disposal process by 
generating necessary documentation, to comply with regulatory requirements. This integrated approach 
not only minimizes environmental impact but also aligns with sustainable practices by recycling and reusing 
materials wherever possible.

Using ETP to treat water 
and provide excess for 
irrigation
The ETP receives cooling tower 
blowdown from the boiling house 
via pumps into an Equalization 
tank. From there, the effluent 
goes to an Anaerobic Digester 
for initial biological treatment, 
achieving a 50% reduction in 
COD and BOD. Following this, the 
effluent undergoes aeration for 
further treatment. Subsequently, 
the treated water passes through 
a Multigrade Filter (MGF) and an 
Activated Carbon Filter (ACF) to 
remove suspended solids. The 
final treated water meets Pollution 
Control Board norms and is stored 
in GLSR 3&4, with excess water 
being disposed of for irrigation

Planted tree species will promote 
biodiversity and support the local 
ecosystem rebuilding by preventing 
soil erosion and land degradation. The 
trees would absorb carbon dioxide 
from the atmosphere, aiding in 
mitigating climate change. The green 
spaces will provide opportunities for 
recreation, relaxation, and aesthetic 
enjoyment, improving overall quality 
of life of locals.

Use of STP to improve 
the water quality of 
discharge
An STP installation with a capacity 
of 80 cubic meters per day is 
currently being set up to treat 
sewage from the colony. The 
treated water will be utilized for 
maintaining the colony garden.
The use of treated water will minimize 
the discharge of wastewater into 
natural water bodies, preventing 
pollution thereby, the demand on 
freshwater resources, contributing to 
environmental sustainability.

Use 
of 
R32 
as 
a 
Refrigerant  gas 
The gradual use of R-32 in the 
refrigeration units on most of 
the plants shows our efforts in 
replacing traditional gases with 
high GWP.
R- 32 having a lower GWP than 
traditional gases lowers the total 
emissions 
lowering 
the 
risk 
of 
warming the planet. Thus, aligning 
with the global temperature reduction 
agenda.
