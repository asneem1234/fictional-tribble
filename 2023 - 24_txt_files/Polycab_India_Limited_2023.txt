What is the contribution of exports as a percentage of the total turnover of the entity?
	
During the year 2023-24, the Company’s export business stood at I17,485 million, contributing to 10% of the 
overall revenue. The Company continued to be one of the largest exporters of cables in India, exporting to 79 
countries across the globe. Demand in the Americas, Australia, and Middle East regions gave the maximum 
traction to sales. The global thrust on renewable energy has played an important role in our growing export

cables for power transmission. Through Project Leap, we prioritised new product development, market expansion

Statement by director responsible 
for the business responsibility 
report, highlighting ESG 
related challenges, targets and 
achievements (listed entity has 
flexibility regarding the placement 
of this disclosure)
Polycab’s commitment to sustainability is deeply rooted in our mission to promote sustainable living. Our products are designed to meet our 
customers’ evolving needs whilst minimising our environmental footprint. We firmly believe that sustainability is not just ethical but also essential 
for long-term success. Over recent decades, significant changes have occurred in the natural ecosystem, atmosphere, communities, governments, 
and businesses, necessitating immediate climate action. As a conscientious entity, we are resolutely dedicated to contributing to this imperative 
cause through our proactive measures.
Our sustainability strategy serves as a roadmap, guiding us in integrating sustainability across our operations which is essential for building resilience 
in the business, transforming culture and for long-term value creation of all our stakeholders. To actualise this vision, we have outlined a series of time-
bound internal goals spanning key areas like environmental conservation, waste reduction, Water management, equity, diversity, and inclusion. These 
goals rest on three foundational pillars: ensuring planetary health, enhancing human well-being, and fostering a more inclusive and equitable society. 
Along with that various initiatives have been taken in the past year to reduce our GHG emissions and overall environmental impact.
We have strategically enhanced our commitment by launching comprehensive ESG awareness programs, revamping policies and procedures, 
propagating principles of ESG, focusing on human rights, formalising grievance redressal systems and promoting safe and fair working conditions. 
These initiatives are designed to educate and engage our value chain partners on the importance of sustainable practices and the role they play 
in promoting environmental stewardship, social responsibility, and ethical governance. Additionally, we have implemented rigorous health and 
safety protocols alongside human rights assessments across our value chain. We have also begun health, safety, and environmental checks for our 
partners. We now include a review of their sustainability efforts when they engage with us. We regularly communicate with our partners through 
surveys to understand their priority areas and align the same with ours.
This approach not only helps in identifying and mitigating potential risks but also ensures that our partners adhere to our high standards of 
operational excellence and ethical compliance. These measures are integral to our ongoing efforts to foster a responsible and sustainable business 
ecosystem that aligns with our core values and enhances our long-term corporate reputation and profitability.

Plants
1.	
Plans are chalked out and being executed for effluent recycling plants to reuse the industrial 
waste-water. These plants aim to recycle industrial wastewater, allowing for its reuse rather than 
discharging it into the environment.
2.	
Achieving approximately 80% recovery of industrial wastewater implies a significant reduction 
in water extraction from natural resources. This not only conserves water but also minimises 
pollution of water bodies.
3.	
By recycling wastewater, industries can reduce their reliance on freshwater sources by 
about 20-25%, which is a substantial conservation effort.

environmental laws and regulations.
	
The Company conducts internal evaluations of its suppliers based on their environmental impact, social 
responsibility, and corporate governance practices, including factors such as carbon footprint, labour standards, 
diversity and inclusion policies, and ethical business conduct. During the current financial year, the Company 
conducted evaluation of over 80% of our input material suppliers (in value), which are reputable international 
companies, based on their publicly available sustainability reports. The majority of our suppliers are well known 
for their commitment to sustainability and have mature ESG practices.

Polycab India Limited established the Polycab Social Welfare Foundation (PSWF) in 2020 as a not-for-profit 
organisation dedicated to community development and fulfilling CSR commitments. PSWF addresses various 
social causes, including malnutrition, healthcare, education, women’s empowerment, environment, skill 
development, disaster management, agriculture, animal husbandry, sanitation, national heritage, and culture. 
PSWF also partners with non-governmental organisations (NGOs) that visit communities, interact with the 
people, to address grievances and supports Polycab to create a positive impact amongst the local communities. 
CSR governance at Polycab employs a two-tier system, where the CSR and ESG committee recommends 
and monitors the CSR Annual Action Plan which is subject to annual approval and review by the Board of 
Directors. Effective mechanisms, including a dedicated email address (cs@polycab.com), are in place to address 
community queries and redress grievances concerning CSR projects, programs, and activities.
	
PSWF adopts a community-centric approach, placing community needs and priorities at the forefront of 
its interventions. Regular interactions between our CSR teams and implementing partners facilitate the 
identification and resolution of community issues, complaints, and grievances related to our interventions. PSWF 
has formalised the process of documenting these interactions to comply with BRSR, ensuring timely resolution 
of grievances. Notably, no grievances concerning program commitments were recorded; instead, requests 
for expanding existing programs predominated. Our CSR teams have duly acknowledged these concerns 
and incorporated relevant actions into plans for the upcoming year. During 2023-24, 66 such community 
engagements were held across all major states where CSR programmes are implemented.
