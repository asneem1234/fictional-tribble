chain. This ensures that all 
our partners and suppliers 
operate in alignment with 
our company's cornerstones,

Occupational 
Health and 
Safety
Risk
Occupational health and safety risks in retail 
encompass potential accidents, injuries for 
employees. Failure to address these risks can 
result in worker injuries, increased workers' 
compensation claims, legal liabilities.
Our commitment to employee 
safety is paramount. We conduct 
regular internal audits to stay 
ahead of potential occupational 
risks. These in-depth assessments 
allow us to identify and address 
the most critical hazards within 
our operations before they can 
impact our workforce. This 
proactive approach has proven 
successful in minimising the 
occurrence of work-related 
injuries and illnesses. By 
prioritising regular internal 
audits, we continuously 
improve workplace safety and 
demonstrate our dedication to 
employee well-being.

Data 
Management 
and Cyber 
Security
Risk
The handling of vast customer data, including 
sensitive personal and payment information, 
means that any data breach could have 
severe consequences, including financial loss, 
legal penalties, and damage to reputation. 
Furthermore, failure to uphold privacy 
standards can erode customer trust, leading 
to potential loss of business and affecting the 
Company's long-term viability.
Our approach to privacy 
protection and data security 
is multi-faceted. We've 
implemented a robust IT policy 
that covers all phases of the data 
lifecycle, including acquisition, 
use, storage, and disposal. This 
ensures data protection at each 
level. Our 'Defence in Depth' 
strategy adds multiple layers of 
security measures, creating a 
more robust protection system. 
We place great emphasis on 
personnel and customer data 
security, training employees about 
safe data handling practices and 
employing advanced encryption 
for customer data. Additionally, 
we comply with all local and 
international data privacy laws 
and regulations to maintain the 
highest level of data security.

Statement by Director responsible for the Business Responsibility Report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets 
and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of  this disclosure)
	
As the director responsible for the Business Responsibility Report, I am proud to present our progress in addressing Environmental, 
Social, and Governance (ESG) issues. This year marks the completion of our inaugural Business Responsibility and Sustainability 
Report (BRSR), a significant milestone that included conducting a materiality assessment, identifying key stakeholders, and 
calculating our greenhouse gas emissions, water, and energy footprint.
	
We have made substantial progress in tackling challenges such as privacy and data security, corporate governance, business ethics, 
and compliance. Our focus also extends to opportunities in supply chain management, community development, and customer 
satisfaction, and we are making consistent efforts in these areas.
	
To reduce our environmental impact, we have set concrete targets. We have partnered with the Edge Group to install solar panels 
with smart switches across our offices and retail outlets, significantly increasing our use of renewable energy. Additionally, we are 
actively working to reduce water consumption and single-use plastics. For example, we have installed Reverse Osmosis systems 
in our outlets to decrease reliance on bottled water.
	
Furthermore, we are committed to offsetting our carbon footprint through a green belt initiative, which will not only beautify our 
surroundings but also mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. Our achievements in this journey are noteworthy. We have established 
an ESG committee to oversee and strategise our sustainability initiatives and successfully installed solar power plants at several 
outlets.
	
In conclusion, these accomplishments are stepping stones in our commitment to ESG targets. We understand that the road 
ahead is long, but we remain dedicated to making a positive impact.

We prioritise responsible sourcing and social responsibility. To ensure our value chain partners comply with statutory dues, we take a 
multi-pronged approach.
	
First, we carefully assess potential vendors during selection, evaluating their compliance history with regulations like ESIC and EPF. 
Our contracts explicitly state the obligation of our partners to adhere to all statutory requirements.
	
Furthermore, we conduct regular monitoring. This includes requesting copies of challans (payment receipts) for deductions like 
ESIC and Provident Fund. We typically cross-check these challans with the previous month’s attendance register to verify accuracy. 
In some cases, on-site visits may be conducted to confirm documentation and adherence to labor laws.
	
A defined escalation process exists for identified discrepancies. This may involve requesting corrective actions, withholding 
payments, or even terminating partnerships in cases of persistent non-compliance.
	
Through these measures, we aim to promote responsible practices within our network and uphold our commitment to ethical 
sourcing.

At EMIL, we’ve engaged in a collaborative effort led by top management and supported by board members and various departments 
to identify our key stakeholders. These stakeholders, both internal and external, are integral to our organisation, encompassing 
employees, investors, shareholders, government bodies, suppliers, customers, financial institutions, and the wider community.
	
We recognise and highly value the diverse contributions of each stakeholder group towards achieving our strategic objectives. 
Their perspectives are not just acknowledged but esteemed, as we strive to build and nurture robust relationships with them. 
Through continuous dialogue and meaningful engagement, we are committed to understanding and meeting the evolving needs 
and aspirations of all our stakeholders, ensuring that their voices are heard and respected at every step of our journey.
(This principle highlights the importance of stakeholder engagement. Companies should consider the interests and perspectives of all 
stakeholders, including shareholders, employees, customers, suppliers, and the communities in which they operate. They should also be responsive 
to stakeholder concerns and feedback.)

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? 
	
Yes
	
We are actively engaged in a project aimed at reducing our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. A key component of our initiative 
involves the replacement of traditional, energy-intensive lighting systems with highly efficient LED lights. This transition has 
successfully reduced our energy consumption, thereby lowering our carbon footprint and decreasing emissions. Our commitment 
to energy conservation reflects our dedication to minimising environmental impact and mitigating GHG emissions.
	
In addition to these efforts, we have installed solar panels at our outlets to further diminish our reliance on non-renewable energy 
sources. This initiative not only reduces the fuel consumption of our diesel generators but also strengthens our commitment to 
renewable energy. Furthermore, the implementation of smart meters has enabled us to gain comprehensive insights into our 
electricity consumption, enhancing our ability to manage energy effectively.
	
Moreover, through a strategic partnership with the Edge Group, we are expanding our use of renewable energy by installing 
additional solar panels at our outlets. This initiative represents a significant step forward in our ongoing commitment to 
adopting green energy solutions and reducing our overall environmental impact.

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your 
company to reduce usage of  hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted 
to manage such wastes.
	
At our establishment, we have implemented robust waste management practices to effectively handle the waste generated at our 
offices and shops. Our meticulous approach begins with careful segregation of waste into categories such as recyclables, organic 
waste, and non-recyclables. This ensures that each type of waste is appropriately managed. Subsequently, the segregated waste 
is responsibly transferred to certified vendors and municipal authorities who specialise in environmentally friendly disposal 
methods. These practices not only minimise our environmental footprint but also uphold our commitment to promoting 
sustainable waste management practices.

Installation of 
rooftop solar 
panels
We have begun the process of installing 
solar panels at several of our retail outlets. 
The solar panels installed enabling us to 
significantly offset our energy consumption 
with clean, renewable energy.
This eco-friendly initiative is set to drastically reduce 
our energy consumption from non-renewable 
sources. In addition to decreasing our reliance on 
traditional electricity, the use of solar panels will also 
result in a significant reduction in the fuel consumed 
by our diesel generator sets.
-
Installation 
of RO 
Plants 
We have installed Reverse Osmosis (RO) 
systems at our retail outlets. This initiative 
is designed to substantially decrease our 
reliance on bottled water. The use of RO 
systems ensures the availability of safe, 
purified water at our locations, thereby 
reducing the need for bottled water 
consumption.
The implementation of Reverse Osmosis (RO) 
systems at our retail outlets, a measure set to 
significantly reduce waste generated from disposable 
plastic bottles. This decision directly supports 
our commitment to sustainability, as it drastically 
decreases the volume of plastic waste entering our 
ecosystems. Furthermore, by curtailing the need for 
bottled water, we will indirectly reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions associated with the transportation of 
these products.
