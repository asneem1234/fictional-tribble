Please indicate material responsible business conduct and sustainability issues pertaining to environmental and 
social matters that present a risk or an opportunity to your business, rationale for identifying the same, approach 
to adapt or mitigate the risk along-with its financial implications, as per the following format:

1.
Carbon 
Emissions and 
Climate Change
Risk and 
Opportunity
Climate Change poses 
acute and chronic physical 
risks to our operations and 
value chain. Climate change 
also poses transition risks 
to our business, which 
include technological 
advances in products and 
evolving market and policy 
landscape changes.
TML is cognizant of the 
physical and transition risks 
posed by climate change 
in the short, medium and 
long term. We have set 
ourselves ambitious targets 
of achieving Net Zero GHG 
emissions by 2045 in CV 
business and 2040 in the 
PV business. We have set 
intermediate targets of 
achieving RE100 before the 
end of this decade and are 
committed to set interim 
Science Based Targets.
Our roadmap, at the 
operations level and 
product level are fully 
aligned to our ambition and 
our intermediate targets.
An increase in the 
frequency of extreme 
weather events like storms, 
floods, heatwaves could 
have significant direct 
and indirect impact on 
our supply chain and our 
operations, thus adversely 
affecting our ability to 
fulfil demand.
Evolving customer choices 
may lead to increased 
demand for low-carbon 
vehicles. Policy direction 
may require us to adopt 
low carbon manufacturing. 
Carbon pricing mandates 
may potentially enhance 
transition risk.

2.
Environmental 
regulations 
and compliance
Risk
We are subject to a rapidly 
evolving regulatory 
landscape with associated 
laws, regulations and 
policies that impact our 
facilities and vehicles. 
The transition away from 
traditional fossil fuels to 
renewable energy sources  
and the increasing pace 
of that transition creates 
compliance challenges. 
Notable to mention here 
are tailpipe emissions for 
automotive companies 
and wider compliance 
requirements for carbon 
emissions produced 
during manufacturing and 
other operations.
TML is ahead of the curve 
in meeting environment 
regulations and 
compliance as we view 
every regulatory norm 
change as an opportunity 
to add significant value 
to our products while 
meeting our stakeholder’s 
aspirations. e.g. In the BS4 
to BS6 transition, we have 
capitalised by refreshing 
our entire portfolio with 
significant product upgrades 
that add immense value 
throughout the product 
life-cycle.
We may incur additional 
compliance costs to avoid 
facing significant civil and 
regulatory penalties and 
our competitors may gain 
an advantage by adopting 
new emissions-reducing and 
fuel-efficient technologies 
before we do. Furthermore, 
we may incur significant 
reputational damage, which 
could materially impact 
our brands and sales, if we 
fail to meet environmental 
compliances. Regulatory 
and governmental policy 
changes may introduce 
additional operational costs 
in the form of carbon pricing 
and taxation.
3.
Supply Chain 
Sustainability
Risk and 
Opportunity
Consumers are increasingly 
interested in the 
sustainability of products 
they purchase, including the 
environmental and social 
impacts of the entire supply 
chain. Non-compliance 
of the supply chain with 
environmental, labour 
and ethical standards 
can lead to reputational 
damage, legal liabilities and 
operational disruptions.
We are dedicated to leading 
the way in Sustainable 
Mobility, with a focus on 
our supply chain. Initiatives 
like the ‘Sustainable 
Supply Chain Initiative’ 
(launched in 2017) and 
‘AIKYAM’ a collaborative 
platform (introduced in 
2023) underscore this 
commitment. We have 
established a robust 
framework including a 
Supplier Code of Conduct, 
Environmental Procurement 
Policy and Sustainability 
Guidelines covering 
governance, compliance, 
transparency, safety and 
human rights. Oversight 
mechanisms, led by the 
Executive Committee and 
Chief Purchasing Officer, 
ensure effective execution. 
Continuous review of 
procurement practices 
maintains alignment with 
sustainability goals.
Dependence on 
unsustainable suppliers may 
disrupt operations and harm 
product quality. Conversely, 
investing in a sustainable 
supply chain can yield long-
term cost savings, enhance 
brand value and meet 
stakeholder expectations.

4.
IT and Cyber 
Security
Risk
We are exposed to IT 
risks since IT plays an 
important role in our 
operations, including the 
manufacturing, design of 
engineering processes. 
With our vehicles becoming 
increasingly technologically 
advanced and connected 
to the internet, they may 
become more susceptible to 
unauthorised access. We are 
also subject to risks related 
to legacy IT systems and 
system migration projects.
Information risk and cyber 
security are managed 
strategically. Through a 
cohesive programme of 
initiatives, we mitigate 
significant business risks 
while positively influencing 
business and brand value, 
growth, stability and overall 
success. We continue 
to drive measurable 
improvements in cyber 
defense and other core 
security capabilities 
(e.g., security ecosystem, 
supply chain security, risk 
governance and cultural 
change).
Successful cyber-attacks 
could cause significant 
business disruption, 
affecting our ability to 
deliver products and 
services to our customers. 
In extreme situations, this 
could affect the personal 
safety of our customers and 
colleagues. Regulatory and 
statutory requirements are 
increasing and failure to 
meet these obligations, such 
as the statutes of privacy 
and data protection law, 
could result in enforcement 
action, fines, reputational 
and financial damage. 
Any IT system migration, 
if not carried out within 
defined timelines or if 
implementation and 
outcome are not as desired, 
could materially adversely 
affect our operations, affect 
financial performance and 
cause reputation damage.
5.
Circularity
Opportunity
Circular business models 
enable creation of economic 
value at every stage of 
a product’s lifecycle by 
ensuring products retain 
their original identity and
function. Circular business 
models allow higher 
utilization, incentivize more 
reliable & durable products 
while enabling reuse and 
refurbishment of products 
and components even as 
they are designed.
TML has built a circular 
economy framework 
“Tatva”, signifying our 
commitment to embedding 
circular economy 
principles across our 
entire organization. Tatva 
represents the essence 
of integrating circularity 
into every aspect of our 
business, aiming to reduce 
virgin material consumption, 
lower our material carbon 
footprint, extend life of our 
products & parts, as well 
as improving utilization of 
our products.
Designing for circularity 
is a key component of the 
Circular Economy. 
Maximum value is drawn 
when all the circular 
business models of 
Servitization, Longer 
durable life and Reuse are 
deployed in conjunction 
ensuring recurring revenues 
throughout the lifecycle.

TML is committed to a significant shift, aiming to position itself as a frontrunner in Sustainable Mobility. Recognizing the 
pivotal role of the supply chain in this transition, TML launched the ‘Sustainable Supply Chain Initiative’ back in 2017 and a 
collaborative platform called ‘AIKYAM’ in 2023.
	
Within this endeavor, we’ve established a comprehensive framework comprising a Supplier Code of Conduct, an 
Environmental Procurement Policy and Sustainability Guidelines for Suppliers. These guidelines encompass critical aspects 
such as governance, legal compliance, management system certification, transparency and reporting, occupational health 
and safety, labour, rights and human rights. Our objective in setting these standards is to nurture responsible practices 
among our suppliers and partners alike.
	
In tandem with these foundational guidelines, we’ve instituted robust oversight mechanisms to ensure the effective 
execution of our supplier ESG program. Oversight responsibility is clearly defined, with the highest decision-making body, 
the Executive Committee Members, along with the Chief Purchasing Officer, tasked with monitoring and guiding this 
pivotal aspect of our sustainability journey.
	
Moreover, our procurement practices undergo continuous review to maintain alignment with the Supplier Code of Conduct 
and prevent any potential conflicts with our ESG requirements. This ongoing scrutiny ensures that every aspect of our 
procurement process resonates with our sustainability objectives.
	
In addition to these efforts, we actively evaluate our suppliers against minimum ESG requirements. Through rigorous 
assessments, we gauge their adherence to sustainability standards, thereby gaining valuable insights into their environmental 
and social performance. Recognizing the indispensable role of internal stakeholders, comprehensive training is imparted 
to our company’s buyers and relevant personnel. We pursued this initiative downstream in 2019, wherein the Dealer Code 
of Conduct and the Dealer Sustainability Guidelines were developed to guide dealerships to improve their sustainability 
practices, along with assessments of their ESG performance through assessment questionnaires.
	
In FY 2023-24, we conducted assessments for 836 supply chain partners and franchise outlets across Commerical Vehicle, 
Passenger Vehicle and Electric Vehicle business.

Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of life, for 
(a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) Other waste.
	
Products post-consumer waste:
	
As a part of end-of-life product management, we are continuously working on improving our product’s circularity. It 
involves designing the vehicle for recyclability, selection of sustainable materials by studying their environmental impact, 
designing vehicle assemblies / components that are easy to dismantle and providing information about the same in our 
products, etc.
	
Design for recycling approach complements our initiative on circular economy, which aims to minimize waste and reduce 
the negative impact. During design stage, TML has been encouraging use of recyclable materials in the products and is 
actively working towards improving the product recyclability. Typically, all vehicles are designed to achieve minimum 85% 
recyclability and 90% recoverability.
	
At the end of the product lifecycle, scrapping and recycling of vehicles in a responsible way supports environmental goals. 
TML demonstrated its holistic commitment towards sustainable mobility with the launch of “Re.Wi.Re – Recycle with 
Respect” to facilitate the safe recycling of End-of-life Vehicles (ELV). The state-of-the-art TML Re.Wi.Re. facility is designed 
to dismantle end-of-life passenger and commercial vehicles of all brands. These facilities will drive responsible scrapping 
and recycling of end-of-life vehicles by using globally benchmarked and optimized processes. With the launch of Re.Wi.Re., 
TML aims to offer better value capture in downstream businesses, generate employment and support the minimization

of environmental pollution caused by aged vehicles. TML has opened four more Re.Wi.Re.facilities in a franchise-based 
model, now totaling five, with an annual capacity to dismantle more than 72,000 vehicles. We are committed to expanding 
Re.Wi.Re.facilities across the country to promote circularity and enhance and organize its value chain play. This move will 
lessen the pollution involved in the dismantling of ELVs and bring this activity within the organized sector.
	
Operations:
	
Our manufacturing operations generate various types of wastes which are covered under various National regulations. All 
our Plants ensure that the management of such wastes is done in full compliance of these legal requirements as specified 
by the operating permits, consents and authorizations. Our manufacturing operations receive a large and diverse number 
of parts, components and consumables in various forms of packaging which are discarded. These are segregated as 
per material type and shape and sold to re-cyclers for conversion and utilization. Specifically, we ensure the sale of all 
flexible and rigid plastic packaging to authorized plastic waste processors for re-cycling and utilization in manufacture 
of new packaging material. Hazardous and Other Waste are similarly routed to authorized re-cyclers or re-processors 
for material recovery or to co-processing for energy recovery through cement plants. We also ensure safe disposal of 
specific hazardous wastes as mandated in operating Consent/Authorizations, through Government authorized Treatment 
Storage and Disposal Facilities. E-wastes from our Operations, comprising of electronic devices, their components and IT 
assets that are discarded after their useful life or due to obsolescence, are disposed only to authorized re-cyclers. Where 
technically feasible, we are utilizing the recovered material such as reclaimed thinner, secondary paint made from paint 
sludge or sand from our foundries in our own manufacturing operations or in our supply chain.

Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities. If Yes, whether the waste

not, provide steps taken to address the same.
	
Yes, the EPR provisions under the Plastic Waste Management & Handling Rules, 2016 (as amended) are applicable to 
the Company. We are registered as a “Brand Owner” and as an “Importer” with the CPCB and have complied with the 
requirements of the Registration for the concluded year 2023-24. The Company have set up internal systems to track and 
ensure compliance on a running basis, for current year and beyond.
	
Legal compliance of our EPR target for FY 2023-24 has been ensured by the procurement of re-cycling certificates through 
a third party. Going forward, we will continue to fulfil our EPR targets through this route using the established systems 
for collection, transportation and the re-cycling of post-consumer plastic packaging waste. In the case of The Battery 
Waste Management Rules, 2022, the Company is Registered as a ‘Producer’ with the Central Pollution Control Board and is 
working towards meeting the necessary requirements going forward.

Accessibility of workplaces: Are the premises / offices of the entity accessible to differently abled employees and 
workers, as per the requirements of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016? If not, whether any steps are 
being taken by the entity in this regard.
	
The Company recognizes the importance of fostering an inclusive environment where Persons with Disabilities (PWD) are 
not just accommodated but actively empowered. As part of our commitment to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI), we 
are embarking on a strategic initiative to integrate PWD candidates seamlessly into our workforce. This strategy employs 
a multifaceted approach, encompassing proactive audits, civil works enhancements, along with parallel comprehensive

enhancements aimed at eliminating physical barriers and creating accessible spaces for PWD candidates. This includes but 
is not limited to, installing ramps, accessible restroom facilities, tactile markers and ergonomic workstations, ensuring that 
our workplaces are truly inclusive.
	
Comprehensive Sensitization Programs: We understand that creating an inclusive environment goes beyond physical 
accommodations; it requires a shift in mindset and cultural norms. Therefore, we will continue conducting the ONEderful 
Conversations that help comprehend the various defined DEI aspects. It is a half day workshop where trained facilitators 
from business is driving the agenda to the last level employee. Focus is on the people managers first who have a larger span 
of control. Topics like unconscious bias to building awareness about self – thoughts, realizing the various layers of inclusion

are all planned through an ONEderful kit. The program is aimed at raising awareness, dispelling myths and fostering 
empathy among employees.
	
Pilot Implementation: To test the effectiveness of our strategy, we will launch pilot programs at two primary locations 
within our organization. These pilots will serve as testbeds for refining our approach and identifying best practices that can 
be scaled across the organization.
	
Underlining Message of Inclusivity: Throughout our DEI communication, we will underline the message of inclusivity, 
emphasizing our intent to create an environment where every individual, regardless of ability, feels valued and respected. 
Our communication is a long term focused one which focuses on the intent behind our actions highlighting our commitment 
to diversity and inclusion as one of our foundational belief.
	
Readiness for Visitors and Employees: In addition to catering to our employees, we would ensure that our facilities are 
equally accessible and accommodating for visitors, including clients, partners and stakeholders. This ensures that our 
commitment to inclusivity is evident not only within our workforce but also in our interactions with external parties. We 
are in the process to build a uniform experience across locations.
	
In conclusion, TML is committed to fostering an inclusive workplace where PWD candidates are not just included but 
empowered to thrive. Through pilot implementations and inclusive communication, we aim to set a precedent for inclusivity 
in the automotive industry.

The performance of all management staff employees is managed through a performance appraisal process called 
LOOP. The performance management process facilitates open communication between managers and employees to 
clarify expectations, communicate organizational goals, provide feedback and offer continuous coaching for improving 
performance. This system employs a structured cascade of balanced scorecard objectives (at BU level) all the way down 
to individual targets, ensuring alignment across the organization. It integrates performance and leadership behavior 
appraisal, with rewards based on both company performance and individual contributions. Compensation reviews consider 
performance, leadership behavior and market comparisons, ultimately aiming to enhance business outcomes by defining 
and achieving goals effectively.
10.	 Health and safety management system:
	
a)	
Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? If Yes, the 
coverage of such systems?
	
	
TML prioritizes the health and safety of its employees, contractors, visitors and stakeholders through a comprehensive 
Health and Safety Management System. This system follows established safety standards across all business 
operations. A robust governance structure ensures implementation, with oversight from the Safety, Health and 
Sustainability Committee of the Board, Safety Councils, Plant Committees and joint committees with frontline staff. 
TML’s commitment to safety goes beyond compliance. Our core principles emphasize that safety and well-being 
of all stakeholders is critical to business success. This translates into focused training programs, thorough hazard 
identification procedures and ongoing efforts to cultivate a safety-conscious culture. All manufacturing sites are ISO 
45001 certified, demonstrating our adherence to the highest international safety standards and legal requirements.
	
b)	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis 
by the entity?
	
	
TML has a comprehensive approach to workplace safety that clearly outlines processes for identifying and mitigating 
hazards in both routine and non-routine activities:
	
	
TML utilizes Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA) Standard to proactively identify hazards before 
incidents occur.
	
	
Risk-Based Prioritization: Identified hazards are assigned a Risk Priority Number based on severity and likelihood, 
allowing for focused mitigation efforts.
	
	
Hierarchy of Controls: TML prioritizes the most effective controls, with elimination being the first choice, followed by 
substitution, engineering, administrative controls and finally Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).
	
	
Standardized Procedures: Identified risks and control measures are documented in Standard Operating Procedures 
(SOPs) for clear communication and consistent execution.
	
	
Adaptability: TML recognizes the need for continuous improvement. HIRAs are reviewed every six months and 
updated based on changes or incidents, leading to adjustments in SOPs.
	
	
For Non-Routine Activities:
	
	
Job Safety Analysis (JSA): This process identifies potential hazards associated with each step of a non-routine task.

Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report (BRSR)
	
	
Mitigation Plan: Once hazards are identified, a plan is created to reduce the risk of those hazards causing harm.
	
	
Issuance of Permit: In some cases, a permit system is used to control access to the work area and ensure only 
authorized personnel with proper training can perform the non-routine activity.
	
	
Barricading Activities Area: Physical barriers are set up to restrict access to the work zone and prevent unauthorized 
entry, protecting individuals not involved in the task from exposure to hazards.
	
	
Beyond these initial assessments, our risk management goes a step further. We incorporate a “step back 2by2” 
approach, which involves regular safety discussions at all levels and toolbox talks to keep safety top-of-mind. 
Additionally, for specific high-hazard areas with specialized risks, we utilize advanced assessment processes like 
HAZOP (Hazard Operability) and Quantitative Risk Assessment.
	
c)	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work related hazards and to remove themselves from 
such risks.
	
	
Encouraging employee participation is crucial for maintaining a safe work environment. TML has established processes 
for workers to report work-related hazards and to take action or report for removing these risks:
	
	
Digital Reporting Platform: The Company provides a convenient and accessible digital platform for employees to 
report incidents, observations and near misses. 
	
	
Multiple Reporting Avenues: Various reporting avenues such as Safety Observation Process (SO), Action Employee 
Can Take (AECT), Near Miss Reporting and Self-Directed Team (SDT) safety point leaders programs cater to different 
situations and employee preferences.
	
	
Focus on Proactive Measures: Encouraging the reporting of near misses allows for the identification and addressing 
of potential hazards before they cause accidents.
	
	
There are active safety committees for workers to report and take action for removal of risks and control of hazards 
in the work place.
	
d)	
Do the employees / workers of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services? 
	
	
Yes, all plants have Medical Centres equipped and manned for management of non-occupational medical conditions. 
Further, all employees are covered under health insurance, statutory health insurance or ESIC as per eligibility for 
non-occupational medical and healthcare services.

Provide details of any corrective actions taken or underway to address significant risks / concerns arising from 
assessments of health and safety practices and working conditions of value chain partners.
	
The Company implements several practices for its value chain partners to address significant risks and concerns arising 
from assessments of health and safety practices and working conditions:
	
i.	
Defensive Driver Training: Equips drivers with skills to anticipate and avoid hazards, reducing the risk of accidents 
and injuries.
	
ii.	
Authorized Drivers Only: Limits driving within workshops to authorized personnel, minimizing risks associated with 
inexperienced or unqualified drivers.
	
iii.	
Daily Work Management (DWM): Focuses on planning, coordinating and controlling work activities, potentially 
reducing safety issues arising from misunderstandings or improper procedures.
	
iv.	
Safety Committees: Provide a platform for workers to raise safety concerns and collaborate on improvement initiatives.
	
v.	
Safety Champions: Empower employees to take ownership of safety within their workshops, fostering a culture of 
safety awareness.
	
vi.	
Monthly Safety Audits: Regularly identify and address safety gaps, ensuring ongoing improvement.
	
vii.	 Sharing Best Practices: Allows successful safety initiatives across the value chain to be adopted by others, 
maximizing effectiveness.
	
By implementing these practices, TML demonstrates a commitment to safety throughout its value chain, extending the 
focus beyond its own facilities. This not only protects employees and partners but also potentially contributes to a safer 
overall transportation and work environment.

Leadership Indicators
1.	
Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental and social 
topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.
	
We firmly believe in maintaining an ongoing dialogue with our stakeholders, demonstrating our commitment to 
transparency and accountability. Our leadership actively engages with stakeholders through various platforms to ensure 
the feedback from stakeholders are incorporated on economic, environmental or social topics.
	
To facilitate this engagement, we have established several committees dedicated to key areas of concern. The 
Safety, Health and Sustainability (SHS) Committee rigorously assesses our performance in environmental, social and 
governance (ESG) matters, overseeing the implementation of relevant policies and strategies to drive sustainable 
practices.
	
The Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Committee plays a pivotal role in formulating and recommending CSR policies to 
the Board. Additionally, it meticulously monitors CSR budget allocations, activities and expenditures to ensure alignment 
with our commitment to social responsibility.
	
Furthermore, our Stakeholders’ Relationship Committee is entrusted with evaluating statutory compliances and services 
related to dividend payments, security holders and the performance of Registrar and Transfer Agents, thereby enhancing 
trust and transparency in our interactions.
	
In line with our dedication to shareholder engagement, we offer shareholders the opportunity to interact with all 
board members annually during the Annual General Meeting. This forum allows us to stay attuned to the evolving 
needs and concerns of our stakeholders, reinforcing our pledge to remain accountable and responsive to their 
interests.

to stakeholders and the leadership team, who rated each topic based on its impact on business and sustainability. 
Stakeholder responses were then prioritized as High, Medium, or Low, helping TML identify key material topics. Finally, 
senior management reviewed these identified topics for further action.

Is the premise / office of the entity accessible to differently abled visitors, as per the requirements of the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016?
	
In an era where inclusivity is not just a buzzword but a fundamental aspect of societal progress, ensuring accessibility for 
differently abled individuals within office premises has become a crucial endeavor. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities

people with disabilities. As we strive to adhere to these regulations, they are presented with various strategies to enhance 
premise and office accessibility, especially in locations that pose unique challenges.
	
i.	
Understanding the Landscape: TML is based out of from diverse locations, ranging from modern commercial spaces to 
heritage buildings with historical significance. Each setting presents its own set of challenges and opportunities in terms 
of accessibility. While some commercial locations may already boast inclusive premises due to modern construction 
norms or proactive measures, older buildings may require significant retrofitting to meet accessibility standards.

Assessing the Need: To embark on the journey of creating inclusive premises, we are kick starting comprehensive 
accessibility audits. These audits serve as invaluable tools in identifying barriers to accessibility and prioritizing areas 
for improvement. By mapping out the current state of accessibility, we are developing a clear roadmap for action, 
ensuring that resources are allocated effectively and efficiently.
	
iii.	
Implementing Solutions: Once the audit process is complete, we can begin implementing measures to enhance 
accessibility. These measures may include:
	
	
a.	
Physical Modifications: Retrofitting entrances with ramps, widening doorways, installing handrails and ensuring 
accessible restroom facilities are just a few examples of physical modifications that can greatly improve 
accessibility for differently abled individuals.
	
	
b.	
Technological Solutions: We would also leverage technology can also play a significant role in enhancing 
accessibility. From automated doors and elevators to assistive devices such as screen readers and braille 
displays, technology can bridge gaps and empower individuals with disabilities to navigate office spaces 
more independently.
	
	
c.	
Training and Sensitization: It’s not just about physical infrastructure; fostering a culture of inclusivity within 
the organization is equally important. Providing training and sensitization sessions for employees promotes 
awareness and understanding of the challenges faced by differently abled individuals, fostering a more inclusive 
work environment.
	
	
d.	
Collaboration and Partnerships: We are also leveraging collaborations and partnerships with disability rights 
organizations, accessibility experts and government agencies to gain insights and support in their journey 
towards creating inclusive premises.

Embracing Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI): Ultimately, the pursuit of accessibility within office premises is deeply 
intertwined with broader efforts towards diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). By prioritizing accessibility, we not only 
fulfill legal obligations but also demonstrate a commitment to creating environments where every individual, regardless of 
ability, can thrive and contribute meaningfully.

Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If Yes, provide details of its coverage 
and implementation.
	
Our operations in India span across the states of Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Gujarat, Maharashtra and 
Karnataka. The management of treated effluents generated during plant operations and their disposal is outlined in 
the individual plant operating consent orders issued by the respective State Pollution Control Boards, which our plants 
diligently adhere to.
	
Aligned with these consent orders/authorizations, certain plants have implemented comprehensive tertiary treatment, i.e. 
Reverse Osmosis systems to recycle treated effluents for process reuse, while others ensure Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) by 
repurposing treated effluents for secondary purposes such as toilet flushing and / or maintaining greenbelt development 
within the plant premises and adjacent green areas belonging to the plants.
	
Moving forward, our approach will embrace a holistic perspective, encompassing all aspects of water sourcing and 
its efficient utilization. Our ongoing efforts are reducing freshwater usage by increasing treated effluent usage in our 
processes and for other sanitation purposes. Efforts are on to increase water augmentation through rainwater harvesting 
and recharge within the plant and outside premises, as TML strives towards achieving a ‘Water Positive’ status by the 
year 2030.

	Case title: CV Abuse of dominance case (Complaint filed by Mrs. Neha Gupta and Mr. Nishant Bhutada): In the year 2021, 
CCI ordered its Director General (“DG”) to conduct an investigation on the complaint against TML, TMFL and TCFSL for 
concerting together to form a cartel, abusing their dominance in the vehicle market and causing irreparable financial losses 
to its dealers. TMFL and TCFSL were dropped by CCI from the investigation. The DG submitted the report with CCI prima 
facie holding TML guilty of imposing territorial restrictions on its dealers from selling the vehicles. TML filed its objections 
to the DG’s report and, finally the CCI vide its order dated 23.08.2023 decided the matter is favour of TML thereby setting 
aside the DG’s report and the complaints filed by both the informants. The CCI held that while TML is a dominant player in 
commercial vehicles market, there is no case made out against it either under the provisions of Section 3 (anti-competitive 
practices) or Section 4 (abuse of dominance) of the Act.
	
Mrs. Neha Gupta has filed an appeal before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (“NCLAT”) against the above 
Order of CCI and the same is pending for further proceedings.

Independent Practitioners’ Reasonable Assurance Report
This engagement was conducted by a multidisciplinary 
team including assurance practitioners, engineers and 
environmental and social practitioners.
In our opinion, the company’s Identified Sustainability 
Information in “Business Responsibility and Sustainability 
Report” section of the Integrated Annual Report for 
the period 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024, subject to 
reasonable assurance is prepared, in all material respects, in 
accordance with the Regulation 34(2)(f) of the Securities and 
Exchange Board of India  (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (SEBI LODR) and basis of 
preparation set out in Section A: General Disclosures 13 
of “Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report” of 
Integrated Annual Report.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our engagement in accordance with 
International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 
3000 (Revised), Assurance Engagements Other than Audits 
or Reviews of Historical Financial Information issued by 
the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board 
(IAASB). Our responsibilities under those standards are 
further described in the “Our responsibilities” section of 
our report.
We have complied with the independence and other 
ethical requirements of the International Code of Ethics 
for 
Professional 
Accountants 
(including 
International 
Independence Standards) issued by the International Ethics 
Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA).
Our firm applies International Standard on Quality 
Management (ISQM) 1, Quality Management for Firms that 
Perform Audits or Reviews of Financial Statements, or Other 
Assurance or Related Services Engagements, issued by the 
IAASB. This standard requires the firm to design, implement 
and operate a system of quality management, including 
policies or procedures regarding compliance with ethical 
requirements, professional standards and applicable legal 
and regulatory requirements.
We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Other information
Management and the Board of Directors are responsible 
for the other information. We have performed a limited 
assurance engagement on select BRSR and GRI indicators and 
issued an independent assurance report on 29 May 2024.
Our report thereon is included with the other information. 
Our reasonable assurance opinion on the ISI does not 
extend to other information that accompanies or contains 
the ‘ISI and our assurance report’ (hereafter referred to as 
“other information”). We have read the other information 
in “Sustainability review” and “Business Responsibility and 
Sustainability Report” sections of the Integrated Annual

Report, but we have not performed any procedures with 
respect to the other information.
Other matter
Select BRSR Core attributes of the Company for the year 
ended 31 March 2023 were assured by the previous assurance 
practitioner who had expressed an unmodified opinion on 
10th June, 2023. 
Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.
Intended use or purpose
The ISI and our reasonable assurance report are intended 
for users who have reasonable knowledge of the BRSR Core 
attributes, the reporting criteria and ISI and who have read 
the information in the ISI with reasonable diligence and 
understand that the ISI is prepared and assured at appropriate 
levels of materiality.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.
Responsibilities for the Identified Sustainability 
Information (ISI) 
The management of the Company acknowledge and 
understand their responsibility for: 
•	
designing, implementing and maintaining internal 
controls relevant to the preparation of the ISI that is 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error;
•	
selecting or establishing suitable criteria for preparing the 
ISI, taking into account applicable laws and regulations, 
if any, related to reporting on the ISI, identification of 
key aspects, engagement with stakeholders, content, 
preparation and presentation of the ISI in accordance 
with the reporting criteria;
•	
disclosure of the applicable criteria used for preparation 
of the ISI in the relevant report/statement; 
•	
preparing/properly calculating the ISI in accordance 
with the reporting criteria; and 
•	
ensuring the reporting criteria is available for the 
intended users with relevant explanation;
•	
establishing targets, goals and other performance 
measures and implementing actions to achieve such 
targets, goals and performance measures;
•	
responsible for providing the details of the management 
personnel who takes ownership of the ISI disclosed in 
the report;
•

compliance 
with 
law, 
regulation

the circumstances; 
•

with the ISI;
•	
supervision of other staff involved in the preparation of 
the ISI.
Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing 
the reporting process for the Company’s ISI.
Inherent limitations in preparing the ISI
The preparation of the company’s BRSR information requires 
the management to establish or interpret the criteria, make 
determinations about the relevancy of information to be 
included and make estimates and assumptions that affect the 
reported information.
Measurement of certain amounts and BRSR Core metrics, 
some of which are estimates, is subject to substantial inherent 
measurement uncertainty, for example, GHG emissions, water 
footprint, energy footprint. Obtaining sufficient appropriate 
evidence to support our opinion/conclusion does not reduce 
the uncertainty in the amounts and metrics. 
Our responsibilities
We are responsible for:
•	
Planning and performing the engagement to obtain 
reasonable assurance on the sustainability disclosures 
in the BRSR Core are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, in accordance with the 
Reporting Criteria in line with the section above. 
•	
Forming an independent opinion, based on the 
procedures we have performed and the evidence we 
have obtained and
•	
Reporting our reasonable assurance opinion to the 
Directors of Tata Motors Limited. 
Exclusions
Our assurance scope excludes the following and therefore we 
will not express a conclusion on the same:

Summary of the work we performed as the 
basis for our conclusion
We exercised professional judgment and maintained 
professional skepticism throughout the engagement. We 
designed and performed our procedures to obtain evidence 
that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our reasonable assurance opinion. The nature, timing 
and extent of the procedures selected depended on our 
judgment, including an assessment of the risks of material 
misstatement of the information subject to reasonable 
assurance, whether due to fraud or error. We identified 
and assessed the risks of material misstatement through 
understanding the Information subject to reasonable 
assurance and the engagement circumstances. We also 
obtained an understanding of the internal control relevant to 
the information subject to reasonable assurance in order to 
design procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances 
but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the 
effectiveness of internal controls. 
In carrying out our engagement, we:
•	
assessed 
the 
suitability 
of 
the 
criteria 
used 
by the company in preparing the reasonable 
assurance information; 
•	
evaluated the appropriateness of reporting policies, 
quantification methods and models used in the 
preparation of the information subject to reasonable 
assurance and the reasonableness of estimates made by 
the company; and 
•	
evaluated the overall presentation of the information 
subject to reasonable assurance.
