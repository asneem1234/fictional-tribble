Director’s Message
Dear Stakeholders,
I am extremely pleased to present our Business Responsibility 
and Sustainability Report (BRSR) for FY2023-24, underscoring 
our unwavering commitment to sustainability and creating 
long-term value for all our stakeholders.
We continue to integrate principles of sustainability within 
our business through well-defined goals and initiatives 
coupled with a clear roadmap to achieve these objectives. 
This report demonstrates our efforts to integrate 
sustainability into our operations while providing a holistic 
view of our Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) 
performance for FY2023-24.
We are strongly focused on our core value of “Reaching 
People. Touching Lives”. Our diverse product portfolio and 
global presence enables us to deliver high-quality medicines 
to positively impact the well-being of patients. We also 
continue to invest in R&D to develop new and innovative 
molecules and improve accessibility.
At Sun Pharma, we are committed to addressing the impact 
of climate change through strategic actions to manage and 
mitigate carbon emissions associated with our operations. 
In FY2023-24, we initiated a physical and transition climate 
risk assessment for all our locations and also carried out a 
Biodiversity risk assessment for five of our manufacturing 
locations. We will continue to evaluate our exposure 
to climate change related risks and opportunities and 
implement necessary mitigation measures as required.
We have set targets to address Scope 1 and Scope 2 
emissions, water consumption, and Co-processing of 
hazardous waste. We aim to achieve a 35% reduction in our 
absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon emissions by 2030, 
compared to the baseline year of 2020. Over the last four 
years, we have reduced our combined Scope 1 and Scope 2 
carbon emissions by 21.85%. We are allocating significant 
investments for projects in renewable energy and for our 
energy saving initiatives. Renewable energy now accounts 
for 45.23% in our overall energy mix.
We also target to achieve a 10% reduction in our water 
consumption by 2025, compared to the baseline year of 
2020. Our water management initiatives have helped us to 
minimise our water footprint and reduce water consumption 
by 31.17% compared to the base year of 2020. We have 
further set a target to co-process 30% of hazardous waste 
by 2025. In FY 2023-24 we have co-processed 28.34% of 
hazardous waste.
Our people form the foundation of our success. We have 
implemented various focused initiatives to attract and retain 
a highly diverse and skilled workforce. This further drives 
innovation and fosters synergy, giving us a competitive 
edge. Through a systemic approach, we make focused 
efforts towards fostering a conducive working environment 
for employees through training and inclusive policies that 
promotes employee well-being and resource development. 
Our people-centric philosophy fosters empowerment of our 
employees to reach their fullest potential, trust building and 
propels them to achieve organisational objectives.
Ensuring safety of our workforce is a key priority for us. 
We have inculcated best-in-class safety practices aligned 
with our Environment, Health, and Safety (EHS) Policy. We 
also carry out extensive health and safety related training 
programs across all our locations directed at creating a 
culture of safety, awareness and responsible behavior.
Our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives continue 
to positively impact underprivileged communities and 
respond to their needs in areas like healthcare, education, 
water & sanitation, rural development, and environmental 
conservation. We implement focused and socially responsible 
initiatives with the objective of holistic development of our 
local communities. Furthermore, our CSR programs are 
designed to contribute towards the realisation of the United 
Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs).
Our holistic corporate governance framework is the 
foundation of our commitment to uphold the highest 
standards of ethical governance, and enabling sustainable 
outcomes for all our stakeholders. Our corporate 
governance approach rests on our commitment of going 
beyond compliance, increasing transparency and fostering 
reliability, trust and consistency. Under the guidance of our 
Board, we have established various committees focusing 
on different aspects of responsible business practices. 
Our comprehensive set of corporate policies help us in 
implementation of these practices. We also employ a secure 
grievance redressal and global whistle blower mechanism 
for our stakeholders, enabling us to uphold our values and 
highest standards of corporate governance.
Furthermore, as a member of the United Nations Global 
Compact (UNGC), we support the 10 principles covering 
human rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption and we 
are committed to ensure that these principles are a part of 
our overall business strategy.
While we continue to integrate sustainability principles into 
our operations, and deliver on our promises of sustainable 
value creation, we welcome your valuable feedback in order 
to improve our sustainability performance.
Regards,
Aalok Shanghvi

Corporate 
Governance 
and Business

markets, to ensure compliance 
and reduce any possibility of non- 
compliance.
2. 
 Focused and regular training is 
provided to all staff members to

commitment to ethical and 
responsible business practices 
and continual regulatory 
compliance will be positively 
regarded by stakeholders,

 Ensure continued and strict 
compliance with global quality 
standards and protocols and

Negative: Significant concerns 
with product safety and quality 
could lead to recalls and 
regulatory alerts, temporarily 
impair business operations, 
and harm our reputation and 
brand. It could also result in 
legal repercussions, fines and 
penalties.
 
3.
Cyber Security 
and Data 
Privacy
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Any potential cybersecurity 
and data privacy risk/threat 
directly affects the security and 
integrity of the IT system of the 
entire business.
Opportunity: Providing for a 
secured IT network through a 
strong governance mechanism 
for data integrity, technology, 
and digitalisation, which in 
turn enhances productivity 
and facilitates continuity of 
operations and thereby enhance 
the business performance.
1. 
 Regular vulnerability assessments 
and simulated hacker attacks of our 
IT systems are undertaken to prevent 
breaches of Company or stakeholders’ 
data.
2. 
 We’ve implemented patch 
management, antivirus software, 
IT monitoring systems, and perimeter 
protection to reduce the risks 
associated with cyber security and 
data breaches. Furthermore, we 
regularly provide training to our 
staff members on cybersecurity and 
reaffirm this knowledge through 
recurring internal emails that address 
secure data practices, safeguarding 
against phishing emails, and 
averting hacker attacks.
Positive: Compliance and 
alignment with data security 
and privacy laws is maintained 
through adoption of cutting-
edge technology, digitalisation, 
and adherence to data integrity 
principles ingrained in our 
processes. This safeguards against 
data loss, enhances productivity, 
and fosters sustainable long-term 
growth.
Negative: The absence of a 
strong data integrity and security 
mechanism significantly increases 
the risk of data breaches, 
potentially leading to the loss 
of valuable data with potential 
adverse effects on the business.
Breaches of customer/
stakeholder data may expose us 
to litigation, fines, and penalties.

Management 
Opportunity
Opportunity: Investing in 
innovation and technology to 
develop and commercialise 
a robust product portfolio, 
including generics and specialty 
products, enables us to address 
unmet patient needs and 
enhance product accessibility in 
global markets.
Positive: Enhancing our portfolio 
with innovative products will 
effectively meet the unmet 
healthcare needs of patients 
globally and thereby enhancing 
access to new therapies. 
Furthermore, process innovation 
can lead to increased productivity 
and resource efficiency in our 
operations.
5.
Human Capital 
Development
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Human Capital 
Development encompasses 
talent management, including 
acquisition, retention, and 
employee well-being. Failure 
to meet or exceed employee 
expectations may negatively 
impact employee retention, 
productivity, and business 
continuity, given our business’s 
dependence on the well-being of 
our people.
Opportunity: The Company’s 
emphasis on enhancing employee 
welfare and development 
underscores its commitment to 
human capital development. This 
fosters retention and attracts 
top talent, driving productivity, 
innovation, long-term business 
growth, and value creation for all 
stakeholders.
1. 
 We implement various initiatives to 
attract and retain talent, including 
global talent management programs, 
competitive compensation, fostering 
an inclusive work culture, and offering 
employee benefits programs.
2. 
 We have established a formal 
succession planning program for all 
leadership positions.
3. 
 We prioritise employee skill 
enhancement through continuous 
training and development 
opportunities.
Positive: Concentrated efforts 
on human capital development 
yield a motivated workforce with 
high retention and satisfaction 
rates. These indicators showcase 
the Company’s commitment 
to nurturing a positive work 
environment and underscore a 
proactive approach to workforce 
development, crucial for long-
term growth and sustainability.
Negative: Neglecting to meet 
employee expectations could 
lead to adverse long-term effects 
on productivity and hinder the 
Company’s growth trajectory.
6.
Access to and 
Affordability of 
Medicines 
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Addressing challenges 
related to the product portfolio, 
accessibility, and pricing is crucial 
in the pharmaceutical sector. 
Limited access to medicines 
due to pricing and availability 
issues negatively affects society’s 
access to healthcare and may 
pose obstacles to aligning 
with the Company’s vision and 
long-term growth potential.
Opportunity: Leveraging our 
robust generic and specialty 
product portfolio alongside our 
global presence, the Company is 
well-equipped to enhance access 
to medicines worldwide and 
meet the increasing demand for 
pharmaceutical products.
1. 
 We prioritise building a robust and 
diversified product portfolio through 
improved cross-functional synergies, 
organisational capabilities, project 
management, and governance 
throughout the product lifecycle.
2. 
 We enhance our capabilities in both 
in-licensing and out-licensing of 
products.
3. 
 Our focus lies on the development 
and commercialisation of complex 
generics and specialty products, 
among other priorities.
4. 
 We emphasise operational excellence 
programs aimed at improving yields, 
ensuring supply chain continuity, and 
maintaining sufficient inventory levels.
Positive: The Company’s 
commitment to product 
innovation and research elevates 
brand value through a diverse 
range of accessible and affordable 
products. This strategy enables us 
to address unmet patient needs 
and extends access to low and 
middle-income countries.
Negative: Long-term brand 
value and growth prospects 
may suffer if the Company’s 
products become inaccessible or 
if expansion into new geographic 
markets is hindered.
7.
Environmental 
Impact 
Management
Risk
Risk: For the business to have a 
positive environmental impact, 
waste and water management 
are essential.
To show that the business is 
dedicated to a sustainable 
future and a healthy world, 
concentrated efforts must be 
made to limit waste generation, 
consumption of water, and 
proper disposal.
1. 
 We continue to identify 
opportunities to minimise any 
adverse environmental effect from 
our operations. We have adopted 
targets for waste management and 
water conservation. Our targets are 
to reduce water consumption by 10% 
and to co-process 30% of hazardous 
waste by 2025.
2. 
 We closely monitor and track our 
waste management and water 
consumption. Our priorities are to 
increase water efficiency, decrease 
water withdrawal, and increase water 
recovery. For waste management, we 
focus on co-processing hazardous 
waste and increasing recycling and 
reuse within our own operations. 
Negative: Neglecting 
environmental effects can result 
in unfavorable legal, regulatory, 
and financial repercussions, a 
decline in shareholder trust and 
reputation, and finally could lead 
to potential loss of an operating 
license.
Patient First. Always.

Climate Change Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: In the absence of effective 
management of greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions, the business 
could be at risk of Physical and 
transition risks associated with 
climate change that could cause 
operations to be disrupted and 
have an impact on business 
continuity.
Opportunity: Adopting new 
low-carbon technology will help 
build business resilience and 
opportunities for more effective 
manufacturing procedures.
1. 
 The company has set a 35% reduction 
target for absolute carbon emissions 
(Scope 1 and Scope 2) by 2030 
compared to baseline of 2020.
2. 
 To identify and assess the physical and 
transitional risks associated with our 
operations, we have also undertaken 
climate risk assessments.
3. 
 By boosting the proportion of 
biomass, obtaining renewable 
energy, and putting energy efficiency 
programs into place to maximise 
our energy usage, we are constantly 
looking for ways to lessen our 
dependence on fossil fuels in our 
operations.
Negative: Our assets could 
be harmed by possible direct 
physical threats to our activities, 
which consequently, can result 
in a halt to operations and a 
rise in the cost of repairing and 
rebuilding affected locations. The 
transition risks brought on by 
climate change may also lead to 
stricter laws in the nations where 
we do business and export, 
which would increase the cost of 
compliance or new technology 
investments. Losing reputation 
and the trust of stakeholders 
can also result from a failure to 
respond to the negative effects of 
climate change.
Positive: Businesses may be able 
to adapt newer technologies 
and more productive ways of 
producing goods by working 
toward climate change adaptation 
and mitigation. 
9.
Diversity, 
Equity and 
Inclusivity
Opportunity
Opportunity: Fostering and 
providing for a diverse and 
inclusive workforce and 
work culture enhances our 
performance by bringing together 
people with varied experiences, 
knowledge and skills. 
Positive: A diverse and inclusive 
workforce that includes members 
of all genders, ages, ethnicities, 
and special abilities fosters 
creative thinking, encourages 
employee engagement, and 
unlocks higher levels of 
efficiency.
10.
Sustainable 
Supply Chain 
and Responsible 
Procurement
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: As a result of the 
Company’s dependence on the 
supply chain for critical raw 
materials and last-mile drug 
deliveries, any interruption in 
the supply chain could have 
an effect on the quality of 
the final product and/or the 
business of the Company. There 
is also a risk associated with 
non-substitutable suppliers’ 
continuous availability of 
essential raw materials.
The Company has a policy 
requiring its supply chain 
partners to follow its ESG 
standards; any violation might 
lead to a supply disruption.
Opportunity: An organisation’s 
supply chain has a major impact 
on its capacity to survive.
Integrating sustainability 
principles within supply chain 
management aids the Company 
in creating a robust supply chain 
and enhancing environmentally 
and socially conscious behavior 
throughout the value chain. 
1. 
 We are constantly looking for ways to 
reduce supply chain risk, such as by 
assessing potential substitute sources 
for essential or non-replaceable raw 
materials.
2. 
 The suppliers are required to abide by 
the Company’s ESG requirements as 
part of the Supplier Code of Conduct.
3. 
 The Company has a high focus on 
developing quality products and safety 
of consumers. The quality of raw 
materials for our production process 
is ensured by conducting periodic 
supplier audits.
Negative: Long-term commercial 
partnerships with suppliers may 
be impacted if standards related 
to various social, environmental 
and safety aspects are not 
complied with by suppliers, 
leading to loss of business value. 
Non-substitutable and critical raw 
material suppliers may impact 
the business in case of any 
unforeseen disruptions.
Positive: The Company’s 
ability to address supply chain 
disruptions brought on by 
unprecedented circumstances is 
ensured by responsible supply 
chain practices. In addition, the 
Company’s adherence to its 
responsible sourcing enhances 
its social and environmental 
performance. Assessing alternate 
suppliers may also help reduce 
risk exposure and provide 
access to previously unexplored 
suppliers for raw materials. 
It may lead to discovery of 
local suppliers, which reduces 
environmental footprint and may 
result in better control over the

Occupational 
Health and 
Safety
Risk
Risk: The Company’s 
commitment to occupational 
health and safety must include 
this crucial element in the 
direction of offering a secure and 
safe workplace.
Numerous health and safety 
incidents could result from 
the inefficiency of the current 
health and safety management 
programs.
1. 
 The business maintains a robust 
Environmental Health and Safety 
(EHS) management system, comprising 
regular audits of its EHS procedures, 
both internal and external.
2. 
 Our Process Safety Management 
system’s guiding principles serve as 
the foundation for both our safety 
procedures and risk assessment 
methodology, which unifies our 
approach to health and safety from 
the perspectives of working conditions 
and risk assessment.
3. 
 After potential risks are identified 
and safety incidents are evaluated, 
a thorough corrective action plan is 
established to prevent occurrence of 
similar incidents in the future.
Negative: A regular occurrence 
of health and safety issues 
will negatively impact the 
performance of the Company 
concerning worker well-being and 
safety. This will have an effect on 
the Company’s reputation, brand 
image, and capacity to draw in 
and retain talent. 
12.
Ethical Clinical 
Trials and 
Animal Testing
Risk
Risk: Addressing risks associated 
with clinical trials and animal 
testing is critical to demonstrate 
the Company’s commitment to 
responsible research practices, 
especially around the ethical and 
safety related concerns of trials 
on human subjects and animal 
testing. Adverse events related 
to research practices can cause 
delays in product development 
and lead to financial losses and 
negative public perception.
1. 
 The Company complies with all 
relevant regulatory requirements 
governing clinical trials and animal 
testing. We have dedicated teams, 
responsible for ensuring compliance 
with these regulations, which involve 
obtaining necessary approvals, 
permits, and maintaining thorough 
documentation.
2. 
 We also implement robust quality 
control and safety measures 
throughout the research process.
 
 This involves monitoring and auditing 
the conduct of clinical trials, data 
collection, and analysis to ensure 
accuracy, reliability, and compliance 
with relevant standards.
3. 
 Long term safety studies are 
undertaken for some of our 
innovative specialty products, 
post commercialisation, in order 
to evaluate and measure safety 
parameters over a longer time horizon.
4. 
 On certain projects we collaborate 
with academic institutions, research 
organisations, and regulatory agencies 
to share knowledge, expertise, and 
resources. Such collaborations also 
enable collective efforts, checks and 
balances to enhance the quality and 
ethical standards of clinical trials and 
animal testing.
Negative: Failure to comply with 
guidelines and regulations of 
clinical trials and animal testing 
can undermine the efficacy and 
safety of the Company’s clinical 
trials. It may also have an adverse 
regulatory/legal impact, lead to 
financial damages and reputation 
loss and have a negative impact 
on participant’s health and safety.
Delays at any stage can also 
prolong the overall timeline for 
drug development, leading to 
increased costs.
13.
Social Impact 
through 
Community 
Engagement
Opportunity
Opportunity: By aligning CSR 
programs with the needs of the 
community, through impact 
assessments and stakeholder 
engagement sessions, the 
Company focuses on creating an 
environment of mutual trust with 
the community. This will help in 
ensuring a long-term beneficial 
relationship with the community 
and enhance the social 
positioning of the Company.
Positive: The Company’s 
perception among the local 
community members is 
enhanced by its contributions 
to the community’s upliftment 
through various initiatives and 
partnerships that focus on health, 
Education, rural infrastructure 
development, sanitation, and 
environment conservation 
among others. These efforts also 
help to promote positive social 
outcomes.

 The Company has a comprehensive complaint management process to facilitate timely redressal of the product quality 
complaints. Once a product quality complaint is received, either directly by the Company or through a third-party 
entity (appointed to handle product complaints), and registered in the Company’s system, it is acknowledged, and a 
preliminary assessment is undertaken. In certain markets, based on local requirements, a Field Alert Report (FAR) may 
be filed for the complaint depending on its nature and severity. Along with the initial evaluation, a follow-up is initiated 
for requesting the complaint sample and any additional information to facilitate the preliminary assessment and the 
investigation. The initial risk assessment and the investigative process proceeds concurrently with the follow-up. A 
remedial action plan is launched after the investigation is completed and the root cause is determined. A complaint 
summary report is also prepared at the same time. The complaint is finally closed after a final risk assessment is 
completed and a response is delivered to the complainant. Any market actions for the impacted product are considered 
and may be communicated with the local regulatory authorities depending on local requirements. The Company has a 
global Pharmacovigilance Policy and mechanism in place, which is supported by a product safety group, committed to 
responding to patient safety concerns and incidents.
