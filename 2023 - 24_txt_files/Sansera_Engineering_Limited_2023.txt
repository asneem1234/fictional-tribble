Risk 
Automotive

manufacturin
g is a high-
emission 
activity that 
faces scrutiny 
from 
major 
stakeholders 
such 
as 
customers, 
investors, 
and 
governments
. Customers 
may demand 
commitment
s to reduce 
greenhouse 
gas 
(GHG) 
emissions or 
impose 
conditions 
related 
to 
emissions for 
conducting 
business. 
Certain 
investors 
focused 
on 
environment

governance 
(ESG) criteria 
may 
only 
invest 
in 
companies 
that 
meet 
GHG 
reduction 
targets. The 
government 
is also in the 
process 
of 
establishing a 
cap-and-
trade 
emissions 
trading 
GHG 
emissions 
can 
be 
mitigated 
by 
(1) 
Conducting 
energy 
audits and 
identifying 
areas 
of 
energy 
reduction 
(2) Sourcing 
of 
renewable 
energy. 
In 
the current 
financial 
year, a total 
of 54% of 
electrical 
energy was 
sourced 
from 
renewable 
sources. 
Failure to mitigate 
GHG emissions could 
lead 
to 
potential 
business 
loss, 
disinterest 
from 
specific groups of 
investors, 
and 
increased costs to 
comply 
with 
regulatory 
requirements.

Waste 
Management 
Risk/Opportu
nity 
Inadequate 
handling of 
hazardous 
waste by 
waste 
management 
contractors 
poses risks to 
land, water 
bodies, and 
biodiversity. 
Embracing 
circular 
economy 
principles for 
waste 
recycling 
could offer 
Sansera a 
significant 
opportunity 
to reduce 
waste 
generation.  
Ensuring 
that 
hazardous 
waste is 
handled 
and 
disposed by 
only 
authorized 
contractors 
of the State 
Pollution 
Control 
Board.  
Circular

initiatives 
such as (1) 
recycling of 
discarded 
scrap steel 
(2) ensuring 
zero waste 
to landfill 
Negative 
financial 
implications 
could 
result in the form of 
capital expenditure 
for 
recycling 
of 
discarded 
scrap 
steel. 
Financial 
implications 
could 
also result in the 
form 
of 
compensation 
for 
improper handling of 
hazardous waste.

Sansera's 
manufacturin

significant 
amount of

saving

only 
contributes 
to our 
financial 
performance 
but also 
helps us 
reach our 
emissions

targets. 
Identifying 
areas of

Health and safety management system: 
a 
Whether an occupational health and 
safety management system has been 
implemented by the entity? (Yes/ No). If 
yes, the coverage such system? 
Yes, the Health and Safety Management system covers 
activities across most of our manufacturing locations, 
offices, research laboratories, and supply chain partners and 
ensures the protection of the environment and the health 
and safety of the Company’s employees, contractors, 
visitors, and relevant stakeholders. 13 out of 17 plants are 
covered by ISO 45001 (TUV NORD). 
b 
What are the processes used to identify 
work-related hazards and assess risks on 
a routine and non-routine basis by the 
entity? 
The Company has implemented a Hazard Identification and 
Risk Assessment (HIRA) system for identifying workplace 
hazards, undertaking risk assessments, and implementing 
necessary controls to mitigate and address risks.  
Sansera identifies possible workplace incidents using a 
hazard identification process, followed by a likelihood 
assessment to estimate their frequency or probability. 
Measures are then implemented to either prevent these 
incidents by reducing their likelihood or control them to 
limit their extent and duration, thereby mitigating adverse 
effects or consequences. In addition to this, the Company 
has prepared an Emergency Preparedness Plan, and OCP - 
Operation control procedure/Standards to minimise work-
related hazards, among others. SEL ensures HIRA for all 
activities and products and conducts HIRA studies on an 
annual basis or as and when required. The necessary 
guidelines are implemented in line with ISO 45001.  
c 
Whether you have processes for 
workers to report the work-related 
hazards and to remove themselves from 
such risks. (Y/N) 
Yes, several methods have been put in place to report work-
related hazards in accordance with ISO 45001, including 
safety patrols, risk assessments, and near-miss reporting, 
among others. 
Work-related hazards are reported using the respective 
formats to the plant EHS Officer, who in turn reports to the 
plant head and maintenance team.  
Corrective measures, if any, are then identified and 
implemented by the plant EHS and maintenance team. To 
mitigate 
work-related 
hazards, 
Sansera 
conducts 
emergency mock drills and awareness sessions to prepare 
its employees and workers.

previously; 
it 
is 
now 
actively 
monitored and reported to customers 
as required. 
2. Carbon reduction goals were initially 
not part of EHS objectives; these goals 
are now clearly defined and included. 
3. Treated effluent was not included in 
environmental aspects and hazard 
identification; it has since been 
incorporated into the assessment of 
aspects, 
impacts, 
hazards, 
risks, 
control measures, opportunities, and 
the magnitude of impacts. 
4. A grievance mechanism was not 
addressed before; a system is now 
available, 
managed 
by 
human 
resources and the management team. 
5. Smoke detectors have been provided 
in the goods storage area based on 
recommendations. 
6. First aid cases are now analysed to

2. Storage Protocols: Hazardous and 
non-hazardous waste are stored 
separately using the 3C method 
(covered, concrete, container). 
3. Record Maintenance: A quantity 
register is maintained for waste 
generation and disposal (Forms 3, 
8, and 10). 
4. Monitoring 
and 
Initiatives: 
Initiatives include recollection of 
cotton waste and used oil using a 
centrifugal pump, and reuse of 
plastic bins and cans. 
5. Adherence 
to 
Procedures: 
Following 
Environment 
Occupational Health and Safety 
Procedures 20, 23A, and 24. 
6. Reuse and Recycling: Plastic 
materials 
and 
discarded 
bins/cans are reused or sent to 
authorized vendors for recycling. 
7. E-waste and Hazardous Waste: E-
waste and hazardous waste are 
managed 
through 
authorized 
vendors.
