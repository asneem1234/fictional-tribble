Forward-looking statement
In this annual report, we have disclosed forward-looking information to 
enable investors comprehend our prospects and make informed investment 
decisions. This report and other statements – written and oral – that we 
periodically produce/publish, may contain forward-looking statements that set 
out anticipated results based on the management’s plans and assumptions. 
We have tried wherever possible to identify such statements by using words 
such as ‘anticipates’, ‘estimates’, ‘expects’, ‘projects’, ‘intends’, ‘plans’, 
‘believes’ and words of similar substance in connection with any discussion 
of future performance. We cannot guarantee that these forward-looking 
statements will be fully realised, although we believe we have been prudent in 
our assumptions. The achievement of results is subject to risks, uncertainties 
and even inaccurate assumptions. If known or unknown risks or uncertainties 
materialise, or if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could 
vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected. We undertake 
no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a

construction but also diversifies and 
enriches our project portfolio.
Railways and Metro- Expanding 
Our Horizons
As part of our long-term diversification 
strategy, we have been focusing on 
the railways and metro segments. I 
am pleased to announce that we are 
witnessing significant traction in this 
area. The government’s renewed focus 
on this sector, with an allocation of  
H 2.55 Lakh Crore, prioritises multi-
tracking corridors and station 
redevelopment. A significant portion 
of this budget is dedicated to multi-
tracking seven high-density corridors 
which is facilitating the expansion of 
rail networks by 10,959 kilometres 
in the next decade. This increased 
momentum creates ample scope for 
HG Infra, which is well-positioned with 
six ongoing railway projects across five 
states. We possess the requisite capital 
expenditure (CAPEX), technology and 
skilled workforce to contribute to network 
expansion, efficient development and 
modernisation of existing infrastructure.
Embracing Renewable Energy- 
A Strategic Move
The renewable energy sector is 
witnessing exponential growth, aiming 
for 450 gigawatts of installed capacity 
by 2030, with solar energy constituting 
over 60%. Recognising this lucrative 
potential, HGIEL has successfully 
secured solar power projects under 
the KUSUM scheme, totalling 543 
megawatts DC with an EPC value of  
H 1,307 Crore (excluding GST). We are 
actively exploring further opportunities 
in solar power development, including 
rooftop installations. These projects 
would solidify HGIEL position as 
a leading EPC company in the 
infrastructure sector.
Operational Highlights- 
Delivering Value
FY24 witnessed significant growth and 
diversification of our order book. As of 
March 31, 2024, it stands at a robust 
H 12,434 Crore, with Road & Highway 
EPC projects contributing 28%, Road 
and Highway HAM projects contributing 
40%, railway projects contributing 21%, 
and solar projects contributing 11%. Our 
ongoing EPC projects are progressing

Solar and Renewable Energy: 
A significant amount of money is being 
invested as a result of the Government’s 
aim to drive solar energy infrastructure. 
India has a combined renewable energy 
capacity of about 450GW by 2030. 
HG Infra has already bagged several 
solar power projects under the KUSUM 
scheme and is proactively looking at 
other opportunities as well.
Railways and Metro: 
The allocation for railways in the Union 
Budget is H 2.55 lac Crore with a focus 
on multitracking key corridors, station 
redevelopment and expanding the 
network by over ten thousand kilometres 
during the next decade.
Water Infrastructure: 
The expanded Budget allocation for 
the Jal Shakti Ministry demonstrates 
sustained investments in water 
infrastructure projects. HG Infra has 
also shown interest in initiatives such 
as Namami Gange while exploring 
opportunities in water desalination, 
wastewater treatment and rural/urban 
water supply projects.
This surge in infrastructure spending across various sectors presents abundant 
opportunities for our company. Our strategic approach, existing order book and

H.G. Infra Engineering Limited
Strategies shaping  
robust growth
We have successfully monetized 
three HAM projects in FY24 which is a 
significant development for this year. 
The deal, valued at 1.55x Price to Book 
involves HG completing the first tranche 
of the share purchase agreement by 
transferring 100% ownership of Gurgaon 
Sohna Highway Private Limited, H.G. 
Ateli Narnaul Highway Private Limited 
and H.G. Rewari Ateli Highway Private 
Limited to the Highways Infrastructure 
Trust for H 375.13 Crore. The final 
Tranche will be closed in FY25 with an 
achievable consideration of H 126 Crore.
Despite all-time low awarding by NHAI, 
we received several new HAM and EPC 
projects adding a significant value to our 
growing order book.
As we gear up for the next growth 
phase, we aim for 15% to 20% growth 
in revenue in the coming years while 
maintaining steady margins of 15% to 
16%. Our entry into the solar segment 
and focus on digital transformation, 
automation and strategic capex will drive 
sustainable growth. 
Additionally, we are strategically 
managing our equity requirements. The 
total equity requirement for 10 HAM 
projects is H 1,461 Crore out of which we 
have infused H 694 Crore in FY24 and  
H 459 Crore is estimated to be infused 
in FY25.
In FY23-24 ICRA reaffirmed / assigned 
AA- for long-term facilities, AA-/A1 for 
long-term/Short-term facility (NFB) and 
AA- for Non-Convertible Debentures 
(NCDs). Our rating was also upgraded 
from stable to positive. 
This upgrade shows our disciplined 
approach towards resilient financial 
growth. This improved financial 
standing enables us to fund new 
projects more efficiently, supporting our 
strategic expansion and diversification. 
Furthermore, a strong credit rating not 
only boost investor confidence but also 
contributes to our long-term growth 
story.

is complemented by our strategic 
partnerships with country’s top-tier 
suppliers of major materials like steel, 
cement, petroleum etc.
In our journey of growth, we are 
dedicated to maintaining high 
standards of corporate governance 
and ethical business practices ensuring 
that all decisions are supported by 
robust systems and procedures. Our 
commitment extends to leveraging 
advanced technology, including SAP 
Ariba, S/4HANA, DMS and ERP 
systems to enhance transparency, 
control and fair reporting. We are also 
actively integrating ESG (Environmental, 
Social, and Governance) principles into 
our operations focusing on sustainable 
practices and supply chain management 
to ensure responsible sourcing and 
minimise environmental impact.
Looking ahead
We are well-prepared for the company’s 
next growth phase and are confident 
that we will achieve our target revenue 
in the coming years. We aim to sustain 
a steady margin through business 
diversification, a skilled workforce, 
an innovative think tank team and 
advanced technology.
These strategic moves are poised 
to contribute significant value to our 
financial indicators, fostering a seamless 
and transparent real-time working 
environment and will truly help us in 
augmenting our operational efficiency 
and cost optimisation factor will 
positively impact on our bottom line. 
We can assure to all our internal and 
external stakeholders that we are 
committed to solidify our success 
footprints in this financial year.
Thank you for your continued support.

Management Discussion 
and Analysis
Economic overview
Global economy
In the fiscal year 2023, despite facing 
significant macroeconomic hurdles, the 
global economy showcased remarkable 
resilience, achieving a growth rate of 
3.2%. Challenges such as geopolitical 
tensions, fluctuating commodity prices, 
and 
elevated 
inflationary 
pressures 
persisted across both advanced and 
emerging markets. 
To combat escalating inflation, central 
banks in major economies implemented 
measured 
interest 
rate 
hikes. 
Consequently, inflation declined more 
rapidly than initially anticipated from 
its peak in 2022. This fostered gradual 
economic 
expansion 
and 
bolstered 
employment 
opportunities 
across 
the United States, Europe and other 
emerging markets.
However, sustained geopolitical unrest 
continued to disrupt global supply chains 
and trade dynamics. China's economic 
performance 
remained 
sluggish 
throughout 2023, a trend expected 
to persist into 2024. Given China's 
substantial manufacturing capacity and 
extensive supply networks, its struggles 
could negatively impact the global 
economy. Conversely, several emerging 
markets such as India, Vietnam and 
Mexico demonstrated robust growth 
trajectories, along with increasing capital 
inflows from foreign institutional investors.

Outlook
The easing of inflationary pressures and 
the adoption of more accommodating 
monetary policies by central banks 
are expected to favour the outlook. 
Projections 
indicate 
that 
the 
GDP 
growth rate will remain steady at 3.2% 
in CY 2024, maintaining this rate into 
CY 2025. Despite ongoing geopolitical 
tensions in Europe and West Asia, a 
cautious optimism persists. There is 
an anticipated gradual rebound and 
stabilisation of the global economy. The 
collective efforts by governments and the 
resilience demonstrated by economies 
worldwide will be instrumental in shaping 
a sustainable and inclusive growth 
trajectory in the years ahead.
Indian economy
Despite grappling with various global 
challenges, India maintained its position 
as one of the world's fastest-growing 
major economies in FY 2024. With a 
robust 
macroeconomic 
framework, 
burgeoning 
domestic 
demand, 
and 
prudent monetary policies implemented 
by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), 
India’s real GDP expanded by 8.2%. 
Headline inflation, as measured by the 
year-on-year changes in the all-India 
consumer price index (CPI), stabilised at 
5.4% in FY 2024
Merchandise 
exports 
experienced 
a seasonal upsurge in March 2024, 
coinciding with a peak in industrial 
production. The manufacturing sector 
emerged as a key driver of industrial 
growth, registering a steady 11.6% 
increase throughout FY 2024. Notably, 
enhanced capacity utilisation across 
manufacturing 
propelled 
economic 
expansion further. 
Despite the declining inflation rates and 
increased credit demand, an atmosphere 
of 
economic 
optimism 
prevailed. 
Efforts to streamline supply chains and 
increased 
government 
expenditure 
shielded India from significant economic 
disruptions. India is increasingly viewed 
as a viable alternative to China and is 
projected to become the world's third-
largest economy by 2027. 
Outlook
The Indian economy remains optimistic, 
supported 
by 
strong 
fundamentals 
such as political stability, heightened 
government focus on public capital 
expenditure, a gradual rise in private 
capital expenditure and growing credit 
demand.

Industry overview
Road and highway infrastructure of 
India
India has one of the largest road networks 
in the world, spanning approximately 
66.71 lakh kilometres and comprising 
national highways, state highways and 
rural roads. This extensive network 
is vital to the country's economic and 
social development, ensuring efficient 
transportation and connectivity across 
diverse 
regions. 
Although 
national 
highways make up only about 2% of the 
total road network, they handle over 40% 
of the traffic, highlighting their significance 
in the national infrastructure.3
2nd largest road network in the world
The construction of national highways has 
significantly accelerated, with a notable 
increase in the pace of development. By 
the end of 2023, the National Highways 
Authority of India (NHAI) had expanded 
the national highway network by 60% 
from its 2014 baseline, reaching 1,46,145 
kilometres. This rapid expansion is part 
of the government's broader initiative to 
enhance infrastructure, with the NHAI 
playing a pivotal role in implementing key 
projects like the Bharat mala Pariyojana, 
which aims to develop and enhance about

Foreign 
Direct 
Investment 
(FDI) 
has been instrumental in driving the 
growth of India's railway sector. These 
investments have facilitated numerous 
projects, including the introduction of 
high-speed trains, track modernisation 
and the enhancement of safety and 
signalling systems. The government’s 
decision to allow 100% FDI in the 
railway sector, has paved the way for 
increased international partnerships and 
technological advancements.
Looking ahead, the outlook for India's 
railway infrastructure is robust, driven 
by ambitious government initiatives and 
significant capital inflows. The National 
Rail Plan aims to dramatically expand 
and upgrade the network by 2030, 
focusing on high-speed rail corridors, 
electrification and the development of 
dedicated freight corridors to enhance 
logistical efficiency. The plan includes 
the procurement of 400 Vande Bharat 
trains, and the redevelopment of over 
1,300 stations, which are expected to 
significantly transform the passenger 
experience.11 The Ministry of Railways 
plans to expand the Vande Bharat train 
fleet, 
introduce 
hydrogen-powered 
trains, lay new tracks, and complete 
the Ahmedabad-Mumbai bullet train 
project. The Vande Bharat Express will 
continue to be a key focus. In addition 
to the Perambur Integral Coach Factory, 
production of the Vande Bharat Express 
will now also occur at three more 
factories in Sonepat (Haryana), Latur 
(Maharashtra), and Raebareli (UP).
These developments will enable the 
railway sector to provide enhanced 
passenger services and increased freight 
handling capacity meeting the demands 
of a growing economy.
Railway infrastructure of India
India's railway infrastructure remains a 
cornerstone of its transportation sector, 
characterised by extensive growth and 
strategic enhancements. The Indian 
Railways, one of the world's largest 
rail networks, has achieved significant 
milestones in expanding its track length, 
with 5,100 km of track laid during the 
fiscal year 2023-24, averaging more 
than 14 Km per day.8 This expansion 
is part of a broader effort to modernise 
and improve the railway's efficiency and 
connectivity across the country. As of 
Feb 2024, 61,813 km of Broad-Gauge 
network has been electrified.9  
The government's commitment to this 
sector is underscored by substantial 
financial contribution, with a record 
budgetary allocation of ₹2.55 lakh 
crore for the fiscal year 2024-25. This 
represents a 5.8% increase over the 
previous year aimed at further developing 
and modernising railway infrastructure.10 
The infrastructure sector plays a key role 
in driving India's economic expansion 
and 
holistic 
development. 
As 
the 
country progresses toward becoming 
a global economic powerhouse, the 
need for robust infrastructure becomes 
increasingly apparent. Partnerships with 
the private sector have emerged as 
pivotal in this pursuit, bringing essential 
investment, innovation and efficiency. The 
synergy between governmental bodies 
and private enterprises is vital in crafting 
resilient, forward-looking infrastructure 
that paves the way for a prosperous and 
sustainable future for every Indian citizen. 
The Central Government significantly 
increased its capital expenditure in the 
past two budgets, with capital outlay 
rising from INR 4.1 trillion in FY2021 to 
INR 10.0 trillion in FY2024.##
The infrastructure sector remains a focal 
point for capital expenditure, primarily 
driven by investments in roads, bridges, 
and the power sector, reflecting the 
government’s 
strong 
emphasis 
on 
infrastructure development. Structural 
reforms such as the Goods and Services 
Tax (GST), Insolvency and Bankruptcy 
Code 
(IBC), 
digitization 
initiatives, 
corporate tax rationalization, and labor 
law reforms have further bolstered the 
investment landscape.
Historically, during election years, state 
governments tend to accelerate the 
completion of infrastructure projects and 
inject additional funds into the economy. 
Therefore, there is a strong likelihood that a 
plethora of new infrastructure projects will be 
announced in the coming twelve months, 
alongside the completion of ongoing ones. 
This presents a significant opportunity for 
infrastructure and construction companies 
operating in India. ##

India as a global hub for green hydrogen 
production and export, targeting at 
least 5 million metric tons per year by 
2030.15 This ambitious target is backed 
by an estimated investment of ₹8 trillion 
(approximately $100 billion).**
The 
government's 
comprehensive 
strategy includes incentives worth $2.3 
billion under the SIGHT programme to 
stimulate green hydrogen production 
and electrolyser manufacturing.16 These 
efforts are complemented by policy 
measures designed to reduce the cost of 
green hydrogen and promote its adoption 
across 
various 
sectors, 
including 
transportation and industry, positioning 
green hydrogen as a key drive of India's

largest in the world. Significant expansions 
are underway, with an additional 919 
kilometres of metro lines under construction. 
This rapid development is part of the 
broader National Urban Transport Policy, 
which aims to establish metro systems 
in cities with populations exceeding two 
million. This reflects the government's 
commitment 
to 
enhancing 
urban 
transportation and reducing congestion.12 
Renewable energy sector of India
Solar power
India's solar power sector continues to 
shine brightly as a cornerstone of the 
country's renewable energy strategy. 
With an installed capacity that has 
increased by 30 times in the last nine 
years, reaching 82.63 GW as of April 
2024. India stands as a global leader in 
solar energy.13 This remarkable growth is 
underpinned by supportive government 
policies, including the ambitious target of 
achieving 500 GW of renewable energy 
capacity by 2030, of which solar energy 
is a significant contributor.14  
Key government initiatives, such as 
the National Solar Mission and the 
Production 
Linked 
Incentive 
(PLI) 
scheme for solar PV manufacturing, have 
played pivotal roles in accelerating solar 
power development.  the suspension of 
the ALMM order to encourage the use 
of cost-effective modules has further 
bolstered 
this

Furthermore, 
the strategic focus on developing solar 
cities and parks, and the push towards 
floating PV projects, highlight India's 
innovative approach to maximizing its 
solar potential. India’s solar energy 
sector is rapidly expanding, driven by 
vast potential and robust policy support. 
With an extraordinary solar potential of 
5,000 trillion kWh per year, the country 
has significant renewable resources. 
As of February 2024, India’s installed 
solar capacity reached 75.6 GW, with 
an ambitious target of 200 GW by FY 
2028. Approximately 85% of this capacity 
comes 
from 
utility-scale 
projects, 
ensuring efficiency and cost reduction. 
The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) 
scheme is pivotal in boosting India’s 
solar manufacturing capabilities. *The 
Indian government has an ambitious plan 
to achieve 500 GW of clean energy by 
CY2030 out of which 300 GW will come 
from solar. Based on recent government 
announcements, it is projected that 
697 km Metro Rail 
network added in 10 
years.
The government continues to support 
the expansion of the metro rail network 
through substantial financial investments, 
including a notable allocation in the Union 
Budget 2024-25. The metro construction 
sector presents a substantial opportunity, 
with projects valued at over USD 46.5 
billion in various stages of planning, 
approval, tendering, financial closure, 
and construction 
Key projects such as the expansion of the 
Delhi Metro and the introduction of new 
metro lines in cities like Pune and Kolkata 
are set to further enhance connectivity. 
The Metro Rail Policy of 2017 and 
initiatives like the PM Gati Shakti 
plan are instrumental in driving these 
developments. These initiatives aim to 
integrate various modes of transport and 
improve the overall efficiency of urban 
transit systems in India.

National Rail Plan Vision 2030
The National Rail Plan (NRP) 2030 for 
India aims to create a "future ready" 
railway system by 2030. The primary 
objective of the NRP is to proactively 
create capacity ahead of demand. It 
seeks to formulate strategies based on 
operational capacities and commercial 
policy initiatives to increase modal share 
of the Railways in freight to 45%.
The National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) 
has allocated a cumulative H 13.67 trillion 
to railway projects from FY20 to FY25, 
aiming to enhance passenger and freight 
transport efficiency. 
Gati Shakti Master Plan
This initiative aims to integrate the 
planning and execution of infrastructure 
projects across multiple sectors including 
roads, railways, airports and ports with 
a holistic vision. The goal is to enhance 
multi-modal connectivity and logistics 
efficiency, ultimately reducing the cost of 
goods and services.
National 
Infrastructure 
Pipeline 
(NIP)
It is a five-year programme in India aimed 
at enhancing the quality of life for citizens 
by constructing world-class infrastructure 
across the country. With as initial 
sanctioned amount of ₹102 lakh crore 
and aims to attract both domestic and 
foreign investments into infrastructure 
projects. The NIP is considered crucial 
for India to achieve its goal of becoming 
a $5 trillion economy by 2025.19

Growth drivers
Government initiatives and budget 
allocations
Significant government funding and 
strategic initiatives like the Bharatmala 
Pariyojana and the Gati Shakti Master 
Plan serve as major catalysts for driving 
progress. These projects are geared 
towards enhancing road connectivity and 
infrastructure across the country, with 
substantial budget allocations ensuring 
continued expansion and upgrades.
Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs)
The encouragement of PPP models 
in road construction and maintenance 
projects allows for more efficient capital 
utilization and innovation in construction 
practices, thereby stimulating growth 
in this sector.
Increased motor vehicle penetration
As vehicle penetration increases in 
India, the demand for improved and 
more extensive road networks grows, 
driving 
further 
development 
in 
the 
highway sector.
High-speed and dedicated freight 
corridors
The 
development 
of 
high-speed 
passenger corridors and dedicated freight 
corridors aims to reduce travel time and 
enhance cargo capacity representing 
another significant growth area within the 
railway sector.
Growing focus on renewable energy 
inclusion
India’s ambitious targets for renewable 
energy expansion, including specific 
goals for solar energy and green 
hydrogen production, are backed by 
supportive 
policies 
and 
incentives. 
Initiatives such as the Production Linked 
Incentive (PLI) scheme for solar PV 
manufacturers and the National Green 
Hydrogen Mission play a crucial role 
in this endeavour. Diversifying energy 
sources to include renewables not 
only enhances energy security but also 
reduces dependence on imported fossil 
fuels, further driving growth.

the remuneration of each Director to the median remuneration of the employees of the Company for the financial year is 
provided in the above table.
	
3.	
The percentage increase in the median remuneration of employees in the financial year: 
	
	
In the financial year, there was an increase of 70.17% in the median remuneration of employees.

hiring of such operating staff category on the role of the Company is to create a sense of accountability and belongingness 
of such cadre employees in the organization as they are the breadwinners at the project level, while 22.10% increase in 
total gross salary of managerial personnel during the financial year as compared to the previous year due to the Company’s 
growth in the financial year 2023-24.

Climate 
change
R/O
Risk -. HGIEL’s projects are 
located 
in 
India 
while 
the 
country is experiencing more 
frequent extreme weather events 
attributable to climate change.
Opportunity – Climate Action 
motivates 
the 
Company 
to 
contribute to this global issue 
positively by adapting climate-
resilient 
infrastructure 
and 
resource-efficient technologies.
The 
company 
is 
adopting 
measures related to resource 
efficiency, waste minimization, 
and 
carbon 
reduction 
to 
minimize the impacts of climate 
change by regularly tracking its 
environmental footprints.
To implement these measures, 
HGIEL has imparted trainings to 
sensitize all the employees on 
climate change and its impact on 
businesses.

GHG,Air 
Emission 
and 
Renewable 
Energy
R/O
Risk 
– 
Construction 
and 
infrastructure sectors are one of 
the highest contributors to carbon 
emissions, 
significantly 
driving 
climate change.
Opportunity 
– 
Reduction 
in 
emissions provides recognition to 
the company among its peers and 
stakeholders.
Availability of Renewable energy 
has significantly increased, many 
projects and lower tariffs, hence it 
will be cost advantage to HGIEL. 
Shifting to RE helps combat 
climate change risks.
The 
company 
shall 
improve 
its environmental footprint by 
fostering innovation in the space 
of energy.
Investors seek companies with 
less carbon footprint.
The company will gradually move 
towards 
adopting 
renewable 
sources of energy, such as solar-
powered electrical appliances, 
in its corporate offices and site 
offices.
P/N
3
Biodiversity 
& Land Use
R
Since the Company is involved 
in the construction of roads and 
highways, loss of local biodiversity 
due to land clearance and change 
in land use along the highway 
post-construction is an associated 
risk.
There are regulatory compliance 
requirements as well as potential 
social concerns on account of 
damage to natural habitats for the 
local flora and fauna.
Availability 
of 
the 
necessary 
clearances 
with 
the 
project 
developer is important to avoid 
delays/disruption.
Company 
monitors 
that 
all 
regulatory 
approvals 
by 
the 
forest and wild life department 
are obtained by the project 
developer, 
and 
reviews 
compliance periodically.
The company has incorporated 
the 
mission 
of 
biodiversity 
enhancement as its CSR strategy 
and has successfully planted 
1,00,000 trees this financial year.

Water, waste 
& hazardous 
material 
management
R/O
Risk—The construction business 
requires 
water 
from 
various 
sources and generates waste, 
such 
as 
hazardous 
waste, 
construction and demolition, etc. 
Ineffective waste management 
practices 
and 
unaccountable 
water consumption might result 
in non-compliance with legal rules 
and lead to adverse environmental 
impacts.
Opportunity—The 
company 
can adapt the 3 R concept of 
reduce, reuse, and recycle, which 
will contribute to environmental 
conservation.
The company has adopted an 
integrated waste management 
plan.
With 
respect 
to 
water 
conservation following actions 
are taken by the Company:
Company 
has 
designed 
a 
drainage 
system 
for 
the 
construction camps at the project 
sites to collect wastewater and 
stormwater.
The company has also installed 
sewage treatment plants (STPs) 
at project sites.

batching plant and landscaping 
development at the construction 
camp.

fines/ penalties which will lead to 
reputational risk.
The company has a dedicated 
Compliance Team to look after all 
the compliances.

Sustainable 
supply chain
R/O
Risk and Opportunity - Procuring 
goods 
and 
services 
from 
a 
sustainable value chain fulfils the 
organization’s overall commitment 
towards 
sustainability 
and 
dependencies across the entire 
life cycle of a product or service.
The company has developed 
a Sustainable Sourcing Policy 
and Supplier Code of Conduct 
which

Labour 
standards 
& working 
conditions
R
Poor

and 
practices/ conditions might result 
in health & safety issues and 
also attract fines/ penalties/ court 
cases and eventually lead to 
reputational risk.
No instances of unethical labour 
practices have been reported 
as a result of the successful 
implementation of the Company’s 
policy on employment rights and 
standard practices. This policy

Anti-
corruption & 
anti-bribery
R
A reported instance of anti-
corruption and anti-bribery results 
in damage to the brand and a 
downfall in share price. It may also 
lead to exclusion from potential 
business opportunities and liability 
to pay hefty fines.
The company has developed 
and implemented the ABC Policy. 
Whistle 
Blower 
Mechanism 
has also been adopted by the 
Company.
Effective 
implementation 
of 
ABC policy is not only a risk-
preventative or remedial measure 
but can also help businesses 
combat any regulatory risk.

Occupational 
health & 
safety
R
HGIEL is into the construction 
business which is labour intensive 
and poor occupational health and 
safety (OHS) performance directly 
affects labour costs by lowering 
productivity. Furthermore, it can 
harm the Company’s brand and 
raise operating costs through 
penalties and other contingent 
liabilities.
The company has adopted and 
implemented the following risk

management and diversity may 
decrease productivity within the 
organization.

employee 
morale and attract fines/penalties, 
leading to reputational risk.
Opportunity – DEI and workforce 
management help in booming 
the work culture of the company, 
which increases productivity.
With the effective implementation 
of

Independent Auditor’s Report
To the Members of H.G. Infra Engineering Limited
Report on the Audit of the Standalone Financial 
Statements
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial 
statements of H.G. Infra Engineering Limited (“the Company”), 
which includes two jointly controlled operations consolidated 
on a proportionate basis (Refer Note 51 to standalone financial 
statements), which comprise the Standalone Balance Sheet 
as at March 31, 2024, the Standalone Statement of Profit and 
Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Standalone 
Statement of Changes in Equity and Standalone Statement of 
Cash Flows for the year then ended, and notes to the standalone 
financial statements, including material accounting policies and 
other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as the 
“standalone financial statements”).
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to 
the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial 
statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 
2013 (“the Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and 
fair view in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards 
prescribed under Section 133 of the Act read with Companies 
(Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended (“Ind 
AS”) and other accounting principles generally accepted in 
India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 
2024, and its total comprehensive income (comprising of profit 
and other comprehensive income), its changes in equity and its 
cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements 
in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified 
under Section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under 
those Standards are further described in the ‘Auditor’s 
Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial 
statements’ section of our report. We are independent of the 
Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”) together with 
the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act 
and the Rules thereunder and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the 
Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence obtained by 
us and the audit evidence obtained by other auditors in terms 
of their reports referred to in “Other Matters” paragraph below, 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the 
standalone financial statements for the year ended March 31, 
2024. These matters were addressed in the context of our 
audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in 
forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate 
opinion on these matters.
Key Audit Matter
Our audit procedures in respect of this area included the 
following:
1.	 Estimation of contract cost and revenue recognition. (Refer to Note 
1 (iv) (i), 2 (c), 29 and 52) of the Standalone Financial Statements)
	
Revenue from construction contracts is recognised over a 
period of time in accordance with the requirements of Ind AS 
115 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’. The contract 
revenue amounts to H 50,695.19 million for engineering, 
procurement and construction contracts, which usually 
extends over a period of 2-3 years, and the contract prices 
are fixed and, in few cases, subject to clauses with price 
variances and variable consideration.
	
In accordance with Input method prescribed under Ind AS 
115 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’, the contract 
revenue is measured based on the proportion of contract costs 
incurred for work performed to date relative to the estimated 
total costs. This method requires the Company to perform an 
initial assessment of total estimated cost and reassess the 
total construction cost at the end of each reporting period to 
determine the appropriate percentage of completion.
i.	
Evaluated the accounting policy for revenue recognition and 
assessed compliance of the policy with the principles enunciated 
under Ind AS 115 - ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customer’.
ii.	 Understood and evaluated the design and implementation 
and tested the operating effectiveness of key internal financial 
controls, including those related to review and approval of 
estimated costs and review of provision for foreseeable losses, 
if any, by the authorised representatives.
iii.	 We obtained the revenue workings (percentage of completion 
calculations) from the Company’s management, for all contracts, 
containing actual costs incurred, estimated costs (comprising 
of actual costs and remaining costs to completion), estimated 
contract revenue and actual revenues recognised during the 
year based on proportion of actual costs to estimated costs. 
For sample of contracts, we agreed contract revenue with key 
contractual terms, agreed actual costs with system generated 
reports and agreed estimated costs with costs sheets for 
individual contracts approved by the authorised representatives. 
167
Annual Report 2023-24
Financial Statements
Key Audit Matter
Our audit procedures in respect of this area included the 
following:
	
The estimation of total cost to complete the contract involves 
significant judgement and estimation throughout the period of 
contract, as it is subject to revision as the contract progresses - based 
on latest available information including physical work done on the 
ground, changes in cost estimates and need to accrue provision for 
onerous contracts, if any. Besides recognition of revenues based on 
actual costs and estimated costs to complete the work, at the period 
end, the measurement and recognition of contract assets (unbilled 
revenue) and contract liabilities (unearned revenue) related to each of 
the contracts is also dependent on cost estimates.
	
In view of above, we have considered the estimation of construction 
contract costs as a key audit matter.
	
Reperformed the calculation of revenues during the year using 
proportion of actual costs to estimated costs and compared 
the results with workings provided by the Company.
iv.	 For actual costs incurred during FY 2023-24, we tested the 
samples to appropriate supporting documents.
v.	 To validate the remaining costs to completion, for sample 
contracts, we obtained the approved costs sheets (for each 
of such sample contracts) containing the breakdown of such 
costs. Evaluated the reasonableness of management’s 
judgements and assumptions through comparison of actual 
margins during the year with base margins estimated at 
the beginning, comparison between financial progress 
(proportion of actual costs to estimated costs) and physical 
progress certified by the Independent Engineer, past trends 
of recovery of price escalation with incremental costs incurred 
and  comparison of actual costs within similar contracts.
vi.	 Assessed the adequacy and appropriateness of the 
disclosures made in standalone financial statements in 
compliance with the requirements of Ind AS 115 ‘Revenue 
from Contracts with Customers’.
2.	 Valuation of accounts receivable and contract assets in view of 
risk of credit losses. (Refer Note 1 (ix), 39(i), 7, 11 and 15 – Trade 
Receivables and Note 16(a) for contract asset to Standalone 
Financial Statements)
	
Accounts receivable and Contract assets are significant items in 
the Company’s standalone financial statements aggregating to H 
19,725.29 million as of March 31, 2024 and provision for impairment 
of receivables and contract assets amounted to H 571.99 millions 
as at March 31, 2024. The Company has a concentration of credit 
exposure on certain customers, which include government and private 
organisations, where there are delays in collections due to various 
reasons.
	
The management periodically assess the adequacy of provisions 
recognised, as applicable, on receivables and contract assets, based 
on factors such as credit risk of the customer, status of the project, 
discussions with the customers and underlying contractual terms and 
conditions. This involves significant judgement.
	
Given the relative significance of these receivables and contract assets 
to the standalone financial statements and the nature and extent of 
audit procedures involved to assess the recoverability of receivables 
and contract assets, we determined this to be a key audit matter.
i.	
Understood and evaluated the design and tested the 
operating effectiveness of key internal financial controls in 
relation to determination of expected credit loss.
ii.	 Obtained confirmation from parties, for sample balances, with 
respect to outstanding balances. Wherever confirmations are 
not received for the samples, performed alternate procedures 
through verification of Company’s invoices approved by the 
respective customers which represents acknowledgement of 
work delivered.
iii.	 Performed inquiry procedures with senior management of the 
Company regarding status of collectability of the receivable 
and contract assets.
iv.	 In respect of material contract balances, corroborated our 
inquiry procedures with the correspondence between the 
Company and the customers, contracts and other documents.
v.	 Assessed the inputs used by the Management to determine 
the amount of allowances by considering factors such as 
credit risk of the customer, cash collections, past history and 
status of the project, and correspondence with customers.
vi.	 Presented the results of our work done to the audit committee.
vii.	 Assessed the adequacy and appropriateness of the 
disclosures made in the standalone financial statements in 
this regard.

Information Other than the Standalone Financial 
Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon
The Company’s Management and Board of Directors are 
responsible for the other information. The other information 
comprises the information included in the annual report, but 
does not include the financial statements and auditor’s report 
thereon. The annual report is expected to be made available to 
us after the date of this auditor’s report.
Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not 
cover the other information and we will not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the standalone financial statements, 
our responsibility is to read the other information identified 
above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider 
whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the 
standalone financial statements or our knowledge obtained in 
the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
When we read the annual report, if we conclude that there is a 
material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate 
the matter to those charged with governance and describe 
actions applicable under the applicable laws and regulations.
Responsibilities of Management and Board of 
Directors for the standalone financial statements
The Company’s Management and Board of Directors are 
responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act 
with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial 
statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, 
financial performance and other comprehensive income, 
changes in equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance 
with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, 
including the Indian Accounting Standards (“IND AS”) specified 
under Section 133 of the Act. This responsibility also includes 
maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance 
with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of 
the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other 
irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting 
policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance 
of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating 
effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the 
accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation 
of the standalone financial statement that give a true and fair 
view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error.
In 
preparing 
the 
standalone 
financial 
statements, 
the 
Management and Board of Directors are responsible for 
assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and 
using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board 
of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease 
operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The Board 
of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company’s 
financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
standalone financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the standalone financial statements as a whole are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to 
issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee 
that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always 
detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements 
can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, 
individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on 
the basis of these standalone financial statements.
We give in “Annexure A” a detailed description of Auditor’s 
responsibilities for Audit of the standalone financial statements.
Other Matter
1.	
We did not audit the Company’s share in two jointly 
controlled operations included in the standalone financial 
statements of the Company, which reflects total assets of 
H 2.36 millions as at March 31, 2024, and total revenues of 
H 11.36 millions, total net profit after tax of H (0.05) million and 
total comprehensive income of H (0.05) million for the year 
ended March 31, 2024, and cash outflows (net) of H (0.05) 
million for the year then ended. The financial statements 
of these jointly controlled operations have been audited by 
other auditors whose reports have been furnished to us 
by the Management, and our opinion on the standalone 
financial statements (including other information) in so far 
relates to the amounts and disclosures included in respect 
of these Jointly controlled operations, is based solely on 
the report of other auditors.
	
Our opinion is not modified in respect of the above matter 
with respect to our reliance on the work done and the 
reports of the other auditors.

of accounts. While the accounting software 
has a feature of recording audit trail (edit log) 
facility and same has been operated throughout 
the year for all relevant transactions, we were 
not able to verify this aspect in SAAS based 
applications as no underlying evidence, related

manage these applications.

Annexure A to the Independent Auditor’s Report on even date on 
the Standalone Financial Statements of H.G. Infra Engineering Limited
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
standalone financial statements
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:
•	
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of 
the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud 
or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive 
to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The 
risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting 
from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as 
fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
•	
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to 
the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)
(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our 
opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal 
financial controls with reference to standalone financial 
statements in place and the operating effectiveness 
of such controls.
•	
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates 
and related disclosures made by management and 
Board of Directors.
•	
Conclude on the appropriateness of Management and Board 
of Director’s use of the going concern basis of accounting 
and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a 
material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions 
that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material 
uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our 
auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the standalone 
financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, 
to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the 
audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s 
report. However, future events or conditions may cause the 
Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
•	
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content 
of the standalone financial statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the standalone financial 
statements represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, 
among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the 
audit and significant audit findings, including any significant 
deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement 
that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements 
regarding independence, and to communicate with them 
all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be 
thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, 
related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the standalone financial statements 
for the year ended March 31, 2024 and are therefore, the 
key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s 
report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure 
about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we 
determine that a matter should not be communicated in our 
report because the adverse consequences of doing so would 
reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits 
of such communication.

which have fallen due, during the year, have not been

to standalone financial statements of H.G. Infra Engineering

In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, an 
adequate internal financial controls with reference to standalone 
financial statements and such internal financial controls with 
reference to standalone financial statements were operating 
effectively as at March 31, 2024 based on the internal control 
with reference to standalone financial statements criteria 
established by the Company considering the essential 
components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on 
Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting 
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) 
(the “Guidance Note”).
Managements’ Responsibility for Internal Financial 
Controls
The Company’s Management is responsible for establishing 
and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal 
control with reference to standalone financial statements 
criteria established by the Company considering the essential 
components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note. 
These responsibilities include the design, implementation and 
maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were 
operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient 
conduct of its business, including adherence to Company’s 
policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and 
detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness 
of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable 
financial information, as required under the Act.
Auditors’ Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's 
internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial 
statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in 
accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards on 
Auditing, issued by ICAI and deemed to be prescribed under 
Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of 
internal financial controls. Those Standards and the Guidance 
Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan 
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to

and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls 
with reference to standalone financial statements and their 
operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls 
with reference to standalone financial statements included 
obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with 
reference to standalone financial statements, assessing the 
risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating 
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based 
on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the 
auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of 
material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, 
whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on 
the Company’s internal financial controls with reference to 
standalone financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls With 
reference to Standalone Financial Statements
A Company's internal financial control with reference to 
standalone financial statements is a process designed to provide 
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial 
reporting and the preparation of standalone financial statements 
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles. A Company's internal financial control 
with reference to standalone financial statements includes those 
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of 
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect 
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded 
as necessary to permit preparation of standalone financial 
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company 
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of 
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide 
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection 
of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's 
assets that could have a material effect on the standalone 
financial statements.

H.G. Infra Engineering Limited
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls 
With reference to Standalone financial statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls 
with reference to standalone financial statements, including the 
possibility of collusion or improper management override of 
controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur 
and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the 
internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial 
statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the 
internal financial control with reference to standalone financial 
statements may become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or 
procedures may deteriorate.
Other Matter
Reporting under Section 143 (3) (i) of the Act in respect of the 
adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference to the 
standalone financial statements is not applicable to two jointly 
controlled operations.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter

H.G. Infra Engineering Limited
Notes forming part of the Standalone Financial Statements
as of and for the year ended March 31, 2024
Background
H.G. Infra Engineering Limited ("the Company") is a Public Limited Company listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange and National 
Stock Exchange on March 9, 2018. Its registered office is at 14, Panchwati Colony, Ratanada, Jodhpur – 342001, Rajasthan, India.
The Company is engaged in the business of Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC), Maintenance of roads, bridges, 
flyovers and other infrastructure contract works.
These Standalone financial statements were reviewed by the Audit Committee and authorized to be issued by the Board of Directors 
on May 08, 2024.
(a)	 Basis of preparation
	
(i)	
Compliance with Ind AS
	
	
The Standalone financial statements of the Company comply in all material aspects with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind 
AS) notified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (the Act) read with Rule 4 of the Companies (Indian Accounting 
Standards) Rules, 2015 and other relevant provisions of the Act.
	
(ii)	
Historical cost convention
	
	
The Standalone financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the following:
 
 
Certain financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value;
 
 
Assets held for sale – measured of fair value less cost of sell and
 
 
Defined benefit plans - plan assets measured at fair value
	
(iii)	 New and amended standards adopted by the Company
 
 
The Ministry of Corporate Affairs ("MCA") has notified Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 
2023 dated March 31, 2023 to amend the following Ind AS which are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 
April 01, 2023. The Company has applied these amendments for the first-time in these standalone financial statements.
 
 
Amendments to Ind AS 1 - Disclosure of accounting policies: The amendments aim to help entities provide accounting 
policy disclosures that are more useful by replacing the requirement for entities to disclose their ‘significant’ accounting 
policies with a requirement to disclose their ‘material’ accounting policies and adding guidance on how entities apply 
the concept of materiality in making decisions about accounting policy disclosures. The amendments have an impact 
on the disclosures of accounting policies, but not on the measurement, recognition or presentation of any items in the 
standalone financial statements.
 
 
Amendments to Ind AS 8 - Definition of accounting estimates: The amendments clarify the distinction between 
changes in accounting estimates and changes in accounting policies and the correction of errors. It has also been 
clarified how entities use measurement techniques and inputs to develop accounting estimates. The amendments 
had no impact on the standalone financial statements.
 
 
Amendments to Ind AS 12 - Deferred tax related to assets and liabilities arising from a single transaction: The 
amendments narrow the scope of the initial recognition exception under Ind AS 12, so that it no longer applies to 
transactions that give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences such as leases. This amendment 
does not have any material impact on the standalone financial statements.
	
(iv)	 New Standards (including amendments) issued but not yet effective
	
	
MCA notifies new standards or amendments to existing standards under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 
Rules as issued from time to time. During the year ended March 31, 2024, MCA has not notified any new standards or 
amendments to the existing standards applicable to the Company.

Financial Statements
Notes forming part of the Standalone Financial Statements
as of and for the year ended March 31, 2024
(b)	 Operating Cycle
	
The Company classifies an asset as current when:
	
-	
it expects to realise the asset or intends to sell or consume it in normal operating cycle
	
-	
it holds the asset primarily for the purpose of trading
	
-	
it expects to realise the asset within twelve months after the reporting period or
	
-	
the asset is cash or cash equivalent unless the asset is restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at 
least twelve months after the reporting period.
	
All other assets are classified as non-current.
	
The Company classifies a liability as current when:
	
-	
it expects to settle the liability in its normal operating cycle
	
-	
it holds the liability primarily for the purpose of trading
	
-	
the liability is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period, or
	
-	
there is no unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period. Terms 
of a liability that could, at the option of the counterparty, result in its settlement by the issue of equity instruments do not 
affect its classification.
	
All other liabilities are classified as non-current.
	
Operating cycle
	
Operating cycle is the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realization in cash or cash equivalents.
	
Based on the nature of operations and the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realization in cash 
or cash equivalents, the Company has ascertained its operating cycle as twelve months for the purpose of current, non current 
classification of assets and liabilities.
	
1	
Material Accounting Policies
	
	
Pursuant to the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2023 effective 01-04-2023, the company 
is required to disclose ‘material accounting policy Information’ in lieu of the earlier requirement of disclosing ‘significant 
accounting policies’.
	
	
This note provides a list of the material accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these Standalone financial 
statements. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
	
	
i.	
Joint control operation
	
	
	
The Company recognises its direct right to the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of joint operations and its 
share of any jointly held or incurred assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. These have been incorporated in the 
Standalone financial statements under the appropriate headings. Details of the joint operation are set out in note 51.
	
	
ii.	
Segment reporting
	
	
	
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating 
decision maker (CODM). The Managing Director of the Company has been identified as CODM and he assesses 
the financial performance and position of the Company, and makes strategic decisions. Refer note 41 for 
segment information.

Notes forming part of the Standalone Financial Statements
as of and for the year ended March 31, 2024
	
	
iii.	
Foreign currency translation
	
	
	
(i)	
Functional and presentation currency
	
	
	
	
Items included in the Standalone financial statements of the entity are measured using the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which the entity operates (`the functional currency'). The Standalone financial 
statements are presented in Indian rupee, which is Companies functional and presentation currency.
	
	
	
(ii)	
Transactions and balances
	
	
	
	
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates at the dates 
of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and 
from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at year end exchange 
rates are generally recognized in Standalone Statement of profit and loss.
	
	
iv.	
Revenue recognition
	
	
	
The Company derives revenue principally from following streams:
 
 
Construction contracts
 
 
Sale of Services (Operation and Maintenance contracts)
	
	
	
(i)	
Construction contracts
	
	
	
	
The Company recognises revenue from engineering, procurement and construction contracts (‘EPC’) over the 
period of time, as performance obligations are satisfied over time due to continuous transfer of control to the 
customer. EPC contracts are generally accounted for as a single performance obligation as it involves complex 
integration of goods and services.
	
	
	
	
The performance obligations are satisfied over time as the work progresses. The Company recognises revenue 
using input method (i.e percentage-of-completion method), based primarily on contract cost incurred to date 
compared to total estimated contract costs. Changes to total estimated contract costs, if any, are recognised in 
the period in which they are determined as assessed at the contract level. If the consideration in the contract 
includes price variation clause or there are amendments in contracts, the Company estimates the amount of 
consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for work performed.
	
	
	
	
Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of the performance obligations, the estimation 
of total revenue and cost of completion is complex, subject to many variables and requires significant judgment. 
Variability in the transaction price arises primarily due to liquidated damages, price variation clauses, changes 
in scope, incentives, if any. The Company considers its experience with similar transactions and expectations 
regarding the contract in estimating the amount of variable consideration to which it will be entitled and 
determining whether the estimated variable consideration should be constrained. The Company includes 
estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative 
revenue recognised will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. 
The estimates of variable consideration are based largely on an assessment of anticipated performance and all 
information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available.
	
	
	
	
Progress billings are generally issued upon completion of certain phases of the work as stipulated in the contract. 
Billing terms of the over-time contracts vary but are generally based on achieving specified milestones. The 
difference between the timing of revenue recognised and customer billings result in changes to contract assets 
and contract liabilities. Payment is generally due upon receipt of the invoice, payable within 90 days or less. 
Contractual retention amounts billed to customers are generally due upon expiration of the contract period.
	
	
	
	
The contracts generally result in revenue recognised in excess of billings which are presented as contract assets 
on the statement of financial position. Amounts billed and due from customers are classified as receivables on

as of and for the year ended March 31, 2024
the statement of financial position. The portion of the payments retained by the customer until final contract 
settlement is not considered a significant financing component since it is usually intended to provide customer 
with a form of security for Company’s remaining performance as specified under the contract, which is consistent 
with the industry practice. Contract liabilities represent amounts billed to customers in excess of revenue 
recognised till date. A liability is recognised for advance payments and it is not considered as a significant 
financing component because it is used to meet working capital requirements at the time of project mobilisation 
stage. The same is presented as contract liability in the statement of financial position.
	
	
	
	
Estimates of revenues, costs or extent of progress toward completion are revised if circumstances change. Any 
resulting increases or decreases in estimated revenues or costs are reflected in Standalone Statement of profit 
and loss in the period in which the circumstances that give rise to the revision become known by management.
	
	
	
	
For construction contracts the control is transferred over time and revenue is recognised based on the extent 
of progress towards completion of the performance obligations. When it is probable that total contract costs will 
exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense immediately. The percentage of 
completion was calculated according to the nature and the specific risk of each contract in order to reflect the 
effective completion of the project. This percentage of completion could be based on technical milestones or 
as per the contractual terms specified. A construction contract is considered completed when the last technical 
milestone is achieved, which occurs upon contractual transfer of ownership of the asset.
	
	
	
(ii)	
Sale of Services (Operation and Maintenance contracts)
	
	
	
	
Revenue from providing operating and maintenance services is recognised in the accounting period in which the 
services are rendered. Invoices are issued according to contractual terms and are usually payable as per the 
credit period agreed with the customer.
	
	
	
(iii)	 Interest income
	
	
	
	
Interest income from financial assets at fair value through profit or loss is disclosed as interest income within 
other income. Interest income on financial assets at amortised cost using the effective interest method is 
recognised in the Standalone Statement of profit and loss as part of other income.
	
	
	
	
Interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of a financial 
asset except for financial assets that subsequently become credit-impaired. For credit-impaired financial assets 
the effective interest rate is applied to the net carrying amount of the financial asset (after deduction of the 
loss allowance).
	
	
	
(iv)	 Other income
	
	
	
	
All other income is accounted on accrual basis when no significant uncertainty exist regarding the amount that 
will be received.
	
	
v.	
Income tax
	
	
	
The income tax expense or credit for the period is the tax payable on the current period’s taxable income based 
on the applicable income tax rate adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to 
temporary differences.
	
	
	
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the end 
of the reporting period. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations 
in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation and considers whether it is probable that a taxation 
authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment. The Company measures its tax balances either based on the most 
likely amount or the expected value, depending on which method provides a better prediction of the resolution of 
the uncertainty.
188

Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax 
bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the Standalone financial statements. Deferred income tax 
is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the end of the reporting 
period and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax 
liability is settled.
	
	
	
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses / tax credits only if 
it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences.
	
	
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets 
and liabilities and when the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority. Current tax assets and tax 
liabilities are offset where the entity has a legally enforceable right to offset and intends either to settle on a net basis, 
or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
	
	
	
Current and deferred tax is recognised in Standalone Statement of profit and loss, except to the extent that it relates to 
items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.
	
	
vi.	
Leases
	
	
	
As a lessee
	
	
	
Leases are recognised as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset is 
available for use by the Company.
	
	
	
Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include the 
net present value of the following lease payments:
 
 
fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable and
 
 
payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Company exercising that option.
	
	
	
Lease payments to be made under reasonably certain extension options are also included in the measurement of the 
liability. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be readily 
determined, which is generally the case for leases in the Company, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate is used, 
being the rate that the individual lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar 
value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment with similar terms, security and conditions.
	
	
	
To determine the incremental borrowing rate, the Company:
 
 
where possible, uses recent third-party financing received by the individual lessee as a starting point, adjusted 
to reflect changes in financing conditions since third party financing was received
 
 
uses a build-up approach that starts with a risk-free interest rate adjusted for credit risk for leases held by 
Company, which does not have recent third party financing, and makes adjustments specific to the lease, e.g. 
term, country, currency and security.
	
	
	
Lease payments are allocated between principal and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to Standalone 
Statement of profit and loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining 
balance of the liability for each period.
	
	
	
Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:
 
 
the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability
 
 
any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received
 
 
any initial direct costs, and
 
 
restoration costs.
189

Financial Statements
Notes forming part of the Standalone Financial Statements
as of and for the year ended March 31, 2024
	
	
	
Right-of-use assets are generally depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a 
straight-line basis.
	
	
	
Payments associated with short-term leases of equipment and all leases of low-value assets are recognised on a 
straight-line basis as an expense in Standalone Statement of profit and loss. Short-term leases are leases with a 
lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets comprise IT equipment and small items of office furniture.
	
	
vii.	 Impairment of non-financial assets
	
	
	
Assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount 
may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount 
exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal 
and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there 
are separately identifiable cash inflows which are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or group 
of assets (cash-generating units). Non-financial assets that suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal 
of the impairment at the end of each reporting period.
	
	
viii.	 Cash and cash equivalents
	
	
	
For the purpose of presentation in the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, 
deposits held at call with financial institutions, other short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of 
three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant 
risk of changes in value, and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities in the 
Standalone Balance Sheet.
	
	
ix.	
Trade receivables
	
	
	
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for goods sold or services performed in the ordinary course of 
business. Trade receivables are recognised initially at the amount of consideration that is unconditional unless they 
contain significant financing components, when they are recognised at fair value. The Company holds the trade 
receivables with the objective to collect the contractual cash flows and therefore measures them subsequently at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method, less loss allowance.
	
	
x.	
Inventories
	
	
	
Inventories are stated at lower of cost and net realizable value.
	
	
	
Cost of raw material, stores and spare parts and construction materials includes cost of purchases and other cost 
incurred in bringing the inventories to the present location and condition. Cost is determined using rolling weighted 
average method.
	
	
	
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of 
completion and the estimated costs necessary to complete the contract.
	
	
xi.	
Financial instruments
	
	
	
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity 
instrument of another entity.
	
	
	
Financial assets and liabilities are recognized when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of 
the instrument.

Financial Assets:
	
	
	
Classification
	
	
	
The Company classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:
 
 
those measured subsequently at fair value (either through other comprehensive income, or through 
profit or loss) and
 
 
those measured at amortized cost.
	
	
	
The classification depends on the entity’s business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms 
of the cash flows.
	
	
	
Initial recognition and measurement
	
	
	
Financial assets are recognized when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. 
Financial assets are recognized initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value 
through profit or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction 
costs of financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are expensed of in the Standalone Statement of 
profit and loss.
	
	
	
Subsequent measurement
	
	
	
After initial recognition, financial assets are measured at:
 
 
fair value (either through other comprehensive income, or through profit or loss)
 
 
amortized cost
	
	
	
When assets are measured at fair value, gains and losses are either recognised in the Standalone Statement of profit 
and loss (i.e. fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)), or recognised in Other Comprehensive Income (i.e. fair value 
through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)).
	
	
	
(i)	
Financial assets measured at amortised cost:
	
`	
	
	
Assets that are held for collecting contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of 
principal and interest are measured at amortised cost. Interest income from these financial assets is included 
in financial income using effective interest rate method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognised 
directly in profit or loss and presented in other gain/(losses).
	
	
	
(ii)	
Financial assets measured at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (“FVTOCI”):
	
	
	
	
Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets, where the assets' 
cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at FVOCI. Movements in the 
carrying amount are taken through OCI, except for the recognition of impairment gains of losses, interest income 
and foreign exchange gains and losses which are recognised in Standalone Statement of profit and loss. When 
the financial asset is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified 
from equity to profit or loss and recognised in other gains/(losses). Interest income from these financial assets 
is included in other income using the effective interest rate method. Foreign exchange gains and losses are 
presented in other gains/(losses) and impairment expenses are presented as separate line item in Standalone 
Statement of profit and loss.
	
	
	
(iii)	 Financial assets measured at Fair Value through Profit or Loss (“FVTPL”):
	
	
	
	
Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI are measured at fair value through profit or 
loss. A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss is 
recognised in Standalone Statement of profit and loss and presented net within other gains/(losses) in the period 
in which it arises. Interest income from these financial assets is included in other income.

Debt instruments
	
	
	
Subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Company business model for managing the asset and 
the cash flow characteristics of the asset. Debt instrument are classified as amortised cost instruments.
	
	
	
Impairment of Financial Assets
	
	
	
The Company assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit losses (ECL) associated with its financial 
assets carried at amortised cost. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a 
significant increase in credit risk. Note 39(i) details how the Company determines whether there has been a significant 
increase in credit risk.
	
	
	
For trade receivables (including contract assets), the Company applies the simplified approach required by Ind AS 
109, which requires lifetime ECL to be recognised as loss allowances.
	
	
	
Derecognition of Financial Assets
	
	
	
A financial asset is derecognized only when:
 
 
the Company has transferred the rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset or
 
 
retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset, but assumes a contractual obligation 
to pay the cash flows to one or more recipients.
	
	
	
Where the entity has transferred an asset, the Company evaluates whether it has transferred substantially all risks 
and rewards of ownership of the financial asset. In such cases, the financial asset is derecognized. Where the 
entity has not transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, the financial asset is 
not derecognized.
	
	
	
Where the entity has neither transferred a financial asset nor retains substantially all risks and rewards of ownership 
of the financial asset, the financial asset is derecognized if the Company has not retained control of the financial 
asset. Where the Company retains control of the financial asset, the asset is continued to be recognized to the extent 
of continuing involvement in the financial asset.
	
	
	
Financial Liabilities:
	
	
	
Initial recognition and measurement
	
	
	
Financial liabilities are initially measured at its fair value plus or minus, in the case of a financial liability not at fair value 
through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issue/origination of the financial liability.
	
	
	
Subsequent Measurement
	
	
	
Financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortized cost. Financial liabilities are subsequently measured 
at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses 
are recognized in Standalone Statement of profit and loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognized in 
Standalone Statement of profit and loss.
	
	
	
Derecognition
	
	
	
A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires. 
The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability that has been extinguished or transferred to another 
party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognized in 
profit or loss as other gains/(losses).
	
	
xii.	 Offsetting Financial Instruments
	
	
	
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the Standalone Balance Sheet where there 
is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or 
192
H.G. Infra Engineering Limited
Notes forming part of the Standalone Financial Statements
as of and for the year ended March 31, 2024
realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The legally enforceable right must not be contingent on future 
events and must be enforceable in the normal course of business and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy 
of the Company or the counterparty.
	
	
xiii.	 Property, plant and equipment
	
	
	
Freehold land is carried at historical cost. All other items of Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less 
depreciation and impairment. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.
	
	
	
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, 
only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Company and the cost 
of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of any component accounted for as a separate asset is 
derecognized when replaced. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to Standalone Statement of profit and loss 
during the reporting period in which they are incurred.
	
	
	
Transition to Ind AS
	
	
	
On transition to Ind AS, the Company had elected to continue with the carrying value of all of its property, plant and 
equipment measured as per the previous GAAP and use that carrying value as the deemed cost of the property, 
plant and equipment.
	
	
	
Depreciation methods, estimated useful lives and residual value
	
	
	
Depreciation is provided on a pro-rata basis on the written down value (WDV) / Straight Line Method (SLM) over 
the estimated useful lives of the assets, based on technical evaluation done by management's expert, which are 
higher than those specified by Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013, in order to reflect the actual usage of the 
assets. The useful life, residual value and the depreciation method are reviewed at least at each financial year 
end. If the expectations differ from previous estimates, the changes are accounted for prospectively as a change in 
accounting estimate.
	
	
	
The management estimates useful lives of the tangible fixed assets as follows:
Class of Asset

Based on the technical experts assessment of useful life of the aforementioned assets, Plant and machinery i.e Cranes 
are being depreciated over the useful life different from the prescribed useful life under Schedule II the Companies 
Act, 2013. Management believes that such estimated useful lives are realistic and reflect fair approximation of the 
period over which the assets are likely to be used.
	
	
	
* It includes Low value assets (LVA) having useful life of 1 year. 
	
	
	
An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is 
greater than its estimated recoverable amount.
	
	
	
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount. These are included in 
Standalone Statement of profit and loss within other gains/ (losses). (Also refer note 2(a)).

xiv.	 Non-current assets held for sale
	
	
	
Non-current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a 
sale transaction rather than through continuing use and a sale is considered highly probable. They are measured 
at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell, except for assets such as deferred tax assets, 
assets arising from employee benefits, financial assets and contractual rights under insurance contracts, which are 
specifically exempt from this requirement. 
	
	
	
An impairment loss is recognised for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset to fair value less costs to sell. 
A gain is recognised for any subsequent increases in fair value less costs to sell of an asset, but not in excess of any 
cumulative impairment loss previously recognised. A gain or loss not previously recognised by the date of the sale of 
the non-current asset is recognised at the date of de-recognition. 
	
	
	
Non-current assets are not depreciated or amortised while they are classified as held for sale. Interest and other 
expenses attributable to the liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale continue to be recognised. 
	
	
	
Non-current assets classified as held for sale are presented separately from the other assets in the 
Standalone Balance Sheet.
	
	
xv.	 Investment Property
	
	
	
Property that is held for long-term rental yields or for capital appreciation or both, is classified as investment property. 
Investment property is measured initially at its cost, including related transaction costs and where applicable 
borrowing costs. Subsequent expenditure is capitalised to the asset’s carrying amount only when it is probable that 
future economic benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be 
measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance costs are expensed when incurred. When part of an investment 
property is replaced, the carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised.
	
	
	
Investment properties are depreciated using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives. Investment 
properties have a useful life of 60 years. The useful life has been determined based on technical evaluation performed 
by the management expert.
	
	
xvi.	 Intangible assets
	
	
	
Costs associated with maintaining software programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred. 
	
	
	
Purchases costs are recorded as intangible assets and amortised from the point at which the asset is available for use.
	
	
	
Transition to Ind AS
	
	
	
On transition to Ind AS, the Company has elected to continue with the carrying value of its intangible assets measured 
as per the previous GAAP and use that carrying value as the deemed cost of the intangible assets.
	
	
	
Amortisation methods and periods
	
	
	
The Company amortises intangible assets with a finite useful life using the straight-line method over the 
following periods:

xvii.	Trade and other payables
	
	
	
These amounts represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Company prior to the end of the financial 
year which are unpaid. The amounts are unsecured. Trade and other payables are presented as current liabilities 
unless payment is not due within 12 months after the reporting period.

xviii.	Borrowings
	
	
	
Borrowings are initially recognized at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently 
measured at amortized cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption 
amount is recognized in Standalone Statement of profit and loss over the period of the borrowings using the effective 
interest method.
	
	
	
Borrowings are removed from the Standalone Balance Sheet when the obligation specified in the contract is 
discharged, cancelled or expired.
	
	
	
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Company has an unconditional right to defer settlement of 
the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period.
	
	
xix.	 Provisions and contingent liabilities
	
	
	
Provisions
	
	
	
Provisions are recognised when Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, 
it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably 
estimated. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
	
	
	
Provisions are measured at the present value of management’s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle 
the present obligation at the end of the reporting period. The discount rate used to determine the present value is a 
pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. 
The increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as interest expense.
	
	
	
Contingent liabilities
	
	
	
Contingent liabilities are disclosed when there is a possible obligation arising from past events, the existence of which 
will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within 
the control of the Company, or a present obligation that arises from past events where it is either not probable that an 
outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the amount cannot be made.
	
	
xx.	 Employee benefits
	
	
	
(i)	
Short term obligations
	
	
	
	
Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary benefits that are expected to be settled wholly within 
12 months after the end of the period in which the employees render the related service are recognized in 
respect of employees’ services up to the end of the reporting period and are measured at the amounts expected 
to be paid when the liabilities are settled. The liabilities are presented as current employee benefit obligations in 
the Standalone Balance Sheet.
	
	
	
(ii)	
Other long term employee benefit obligations
	
	
	
	
The liabilities for earned leave and sick leave are not expected to be settled wholly within 12 months after 
the end of the period in which the employees render the related service. They are therefore measured as the 
present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the 
end of the reporting period using the projected unit credit method. The benefits are discounted using the market 
yields at the end of the reporting period that have terms approximating to the terms of the related obligation. 
Remeasurements as a result of experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognized 
in Standalone Statement of profit and loss.
	
	
	
	
The obligations are presented as current liabilities in the Standalone Balance Sheet if the Company does not 
have an unconditional right to defer settlement for at least twelve months after the reporting period, regardless 
of when the actual settlement is expected to occur.

(iii)	 Post-employment obligations
	
	
	
	
The Company operates the following post-employment schemes.
 
 
Defined benefit plan i.e. gratuity
 
 
Defined contribution plans such as provident fund, superannuation etc.
	
	
	
	
Gratuity obligations (Also, Refer note 2(b))
	
	
	
	
The liability or asset recognized in the Standalone Balance Sheet in respect of defined benefit gratuity plan is 
the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan 
assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
	
	
	
	
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash 
outflows by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds that have terms 
approximating to the terms of the related obligation.
	
	
	
	
The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defined benefit obligation 
and the fair value of plan assets. This cost is included in employee benefit expense in the Standalone Statement 
of profit and loss .
	
	
	
	
Remeasurement gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions 
are recognized in the period in which they occur, directly in other comprehensive income. They are included in 
retained earnings in the statement of changes in equity and in the Standalone Balance Sheet.
	
	
	
	
Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation resulting from plan amendments or curtailments 
are recognized immediately in Standalone Statement of profit and loss as past service cost.
	
	
	
	
Defined contribution plans
	
	
	
	
The Company pays contribution to defined contribution schemes such as provident fund etc. The Company has 
no further payment obligation once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are accounted for as 
defined contribution plans and the contributions are recognized as employee benefit expense when they are due.
	
	
	
	
Bonus plans
	
	
	
	
The Company recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses. The Company recognises a provision where 
contractually obliged or where there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation.
	
	
xxi.	 Contributed equity
	
	
	
Equity shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are 
shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
	
	
xxii.	Dividends
	
	
	
Provision is made for the amount of any dividend declared, being appropriately authorised and no longer at the 
discretion of the entity, on or before the end of the reporting period but not distributed at the end of the reporting period.
	
	
xxiii.	Earnings per share
	
	
	
(i)	
Basic earnings per share
	
	
	
	
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing:
 
 
The profit attributable to owners of the Company; and
 
 
By the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the financial year, adjusted for bonus 
elements in equity shares issued during the year

as of and for the year ended March 31, 2024
	
	
	
(ii)	
Diluted earnings per share
	
	
	
	
Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to 
take into account:
 
 
the after income tax effect of interest and other financing costs associated with dilutive potential 
equity shares, and
 
 
the weighted average number of additional equity shares that would have been outstanding assuming the 
conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares.
	
	
xxiv.	Rounding of amounts
	
	
	
All amounts disclosed in the Standalone financial statements and notes have been rounded off to the nearest million 
as per the requirement of Schedule III, unless otherwise stated.
	
2	
Critical estimates and judgments
	
	
The preparation of the Standalone financial statements requires use of accounting estimates which, by definition, will seldom 
equal the actual results. Management also needs to exercise judgment in applying the Company’s accounting policies.
	
	
This note provides an overview of the areas that involved a higher degree of judgments or complexity, and of items which 
are more likely to be materially adjusted due to estimates and assumptions turning out to be different than those originally 
assessed. Detailed information about each of these estimates and judgments is included in relevant notes together with 
information about the basis of calculation for each affected line item in the Standalone financial statements.
	
	
The areas involving critical estimates or judgments are:
	
	
(a)	
Estimation of useful life of Property, plant and equipment
	
	
	
The Company estimates the useful life of the Property, plant and equipment as mentioned in note 1(xiii) above, which 
is based on the expected technical obsolescence of such assets. However, the actual useful life may be shorter or 
longer than the life estimated, depending on technical innovations and competitor actions.
	
	
(b)	 Estimation of defined benefit obligation
	
	
	
The cost of the defined benefit gratuity plan and other post-employment employee benefits and the present value 
of the gratuity obligation are determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various 
assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount 
rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term 
nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed 
at each reporting date. The parameter most subject to change is the discount rate. In determining the appropriate 
discount rate for plans operated in India, the management considers the interest rates of government bonds in 
currencies consistent with the currencies of the post-employment benefit obligation. The mortality rate is based on 
publicly available Indian Assured Lives Mortality (2012-14) Ultimate. Those mortality tables tend to change only at 
interval in response to demographic changes. Future salary increases and gratuity increases are based on expected 
future inflation rates for the respective countries. Refer note 44 for key actuarial assumptions.
	
	
(c)	
Revenue recognition for construction contract - Refer note 1 (iv) and note 52
	
	
(d)	 Impairment of trade receivables (including Contract Assets) – Refer note 1 (ix) and 7,11, 16(a) and 39(i)
	
	
(e)	
Estimation of fair value of level 3 financial instruments
	
	
	
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined using valuation techniques. 
The Company uses its judgment to select a variety of methods and make assumptions that are mainly based on 
market conditions existing at the end of each reporting period. Refer note 38 on fair value measurements where the 
assumptions and methods to perform the same are stated.

(ii)	 Fair value hierarchy		
	
	
	
This section explains the judgments and estimates made in determining the fair value of the financial instruments that are 
measured at amortised cost and for which fair value are disclosed in the financial statements.
	
Level 1: Level 1 hierarchy includes financial instruments measured using quoted prices. This includes instruments like listed 
equity instruments, traded bonds and mutual funds that have quoted price.
	
Level 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, traded bonds, over-the 
counter derivatives etc) is determined using valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable market data and rely 
as little as possible on entity-specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the 
instrument is included in level 2.	
	
Level 3: If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3. 
This is in the case of unlisted securities.
(iii)	 Fair value of financial instruments measured at amortised cost - Level 3

The carrying amounts of short term loans, trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents, bank balances other than cash and 
cash equivalents, other receivables, trade payables, current borrowings, interest accrued, capital creditors and other payables 
are considered to be the same as their fair value due to their short-term nature. The impact of fair value on non-current financial 
assets and non-current financial liabilities (not considered above) is not expected to have material impact on the standalone 
financial statements, hence not dislcosed above.
	
The fair value of security deposits were not calculated based on their future cash flows discounted at current lending rate as 
these security deposits are expected to continue to remain till the existence of the Company.
Note 39 - Financial Risk Management

contract assets, security deposits, deposit with banks, loans, others receivables and cash and cash equivalents.

While cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks are subject to impairment requirements of Ind AS 109, the identified 
impairment on these assets is Nil.
	
For Trade receivables and Contract assets for construction contracts : Management makes the assessment of the credit risk 
on trade receivables and contract assets considering the customer profile. Customers of the Company mainly consists of the 
government promoted entities and some large private corporates. In case of government customers which forms the majority of 
the revenue, credit risk is low.
	
Considering the nature of business, each contract and its customer is evaluated for the purpose of assessment of loss allowances. 
The reasons for loss allowances could be recovery of claims, disputes with customer, customers ability to pay, delays in approval 
by government authorities, and expected time to recover the amount. Management makes an assessment considering facts of 
each contract, past trends, terms of the contract and accordingly considers the need for loss allowances, if any.
	
For Loans and Other receivables : The Company’s investments in debt instruments and certain loans are considered to be 
low risk investments.

(a)	
Foreign currency risk
	
	
Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of changes 
in foreign exchange rates. The Company’s exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates is insignificant and 
relates primarily to the Company’s creditors for capital expenditures. The Company’s foreign currency risks are identified, 
measured and managed at periodic intervals in accordance with the Company’s policies. As at March 31, 2024, Company's 
foreign currency exposure amounts to H 47.90 Million (as at March 31, 2023 H 47.44 Million).

Sensitivity
	
	
	
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in Euro exchange rates with all other 
variables held constant.
	
	
	
The Change in exchange rates does not affect the components of other equity.
	
(b)	 Interest risk
	
	
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes 
in market interest rates. The Company's exposure to risk of changes in market rate is limited to short term working capital 
loans at variable rate taken from banks as the Company's long term borrowings bear fixed interest rate.
	
	
The Company’s fixed rate borrowings are carried at amortised cost. They are therefore not subject to interest rate risk as 
defined in Ind AS 107, since neither the carrying amount nor the future cash flows will fluctuate because of a change in 
market interest rates.
	
	
The Company manages the interest rate risk by having a balanced portfolio of fixed and variable rate borrowings. The 
exposure of the Company’s borrowing to interest rate changes at the end of the reporting period are as follows:

Sensitivity
	
	
	
Profit or loss is sensitive to higher / lower interest expense as a result of changes in interest rates. A 20 basis point 
increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel and represents 
management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates. With all other variables held constant, 
the Company’s profit before tax will be impacted by a change in interest rate as follows:

Note 40 - Capital Management
(a)	 Risk Management
	
For the purpose of the Company’s capital management, capital includes issued equity capital and all other equity reserves 
attributable to the equity holders of the Company and borrowings.
	
The Company aims to manage its capital efficiently so as to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern and to optimise

and manage the capital structure in light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets.

Company's policy is to maintain a stable and strong capital structure with a focus on total equity so as to maintain investor, 
creditors and market confidence and to sustain future development and growth of its business. The Company will take appropriate

Sensitivity Analysis
	
	
The sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to increase and decrease in the weighted principal assumptions by 
0.50% is as below:

The above sensitivity analysis are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In 
practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. The methods and types of 
assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared to the prior period.
(iii)	 The major categories of plans assets are as follows:
	
The plan asset for the funded gratuity plan is administered by Life Insurance Corporation of India ('LIC') & Aditya Birla Sun 
Life Insurance Company Liimited (ABSLI) as per the investment pattern stipulated for Pension and Group Schemes fund by 
Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority regulations i.e. 100% of plan assets are invested in insurer managed fund. 
Quoted price of the same is not available in active market.
(iv)	 Risk Exposure
	
Through its defined benefit plans, the Company is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below:
	
Demographic Risk : This is the risk of variability of results due to unsystematic nature of decrements that include mortality, 
withdrawal, disability and retirement. The effect of these decrements on the defined benefit obligation is not straight forward and 
depends upon the combination of salary increase, discount rate and vesting criteria. It is important not to overstate withdrawals 
because in the financial analysis the retirement benefit of a short career employee typically costs less per year as compared to 
a long service employee.
	
Asset volatility : The defined benefit plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to bond yields; if plan 
assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit. 100% of the plan asset investments is in insurer managed funds. These 
are subject to interest rate risk and the fund manages interest rate risk with derivatives to minimise risk to an acceptable level.

as of and for the year ended March 31, 2024
(All amounts are in H million, unless otherwise stated)
	
Salary Inflation Risk : Higher than expected increases in salary will increase the defined benefit obligation.	
	
Interest-Rate Risk : The defined benefit obligation calculated uses a discount rate based on government bonds. If bond yields 
fall, the defined benefit obligation will tend to increase.
(v)	 Defined Benefit Obligations and Employer Contributions
	
The Company considers that the contribution rates set at the last valuation date are sufficient to eliminate the deficit over the 
agreed period and that regular contributions, which are based on service costs, will not increase significantly.
	
Expected contributions to defined benefit plans for the year ending March 31, 2024 are H 99.79 Million (Year ending March 31, 
2023 H 134.80 million).
	
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 3.04 years (March 31, 2023: 6.16 years). The expected 
maturity analysis of undiscounted gratuity is as follows:

H.G. Infra Engineering Limited
Independent Auditor’s Report
Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial 
statements 
of 
H.G. 
Infra 
Engineering 
Limited 
(“the 
Company”), which includes two jointly controlled operations 
consolidated on proportionate basis (hereinafter referred to as 
“the Holding Company”), its subsidiaries (Holding Company 
and its subsidiaries together referred to as “the Group”) and its 
associates (Refer Note 51 to consolidated financial statements), 
which comprise the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at March 31, 
2024, the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss (including 
Other Comprehensive Income), the Consolidated Statement 
of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Statement of Cash 
Flows for the year then ended, and notes to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements, including material accounting policies 
and other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as the 
“consolidated financial statements”).
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according 
to the explanations given to us, and based on consideration of 
reports of other auditors on separate financial statements and the 
other financial information of subsidiaries and jointly controlled 
operations, the aforesaid consolidated financial statements 
give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (“the 
Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view 
in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed 
under Section 133 of the Act read with Companies (Indian 
Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended (“Ind AS”) 
and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of 
their consolidated state of affairs of the Group and its associates 
as at March 31, 2024, its consolidated total comprehensive 
income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), 
consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash flows for 
the year then ended.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs), as specified 
under Section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under 
those SAs are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities 
for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of 
our report. We are independent of the Group and its associates 
in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to 
our audit of the consolidated financial statements in terms of 
the Code of Ethics issued by Institute of Chartered Accountant 
of India (“ICAI”), and the relevant provisions of the Act and we 
have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance 
with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence 
we have obtained and on consideration of audit reports of other 
auditors referred to in paragraph (a) to (c) of the “Other Matters” 
section below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the 
consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 
31, 2024. These matters were addressed in the context of our 
audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in 
forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate 
opinion on these matters.
Key Audit Matter
Our audit procedures in respect of this area included the 
following:
1.	 Estimation of contract cost and revenue recognition. (Refer 
to Note 1(vi), 2(d), 29 and 53 of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements)
	
Revenue from construction contracts is recognised over a period 
of time in accordance with the requirements of Ind AS 115, 
‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’. The contract revenue 
amounts to Rs. 50,992.68 million for engineering, procurement 
and construction contracts, which usually extends over a period 
of 2-3 years, and the contract prices are fixed and, in few cases, 
subject to clauses with price variances and variable consideration.
	
In accordance with Input method prescribed under Ind AS 115, the 
contract revenue is measured based on the proportion of contract 
costs incurred for work performed to date relative to the estimated 
total costs. This method requires the management to perform an 
initial assessment of total estimated cost and reassess the total 
i.	
Evaluated the accounting policy for revenue recognition and 
assessed compliance of the policy with the principles enunciated 
under Ind AS 115 - ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customer’.
ii.	 Understood and evaluated the design and tested the operating 
effectiveness of key internal financial controls, including those 
related to review and approval of estimated costs and review 
of provision for foreseeable losses, if any, by the authorised 
representatives. 
iii.	 We obtained the revenue workings (percentage of completion 
calculations) from the management, for all contracts, containing 
costs incurred, estimated costs (comprising of actual costs and 
remaining costs to completion), estimated contract revenue and 
actual revenues recognised during the year based on proportion 
of actual costs to estimated costs. For sample of contracts, we 
agreed contract revenue with key contractual terms, agreed 
To the Members of H.G. Infra Engineering Limited

Financial Statements
Key Audit Matter
Our audit procedures in respect of this area included the 
following:
	
construction cost at the end of each reporting period to determine 
the appropriate percentage of completion.
	
The estimation of total cost to complete the contract involves 
significant judgement and estimation throughout the period of 
contract, as it is subject to revision as the contract progresses – 
based on latest available information including physical work done 
on the ground, changes in cost estimates and need to accrue 
provision for onerous contracts, if any. Besides recognition of 
revenues based on actual costs and estimated costs to complete 
the work, at the period end, the measurement and recognition 
of contract assets (unbilled revenue) and contract liabilities 
(unearned revenue) related to each of the contracts is also 
dependent on cost estimates.
	
In view of above, we have considered the estimation of 
construction contract costs as a key audit matter.
	
actual costs with system generated reports and agreed estimated 
costs with costs sheets for individual contracts approved by 
the authorised representatives. Reperformed the calculation 
of revenues during the year using proportion of actual costs to 
estimated costs and compared the results with workings provided 
to us.
iv.	 For actual costs incurred during FY 2023-24, we tested the 
samples to appropriate supporting documents.
v.	 To validate the remaining costs to completion, for sample 
contracts, we obtained the approved costs sheets (for each of 
such sample contracts) containing the breakdown of such costs. 
Evaluated the reasonableness of management’s judgements 
and assumptions through comparison of actual margins 
during the year with base margins estimated at the beginning, 
comparison between financial progress (proportion of actual 
costs to estimated costs) and physical progress certified by the 
Independent Engineer, past trends of recovery of price escalation 
with incremental costs incurred and  comparison of actual costs 
within similar contracts. 
vi.	 Assessed the adequacy and appropriateness of the disclosures 
made in consolidated financial statements in compliance with the 
requirements of Ind AS 115.
2.	 Valuation of accounts receivable and contract assets in view 
of risk of credit losses. (Refer note 1(xi), 39(i), 2(e), 7 and 
11 – Trade Receivables and Note 16(a) for contract asset to 
Consolidated Financial Statements)
	
Accounts receivable and Contract assets are significant items 
in the Group’s consolidated financial statements aggregating 
to Rs. 17,692.81 million as of March 31, 2024 and provision 
for impairment of receivables and contract assets amounted 
to Rs. 571.99 million as at March 31, 2024. The Group has a 
concentration of credit exposure on certain customers, which 
include government and private organisations, where there are 
delays in collections due to various reasons.
	
The management periodically assess the adequacy of provisions 
recognised, as applicable, on receivables and contract assets, 
based on factors such as credit risk of the customer, status of the 
project, discussions with the customers and underlying contractual 
terms and conditions. This involves significant judgement
	
Given the relative significance of these receivables and contract 
assets to the consolidated financial statements and the nature and 
extent of audit procedures involved to assess the recoverability of 
receivables and contract assets, we determined this to be a key 
audit matter.
i.	
Understood and evaluated the design and tested the operating 
effectiveness of key internal financial controls in relation to 
determination of expected credit loss.
ii.	 Obtained confirmation from parties, for sample balances, with 
respect to outstanding balances. Wherever confirmations are not 
received for the samples, performed alternate procedures through 
verification of invoices approved by the respective customers 
which represents acknowledgement of work delivered.
iii.	 Performed inquiry procedures with senior management regarding 
status of collectability of the receivable and contract assets.
iv.	 In respect of material contract balances, corroborated our inquiry 
procedures with the correspondence between the Group and the 
customers, contracts and other documents.
v.	 Assessed the inputs used by the Management to determine the 
amount of allowances by considering factors such as credit risk 
of the customer, cash collections, past history and status of the 
project, and correspondence with customers.
vi.	 Presented the results of our work done to the audit committee.
vii.	 Assessed the adequacy and appropriateness of the disclosures 
made in the consolidated financial statements in this regard.

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not 
cover the other information and we will not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read the other information 
identified above when it becomes available and, in doing 
so, consider whether the other information is materially 
inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our 
knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be 
materially misstated.
When we read the annual report, if we conclude that there is a 
material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate 
the matter to those charged with governance and describe 
actions applicable under the applicable laws and regulations.
Responsibilities of Management and Board of 
Directors for the Consolidated Financial Statements
The Holding Company’s Management and Board of Directors 
are responsible for the preparation and presentation of these 
consolidated financial statements in term of the requirements 
of the Act that give a true and fair view of the consolidated 
financial position, consolidated financial performance (including 
other comprehensive income), consolidated changes in equity 
and consolidated cash flows of the Group and its associates in 
accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted 
in India, including the Accounting Standards specified under 
Section 133 of the Act. The respective Management and Board 
of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of 
its associates are responsible for maintenance of adequate 
accounting records in accordance with the provisions of 
the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Group and of its 
associates for preventing and detecting frauds and other 
irregularities; the selection and application of appropriate 
accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and 
maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were 
operating effectively for ensuring accuracy and completeness

The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in 
the Group and of its associates are responsible for overseeing 
the financial reporting process of each company.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or 
error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a 
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Standards 
on Auditing (“SAs”) will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error 
and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated 
financial statements.
We give in “Annexure A” a detailed description of Auditor’s 
responsibilities for Audit of the consolidated financial statements.

by the other auditors of the subsidiaries 
whose financial statements have been 
audited under the Act, and according to 
the information and explanations provided 
to us by the Management of the Holding 
Company in this regard nothing has come 
to our or other auditors’ notice that has

have a feature of recording audit trail (edit log) 
facility and the same has operated throughout 
the year for all relevant transactions recorded in 
the respective softwares:
	
	
	
i.	
The Holding Company has also used 
two SAAS based applications (related to 
processing of leave and travel related data 
of employees) for maintaining its books of 
accounts. For these two applications, we 
were not able to verify whether the feature 
of recording audit trail (edit log) facility has 
been operated throughout the year for all 
relevant transactions, as no underlying 
evidence, related to audit trail (edit log) 
facility, could be arranged by the Holding 
Company from the service providers who 
manage these applications.
	
	
	
ii.	
In case of six subsidiaries, the feature

transactions recorded in the software.
	
	
	
iii.	
In case of three subsidiaries, the feature 
of recording audit trail (edit log) facility 
was enabled on May 12, 2023 and has 
operated till March 31, 2024, for all relevant 
transactions recorded in the software.
	
	
	
iv.	
In case of four subsidiaries incorporated 
during the year, the feature of recording 
audit trail (edit log) facility was enabled 
on the date of their incorporation and has 
operated till March 31, 2024, for all relevant 
transactions recorded in the software.
	
	
	
v.	
In case of three subsidiaries disposed off 
during the year, the feature of recording 
audit trail (edit log) facility was enabled 
on May 17, 2023 onwards, for all relevant 
transactions recorded in the software.
	
	
	
Further, where audit trail (edit log) facility 
was enabled and operated, we did not come 
across any instance of audit trail feature being 
tampered with, during the period in which it was 
operational, as mentioned above, during the 
course of our audit.
	
C.	
In our opinion, according to information and 
explanations given to us, the remuneration paid/
provided by the entities included in the Group, which 
are incorporated as companies, to their respective 
directors is within the limits prescribed under Section

Annexure A to the Independent Auditor’s Report
on even date on the Consolidated Financial Statements of H.G. Infra Engineering Limited
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:
 
 
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of 
the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud 
or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive 
to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The 
risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting 
from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as 
fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
 
 
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to 
the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of 
the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion 
on whether the Holding Company has adequate internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements in 
place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
 
 
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates 
and related disclosures made by the management and 
Board of Directors.
 
 
Conclude on the appropriateness of the management 
and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis of 
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, 
whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or 
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the ability 
of the Group and its associates to continue as a going 
concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, 
we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report 
to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial 
statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to 
modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit 
evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. 
However, future events or conditions may cause the Group 
and its associates to cease to continue as a going concern.
 
 
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content 
of the consolidated financial statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial 
statements represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
 
 
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the 
financial information of the entities or business activities 
within the Group and its associates to express an 
opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are 
responsible for the direction, supervision and performance 
of the audit of the financial statements of such entities 
included in the consolidated financial statements of which 
we are the independent auditors. For the other entities 
included in the consolidated financial statements, which 
have been audited by other auditors, such other auditors 
remain responsible for the direction, supervision and 
performance of the audits carried out by them. We remain 
solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with those charged with governance of 
the Holding Company and such other entities included in 
the consolidated financial statements of which we are the 
independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the 
planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit 
findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control 
that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement 
that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements 
regarding independence, and to communicate with them 
all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be 
thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, 
related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended March 31, 2024 and are therefore the key 
audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s 
report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure 
about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we 
determine that a matter should not be communicated in our 
report because the adverse consequences of doing so would 
reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits 
of such communication.

Annexure B to the Independent Auditor’s Report
of even date on the Consolidated Financial Statements of H.G. Infra Engineering Limited
[Referred to in paragraph 2A(f) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ in the Independent Auditors’ Report of even 
date to the Members of H.G. Infra Engineering Limited on the consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2024]
Report on the Internal Financial Controls under 
Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the 
Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)
Opinion
In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements of H.G. Infra Engineering Limited (hereinafter referred 
to as “the Holding Company”) as of and for the year ended 
March 31, 2024, we have audited the internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements of the Holding Company 
and its subsidiaries, which are companies incorporated under 
the Act, as of that date. Reporting under clause (i) of sub section 
3 of Section 143 of the Act in respect of the adequacy of the 
internal financial controls with reference to financial statements 
is not applicable to two subsidiaries (H.G. Norangdesar Solar 
Private Limited and H.G. Rasisar Solar Private Limited), two 
associates (Safety First Engineering Private Limited and  Safety 
First (Partnership Firm)) and two jointly controlled operations 
(HGIEPL — Ranjit (JV), HGIEPL — MGCPL (JV)), pursuant to 
MCA notification GSR 583(E) dated 13 June 2017.
In our opinion, and to the best of our information and according 
to the explanations given to us, the Holding Company and its 
subsidiaries, have, in all material respects, an adequate internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements and such 
internal financial controls with reference to financial statements 
were operating effectively as at March 31, 2024, based on the 
internal financial controls with reference to financial statements 
criteria established by the respective companies considering the 
essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance 
Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial 
Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of 
India (“the ICAI”).
Management and Board of Director’s Responsibility for 
Internal Financial Controls
The respective Management and the Board of Directors of the 
Holding Company and its subsidiaries, which are companies 
incorporated under the Act, are responsible for establishing 
and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal 
control with reference to consolidated financial statements 
criteria established by the respective companies considering the 
essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance 
Note. These responsibilities include the design, implementation 
and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were 
operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct 
of its business, including adherence to the respective company’s 
policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and 
detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness 
of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable 
financial information, as required under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements based 
on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the 
Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over 
Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) issued by the ICAI 
and the Standards on Auditing prescribed under section 143(10) 
of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial 
controls. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that 
we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the 
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate 
internal financial controls with reference to financial statements 
was established and maintained and if such controls operated 
effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements and their operating 
effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements included obtaining an understanding of 
internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, 
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing 
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal 
control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected 
depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of 
the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and 
the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms of 
their reports referred to in the Other Matter paragraph below, 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls With Reference 
to Financial Statements
A company's internal financial control with reference to financial 
statements is a process designed to provide reasonable 
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the 
preparation of consolidated financial statements for external 
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles. A company's internal financial control with reference 
to financial statements includes those policies and procedures 
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable 
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and 
260
H.G. Infra Engineering Limited
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable 
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit 
preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts 
and expenditures of the company are being made only in 
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of 
the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding 
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, 
or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material 
effect on the consolidated financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with 
Reference to Consolidated Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements, including the possibility 
of collusion or improper management override of controls, 
material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not 
be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements to 
future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial 
control with reference to financial statements may become 
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree 
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Other Matter
(a)	
Our aforesaid report under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on 
the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements 
insofar as it relates to fourteen subsidiaries is based on the 
corresponding reports of the auditors of such companies 
incorporated under the Act.
	
Our opinion is not modified in respect of the above matter 
with respect to our reliance on the work done and the 
reports of the other auditors.

H.G. Infra Engineering Limited
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
as of and for the year ended March 31, 2024
Background
H.G. Infra Engineering Limited ("Parent Company or the Company") is a public limited Company listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange 
and National Stock Exchange on March 9, 2018. Its registered office is at 14, Panchwati Colony, Ratanada, Jodhpur – 342001, 
Rajasthan, India. The Parent Company (including 2 jointly controlled operations consolidated on proportionate basis), 14 wholly 
owned subsidiaries and 2 step down subsidiaries together referred to as “the Group”.
The Group is engaged in Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC), maintenance of roads, bridges, flyovers, railway 
networks and other infrastructure contract works. The Group is also engaged in projects under Hybrid Annuity Model through 
Subsidiary Companies.
These consolidated financial statements were reviewed by Audit Committee and authorized to be issued by the Board of Directors 
on May 08, 2024. Also, the Company secures contracts by submitting bids in response to tenders in terms of which it is required to 
form Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) Companies (subsidiary companies) to execute the awarded projects. As at March 31, 2024 the 
company has 9 SPV’s.
A.	
Basis of preparation
	
(i)	
Compliance with Ind AS
	
	
The consolidated financial statements of the Group comply in all material aspects with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind 
AS) notified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (the Act) read with Rule 4 of the Companies (Indian Accounting 
Standards) Rules, 2015 and other relevant provisions of the Act.
	
(ii)	
Historical cost convention
	
	
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the following:
 
 
Certain financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value;
 
 
Assets held for sale – measured at fair value less cost to sell and
 
 
Defined benefit plans - plan assets measured at fair value
	
(iii)	 New and amended standards adopted by the Group
 
 
The Ministry of Corporate Affairs ("MCA") has notified Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 
2023 dated March 31, 2023 to amend the following Ind AS which are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 
April 01, 2023. The Group has applied these amendments for the first-time in these consolidated financial statements.
 
 
Amendments to Ind AS 1 - Disclosure of accounting policies: The amendments aim to help entities provide accounting 
policy disclosures that are more useful by replacing the requirement for entities to disclose their ‘significant’ accounting 
policies with a requirement to disclose their ‘material’ accounting policies and adding guidance on how entities apply 
the concept of materiality in making decisions about accounting policy disclosures. The amendments have an impact 
on the disclosures of accounting policies, but not on the measurement, recognition or presentation of any items in the 
consolidated financial statements.
 
 
Amendments to Ind AS 8 - Definition of accounting estimates: The amendments clarify the distinction between 
changes in accounting estimates and changes in accounting policies and the correction of errors. It has also been 
clarified how entities use measurement techniques and inputs to develop accounting estimates. The amendments 
had no impact on the consolidated financial statements.
 
 
Amendments to Ind AS 12 - Deferred tax related to assets and liabilities arising from a single transaction: The 
amendments narrow the scope of the initial recognition exception under Ind AS 12, so that it no longer applies to 
transactions that give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences such as leases. This amendment 
does not have any material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
as of and for the year ended March 31, 2024
	
(iv)	 New Standards (including amendments) issued but not yet effective
	
	
MCA notifies new standards or amendments to existing standards under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 
Rules as issued from time to time. During the year ended March 31, 2024, MCA has not notified any new standards or 
amendments to the existing standards applicable to the Group and its associates.
B.	
Operating Cycle
	
The Group classifies an asset as current when:
	
-	
it expects to realise the asset or intends to sell or consume it in normal operating cycle
	
-	
it holds the asset primarily for the purpose of trading
	
-	
it expects to realise the asset within twelve months after the reporting period or
	
-	
the asset is cash or cash equivalent unless the asset is restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at 
least twelve months after the reporting period.
	
All other assets are classified as non-current.
	
The Group classifies a liability as current when:
	
-	
it expects to settle the liability in its normal operating cycle
	
-	
it holds the liability primarily for the purpose of trading
	
-	
the liability is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period, or
	
-	
there is no unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period. Terms 
of a liability that could, at the option of the counterparty, result in its settlement by the issue of equity instruments do not 
affect its classification.
	
All other liabilities are classified as non-current.
	
Operating cycle
	
Operating cycle is the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realization in cash or cash equivalents.
	
Based on the nature of operations and the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realization in cash 
or cash equivalents, the Group has ascertained its operating cycle as twelve months for the purpose of current, non current 
classification of assets and liabilities.
	
1	
Material Accounting Policies
	
	
Pursuant to the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2023 effective 01-04-2023, the company 
is required to disclose ‘material accounting policy Information’ in lieu of the earlier requirement of disclosing ‘significant 
accounting policies’.
	
	
This note provides a list of the material accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these consolidated financial 
statements. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
	
	
Principles of consolidation and equity accounting
	
	
i.	
Subsidiaries
	
	
	
Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls an 
entity when the group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the 
ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the relevant activities of the entity.
268
H.G. Infra Engineering Limited
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
as of and for the year ended March 31, 2024
	
	
	
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated 
from the date when control ceases.
	
	
	
The Group combines the financial statements of the parent and its subsidiaries line by line adding together like items 
of assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses. Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on 
transactions between group Companies are eliminated (Refer Note 57). Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless 
the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the transferred asset. Accounting policies of subsidiaries 
have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group. Details of the 
Subsidiaries are set out in Note 52.
	
	
	
Non-controlling interests
	
	
	
The Group recognises non- controlling interests in an acquired entity either at fair value or at the non- controlling 
interest’s proportionate share of the acquired entity’s net identifiable assets. This decision is made on an acquisition-
by-acquisition basis. For the non-controlling interests, the Group elected to recognise the non- Controlling interests at 
its proportionate share of the acquired net identifiable assets.
	
	
ii.	
Principles of consolidation and equity accounting - Jointly controlled operation
	
	
	
The Holding Company recognises its direct right to the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of joint operations 
and its share of any jointly held or incurred assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. These have been incorporated 
in the standalone financial statements of Holding Company under the appropriate headings. Details of the jointly 
controlled operations are set out in Note 52.

Principles of consolidation and equity accounting - Accounting under Equity method for Associates Entities
	
	
	
Under the equity method of accounting, the investments are initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter 
to recognise the group’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses of the investee in profit and loss, and the 
group’s share of other comprehensive income of the investee in other comprehensive income. Dividends received or 
receivable from associates are recognised as a reduction in the carrying amount of the investment.
	
	
	
When the group’s share of losses in an equity-accounted investment equals or exceeds its interest in the entity, 
including any other unsecured long-term receivables, the group does not recognise further losses, unless it has 
incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the other entity.
	
	
	
Unrealised gains on transactions between the group and its associate are eliminated to the extent of the group’s 
interest in these entities. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an 
impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of equity accounted investees have been changed where 
necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the group.
	
	
	
The carrying amount of equity accounted investments are tested for impairment in accordance with the policy 
described in note 1(xiii)(iii) below.
	
	
iv.	
Segment reporting
	
	
	
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating 
decision maker (CODM). The Managing Director of the Holding Company has been identified as CODM and he 
assesses the financial performance and position of the Holding Company, and makes strategic decisions. Refer Note 
41 for segment information presented.
	
	
v.	
Foreign currency translation
	
	
	
(i)	
Functional and presentation currency
	
	
	
	
Items included in the consolidated financial statements of the Group are measured using the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which the entity operates (`the functional currency'). The consolidated financial 
statements are presented in Indian rupee, which is Holding Company’s functional and presentation currency.

(ii)	
Transactions and balances
	
	
	
	
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates at the dates 
of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and 
from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at year end exchange 
rates are generally recognized in Consolidated Statement profit or loss.
	
	
vi.	
Revenue recognition
	
	
	
The Group derives revenue principally from following streams:
 
 
Construction contracts
 
 
Service concession arrangement
 
 
Sale of Services (Operation and Maintenance contracts)
	
	
	
(i)	
Construction contracts
	
`	
	
	
The Group recognises revenue from engineering, procurement and construction contracts (‘EPC’) over the 
period of time, as performance obligations are satisfied over time due to continuous transfer of control to the 
customer. EPC contracts are generally accounted for as a single performance obligation as it involves complex 
integration of goods and services.
	
	
	
	
The performance obligations are satisfied over time as the work progresses. The Group recognises revenue 
using input method (i.e percentage-of-completion method), based primarily on contract cost incurred to date 
compared to total estimated contract costs. Changes to total estimated contract costs, if any, are recognised in 
the period in which they are determined as assessed at the contract level. If the consideration in the contract 
includes price variation clause or there are amendments in contracts, the Group estimates the amount of 
consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for work performed.
	
	
	
	
Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of the performance obligations, the estimation 
of total revenue and cost of completion is complex, subject to many variables and requires significant judgment. 
Variability in the transaction price arises primarily due to liquidated damages, price variation clauses, changes in 
scope, incentives, if any. The Group considers its experience with similar transactions and expectations regarding 
the contract in estimating the amount of variable consideration to which it will be entitled and determining 
whether the estimated variable consideration should be constrained. The Group includes estimated amounts in 
the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognised will 
not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. The estimates of variable 
consideration are based largely on an assessment of anticipated performance and all information (historical, 
current and forecasted) that is reasonably available.
	
	
	
	
Progress billings are generally issued upon completion of certain phases of the work as stipulated in the contract. 
Billing terms of the over-time contracts vary but are generally based on achieving specified milestones. The 
difference between the timing of revenue recognised and customer billings result in changes to contract assets 
and contract liabilities. Payment is generally due upon receipt of the invoice, payable within 90 days or less. 
Contractual retention amounts billed to customers are generally due upon expiration of the contract period.
	
	
	
	
The contracts generally result in revenue recognised in excess of billings which are presented as contract assets 
on the statement of financial position. Amounts billed and due from customers are classified as receivables on 
the statement of financial position. The portion of the payments retained by the customer until final contract 
settlement is not considered a significant financing component since it is usually intended to provide customer 
with a form of security for Group’s remaining performance as specified under the contract, which is consistent 
with the industry practice. Contract liabilities represent amounts billed to customers in excess of revenue 
recognised till date. A liability is recognised for advance payments and it is not considered as a significant 
financing component because it is used to meet working capital requirements at the time of project mobilisation 
stage. The same is presented as contract liability in the statement of financial position.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
as of and for the year ended March 31, 2024
	
	
	
	
Estimates of revenues, costs or extent of progress toward completion are revised if circumstances change. Any 
resulting increases or decreases in estimated revenues or costs are reflected in Consolidated Statement of profit 
or loss in the period in which the circumstances that give rise to the revision become known by management.
	
	
	
	
For construction contracts the control is transferred over time and revenue is recognised based on the extent 
of progress towards completion of the performance obligations. When it is probable that total contract costs will 
exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense immediately. The percentage of 
completion was calculated according to the nature and the specific risk of each contract in order to reflect the 
effective completion of the project. This percentage of completion could be based on technical milestones or 
as per the contractual terms specified. A construction contract is considered completed when the last technical 
milestone is achieved, which occurs upon contractual transfer of ownership of the asset.
	
	
	
(ii)	
Service concession arrangement
	
	
	
	
Construction revenue from Hybrid Annuity Contracts
	
	
	
	
The Group constructs the infrastructure (road) used to provide a public service and operates and maintains 
that infrastructure for a specified period of time. Under Appendix D to Ind AS 115, Revenue from Contracts 
with Customers, this arrangement is accounted for based on the nature of the consideration. Financial asset is 
recorded when the Company has an unconditional right to receive cash or another financial asset from or at the 
direction of the grantor for the construction services.
	
	
	
	
Design - Build - Operate - Transfer (DBOT) contracts on hybrid annuity basis contain three streams of revenue 
– Construction revenue, Finance income and Operations and maintenance (O&M) income.
	
	
	
	
The construction stream of DBOT revenues are accounted for in the construction phase of DBOT, O&M income 
is recognised in the operating phase of the DBOT, while finance income is recognised over the concession 
period based on the imputed interest method.
	
	
	
	
Service concession arrangement
	
	
	
	
Revenue related to construction services provided under the service concession arrangement is recognised 
based on stage of completion of the work performed. The stage of completion is assessed by reference to input 
method i.e. cost incurred till date in proportion to total estimated cost to complete the work.
	
	
	
	
Contract Balances - Contract Assets
	
	
	
	
A contract asset is the right to consideration in exchange for goods or services transferred to the customer. If 
respective entities in the Group performs by transferring goods or services to a customer before the customer 
pays consideration or before payment is due, a contract asset is recognised for the earned consideration that 
is conditional.
	
	
	
	
Contract assets represent revenue recognized in excess of amounts billed and include unbilled receivables. 
Unbilled receivables, which represent an unconditional right to payment subject only to the passage of time, are 
reclassified to accounts receivable when they are billed under the terms of the contract.
	
	
	
	
Contract Balances - Contract Liabilities
	
	
	
	
A contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which respective entities in 
the Group has received consideration (or an amount of consideration is due) from the customer. If a customer 
pays consideration before the such entities transfers goods or services to the customer, a contract liability is 
recognised when the payment is made, or the payment is due (whichever is earlier). Contract liabilities are 
recognised as revenue when such entities in performs under the contract. Contract liabilities represent amounts 
billed to clients in excess of revenue recognized to date and other advances received from customers.

Variable consideration
	
	
	
	
The nature of the company’s contracts gives rise to several types of variable consideration, including claims, 
unpriced change orders, award and incentive fees, change in law, liquidated damages and penalties. The 
respective entities in Group recognizes revenue for variable consideration when it is probable that a significant 
reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. The company estimates the amount 
of revenue to be recognized on variable consideration using the expected value (i.e., the sum of a probability-
weighted amount) or the most likely amount method, whichever is expected to better predict the amount.
	
	
	
	
The respective entities in Group claim for extra work, incentives and escalation in rates relating to execution 
of contracts are recognized as revenue in the year in which said claims are finally accepted by the clients. 
Claims under arbitration/ disputes are accounted as income based on final award. Expenses on arbitration are 
accounted as incurred.
	
	
	
	
Before including any amount of variable consideration in the transaction price, the respective entities considers 
whether the amount of variable consideration is constrained. The respective entities determined that the 
estimates of variable consideration are not constrained based on its historical experience, business forecast 
and the current economic conditions. In addition, the uncertainty on the variable consideration will be resolved 
within a short time frame.
	
	
	
	
Revenues are shown net of Goods & Service Tax, applicable discounts and allowances.
	
	
	
(iii)	  Sale of Services (Operation and Maintenance contracts)
	
	
	
	
Revenue from providing operating and maintenance services is recognised in the accounting period in which the 
services are rendered. Invoices are issued according to contractual terms and are usually payable as per the 
credit period agreed with the customer.
	
	
	
(iv)	 Interest income
	
	
	
	
Interest income from financial assets at fair value through profit or loss is disclosed as interest income with 
in other income. Interest income on financial assets at amortised cost using the effective interest method is 
recognised in the Consolidated Statement of profit and loss as part of other income.
	
	
	
	
Interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of a financial 
asset except for financial assets that subsequently become credit-impaired. For credit-impaired financial assets 
the effective interest rate is applied to the net carrying amount of the financial asset (after deduction of the 
loss allowance).
	
	
	
(v)	
Other income
	
	
	
	
All other income is accounted on accrual basis when no significant uncertainty exist regarding the amount that 
will be received.
	
	
vii.	 Income tax
	
	
	
The income tax expense or credit for the period is the tax payable on the current period’s taxable income based 
on the applicable income tax rate adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to 
temporary differences.
	
	
	
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the end 
of the reporting period. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations 
in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation and considers whether it is probable that a taxation 
authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment. The Group measures its tax balances either based on the most 
likely amount or the expected value, depending on which method provides a better prediction of the resolution of 
the uncertainty.
272
H.G. Infra Engineering Limited
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
as of and for the year ended March 31, 2024
	
	
	
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the 
tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. Deferred income tax is 
determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the end of the reporting 
period and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax 
liability is settled.
	
	
	
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses / tax credits only if 
it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences.
	
	
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets 
and liabilities and when the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority. Current tax assets and tax 
liabilities are offset where the entity has a legally enforceable right to offset and intends either to settle on a net basis, 
or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
	
	
	
Current and deferred tax is recognised in Consolidated Statement of profit or loss, except to the extent that it relates to 
items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.
	
	
viii.	 Leases
	
	
	
As a lessee
	
	
	
Leases are recognised as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset is 
available for use by the Group.
	
	
	
Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include the 
net present value of the following lease payments:
 
 
fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable and
 
 
payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising that option.
	
	
	
Lease payments to be made under reasonably certain extension options are also included in the measurement of the 
liability. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be readily 
determined, which is generally the case for leases in the Group, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate is used, 
being the rate that the individual lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar 
value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment with similar terms, security and conditions.
	
	
	
To determine the incremental borrowing rate, the Group:
 
 
where possible, uses recent third-party financing received by the individual lessee as a starting point, adjusted 
to reflect changes in financing conditions since third party financing was received.
 
 
uses a build-up approach that starts with a risk-free interest rate adjusted for credit risk for leases held by 
Group, which does not have recent third party financing, and makes adjustments specific to the lease, e.g. term, 
country, currency and security.
	
	
	
Lease payments are allocated between principal and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to Consolidated 
Statement of profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining 
balance of the liability for each period.
	
	
	
Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:
 
 
the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability
 
 
any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received
273
Annual Report 2023-24
Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
as of and for the year ended March 31, 2024
 
 
any initial direct costs, and
 
 
restoration costs.
	
	
	
Right-of-use assets are generally depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a 
straight-line basis.
	
	
	
Payments associated with short-term leases of equipment and all leases of low-value assets are recognised on a 
straight-line basis as an expense in Consolidated Statement of profit and loss. Short-term leases are leases with a 
lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets comprise IT equipment and small items of office furniture.
	
	
ix.	
Impairment of non-financial assets
	
	
	
Assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount 
may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount 
exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal 
and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there 
are separately identifiable cash inflows which are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or group 
of assets (cash-generating units). Non-financial assets that suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal 
of the impairment at the end of each reporting period.
	
	
x.	
Cash and cash equivalents
	
	
	
For the purpose of presentation in the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, 
deposits held at call with financial institutions, other short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of 
three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant 
risk of changes in value, and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities in the 
Consolidated balance sheet.
	
	
xi.	
Trade receivables
	
	
	
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for goods sold or services performed in the ordinary course 
of business. Trade receivables are recognised initially at the amount of consideration that is unconditional unless 
they contain significant financing components, when they are recognised at fair value. The Group holds the trade 
receivables with the objective to collect the contractual cash flows and therefore measures them subsequently at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method, less loss allowance.
	
	
xii.	 Inventories
	
	
	
Inventories are stated at lower of cost and net realizable value.
	
	
	
Cost of raw material, stores and spare parts and construction materials includes cost of purchases and other cost 
incurred in bringing the inventories to the present location and condition. Cost is determined using rolling weighted 
average method.
	
	
	
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of 
completion and the estimated costs necessary to complete the contract.
	
	
xiii.	 Financial instruments
	
	
	
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity 
instrument of another entity.
	
	
	
Financial assets and liabilities are recognized when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of 
the instrument.
	
	
	
Financial Assets:
	
	
	
Classification
274
H.G. Infra Engineering Limited
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
as of and for the year ended March 31, 2024
	
	
	
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:
 
 
those measured subsequently at fair value (either through other comprehensive income, or through 
profit or loss) and
 
 
those measured at amortized cost.
	
	
	
The classification depends on the entity’s business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms 
of the cash flows.
	
	
	
Initial recognition and measurement
	
	
	
Financial assets are recognized when the Entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. 
Financial assets are recognized initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value 
through Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the 
financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are expensed of in the 
Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss.
	
	
	
Subsequent measurement
	
	
	
After initial recognition, financial assets are measured at:
 
 
fair value (either through other comprehensive income, or through profit or loss)
 
 
amortized cost
	
	
	
When assets are measured at fair value, gains and losses are either recognised in the Consolidated Statement of 
profit and loss (i.e. fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)), or recognised in other comprehensive income (i.e. fair 
value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)).
(i)	
Financial assets measured at amortised cost:
	
	
	
	
Assets that are held for collecting contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of 
principal and interest are measured at amortised cost. Interest income from these financial assets is included 
in finance income using effective interest rate method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognised 
directly in Consolidated Statement of profit or loss and presented in other gain/(losses).
(ii)	
Financial assets measured at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (“FVTOCI”):
	
	
	
	
Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets, where the 
assets' cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at FVOCI. Movements in 
the carrying amount are taken through OCI, except for the recognition of impairment gains of losses, interest 
income and foreign exchange gains and losses which are recognised in Consolidated Statement of profit and 
loss. When the financial asset is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is 
reclassified from equity to profit or loss and recognised in other gains/(losses). Interest income from these 
financial assets is included in other income using the effective interest rate method. Foreign exchange gains 
and losses are presented in other gains/(losses) and impairment expenses are presented as separate line item 
in Consolidated Statement of profit and loss.
(iii)	 Financial assets measured at Fair Value through Profit or Loss (“FVTPL”):
	
	
	
	
Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI are measured at fair value through profit or 
loss. A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss is 
recognised in Consolidated Statement of profit or loss and presented net within other gains/(losses) in the period 
in which it arises. Interest income from these financial assets is included in other income.
275
Annual Report 2023-24
Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
as of and for the year ended March 31, 2024
	
	
	
Debt instruments
	
	
	
Subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Group business model for managing the asset and the 
cash flow characteristics of the asset. Debt instrument are classified as amortised cost instruments.
	
	
	
Impairment of Financial Assets
	
	
	
The Group assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit losses (ECL) associated with its financial assets 
carried at amortised cost. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant 
increase in credit risk. Note 39(i) details how the Group determines whether there has been a significant increase 
in credit risk.
	
	
	
For trade receivables (including contract assets), the Group applies the simplified approach required by Ind AS 109, 
which requires lifetime ECL to be recognised as loss allowances.
	
	
	
Derecognition of Financial Assets
	
	
	
A financial asset is derecognized only when:
 
 
the Group has transferred the rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset or
 
 
retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset, but assumes a contractual obligation 
to pay the cash flows to one or more recipients.
	
	
	
Where the entity has transferred an asset, the Group evaluates whether it has transferred substantially all risks and 
rewards of ownership of the financial asset. In such cases, the financial asset is derecognized. Where the entity 
has not transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, the financial asset is 
not derecognized.
	
	
	
Where the entity has neither transferred a financial asset nor retains substantially all risks and rewards of ownership 
of the financial asset, the financial asset is derecognized if the entity has not retained control of the financial asset. 
Where the entity retains control of the financial asset, the asset is continued to be recognized to the extent of 
continuing involvement in the financial asset.
	
	
	
Financial Liabilities:
	
	
	
Initial recognition and measurement
	
	
	
Financial liabilities are initially measured at its fair value plus or minus, in the case of a financial liability not at fair value 
through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issue/origination of the financial liability.
	
	
	
Subsequent Measurement
	
	
	
Financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortized cost. Financial liabilities are subsequently measured 
at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are 
recognized in Consolidated Statement of profit and loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognized in 
Consolidated Statement of profit and loss.
	
	
	
Derecognition
	
	
	
A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires. 
The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability that has been extinguished or transferred to another 
party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognized in 
profit or loss as other gains/(losses).

xiv.	 Offsetting Financial Instruments
	
	
	
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet where 
there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or 
realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The legally enforceable right must not be contingent on future 
events and must be enforceable in the normal course of business and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy 
of the Group or the counterparty.
	
	
xv.	 Property, plant and equipment
	
	
	
Freehold land is carried at historical cost. All other items of property, plant and equipment are stated at historical 
cost less depreciation and impairment. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the 
acquisition of the items.
	
	
	
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, 
only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost 
of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of any component accounted for as a separate asset is 
derecognized when replaced. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to Consolidated Statement of profit or 
loss during the reporting period in which they are incurred.
	
	
	
Depreciation methods, estimated useful lives and residual value
	
	
	
Depreciation is provided on a pro-rata basis on the written down value (WDV) / Straight Line Method (SLM) over 
the estimated useful lives of the assets, based on technical evaluation done by management's expert, which are 
higher than those specified by Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013, in order to reflect the actual usage of the 
assets. The useful life, residual value and the depreciation method are reviewed at least at each financial year 
end. If the expectations differ from previous estimates, the changes are accounted for prospectively as a change in 
accounting estimate.
	
	
	
The management of Holding Company estimates useful lives of the tangible fixed assets as follows:

Based on the technical experts assessment of useful life of the aforementioned assets, Plant and machinery i.e Cranes 
are being depreciated over the useful life different from the prescribed useful life under Schedule II of the Companies 
Act, 2013. Management believes that such estimated useful lives are realistic and reflect fair approximation of the 
period over which the assets are likely to be used.
	
	
	
* It includes Low value assets (LVA) having useful life of 1 year.
	
	
	
An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is 
greater than its estimated recoverable amount.
	
	
	
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount. These are included in 
Consolidated Statement of profit or loss within other gains/ (losses). (Also refer Note 2(a)).

sale transaction rather than through continuing use and a sale is considered highly probable. They are measured 
at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell, except for assets such as deferred tax assets, 
assets arising from employee benefits, financial assets and contractual rights under insurance contracts, which are 
specifically exempt from this requirement.
	
	
	
An impairment loss is recognised for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset to fair value less costs to sell. 
A gain is recognised for any subsequent increases in fair value less costs to sell of an asset, but not in excess of any 
cumulative impairment loss previously recognised. A gain or loss not previously recognised by the date of the sale of 
the non-current asset is recognised at the date of de-recognition.
	
	
	
Non-current assets are not depreciated or amortised while they are classified as held for sale. Interest and other 
expenses attributable to the liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale continue to be recognised.
	
	
	
Non-current assets classified as held for sale are presented separately from the other assets in the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet.
	
	
xvii.	Investment Property
	
	
	
Property that is held for long-term rental yields or for capital appreciation or both, is classified as investment property. 
Investment property is measured initially at its cost, including related transaction costs and where applicable 
borrowing costs. Subsequent expenditure is capitalised to the asset’s carrying amount only when it is probable that 
future economic benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be 
measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. When part of an investment 
property is replaced, the carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised.
	
	
	
Investment properties are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Investment 
properties have a useful life of 60 years. The useful life has been determined based on technical evaluation performed 
by the management expert.
	
	
xviii.	Intangible assets
	
	
	
Costs associated with maintaining software programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred.
	
	
	
Purchases costs are recorded as intangible assets and amortised from the point at which the asset is available for use.
	
	
	
Amortisation methods and periods
	
	
	
The Group amortises intangible assets with a finite useful life using the straight-line method over the following periods:
	
	
xix.	 Trade and other payables
	
	
	
These amounts represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group prior to the end of the financial year 
which are unpaid. The amounts are unsecured. Trade and other payables are presented as current liabilities unless 
payment is not due within 12 months from the end of reporting period.
	
	
xx.	 Borrowings
	
	
	
Borrowings are initially recognized at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently 
measured at amortized cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption 
amount is recognized in Consolidated statement of profit or loss over the period of the borrowings using the effective 
interest method.
278
H.G. Infra Engineering Limited
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
as of and for the year ended March 31, 2024
	
	
	
Borrowings are removed from the Consolidated balance sheet when the obligation specified in the contract is 
discharged, cancelled or expired.
	
	
	
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the 
liability for at least 12 months from the end of reporting period.
	
	
xxi.	 Provisions and contingent liabilities
	
	
	
Provisions
	
	
	
Provisions are recognised when Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, 
it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably 
estimated. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
	
	
	
Provisions are measured at the present value of management’s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle 
the present obligation at the end of the reporting period. The discount rate used to determine the present value is a 
pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. 
The increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as interest expense.
	
	
	
Contingent liabilities
	
	
	
Contingent liabilities are disclosed when there is a possible obligation arising from past events, the existence of which 
will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within 
the control of the Group, or a present obligation that arises from past events where it is either not probable that an 
outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the amount cannot be made.
	
	
xxii.	Employee benefits
	
	
	
(i)	
Short term obligations
	
	
	
	
Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary benefits that are expected to be settled wholly within 
12 months after the end of the period in which the employees render the related service are recognized in 
respect of employees’ services up to the end of the reporting period and are measured at the amounts expected 
to be paid when the liabilities are settled. The liabilities are presented as current employee benefit obligations in 
the Consolidated balance sheet.
	
	
	
(ii)	
Other long term employee benefit obligations
	
	
	
	
The liabilities for earned leave and sick leave are not expected to be settled wholly within 12 months after 
the end of the period in which the employees render the related service. They are therefore measured as the 
present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the 
end of the reporting period using the projected unit credit method. The benefits are discounted using the market 
yields at the end of the reporting period that have terms approximating to the terms of the related obligation. 
Remeasurements as a result of experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognized 
in Consolidated Statement of profit or loss.
	
	
	
	
The obligations are presented as current liabilities in the Consolidated balance sheet if the group does not have 
an unconditional right to defer settlement for at least twelve months after the reporting period, regardless of 
when the actual settlement is expected to occur.
	
	
	
(iii)	 Post-employment obligations
	
	
	
	
The group operates the following post-employment schemes.
 
 
Defined benefit plan i.e. gratuity
 
 
Defined contribution plans such as provident fund, superannuation etc.
	
	
	
	
Gratuity obligations (Also, Refer Note 2 (b))
279
Annual Report 2023-24
Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
as of and for the year ended March 31, 2024
	
	
	
	
The liability or asset recognized in the Consolidated balance sheet in respect of defined benefit gratuity plan is 
the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan 
assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by Actuary using the projected unit credit method.
	
	
	
	
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash 
outflows by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds that have terms 
approximating to the terms of the related obligation.
	
	
	
	
The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defined benefit 
obligation and the fair value of plan assets. This cost is included in employee benefit expense in the Consolidated 
Statement of profit and loss.
	
	
	
	
Remeasurement gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions 
are recognized in the period in which they occur, directly in other comprehensive income. They are included in 
retained earnings in the statement of changes in equity and in the Consolidated balance sheet.
	
	
	
	
Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation resulting from plan amendments or curtailments 
are recognized immediately in Consolidated Statement of profit or loss as past service cost.
	
	
	
	
Defined contribution plans
	
	
	
	
The Group pays contribution to defined contribution schemes such as provident fund etc. The group has no 
further payment obligation once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are accounted for as defined 
contribution plans and the contributions are recognized as employee benefit expense when they are due.
	
	
	
	
Bonus plans
	
	
	
	
The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonus. The Group recognises a provision where contractually 
obliged or where there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation.
	
	
xxiii.	Contributed equity
	
	
	
Equity shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are 
shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
	
	
xxiv.	Dividends
	
	
	
Provision is made for the amount of any dividend declared, being appropriately authorised and no longer at the 
discretion of the entity, on or before the end of the reporting period but not distributed at the end of the reporting period.
	
	
xxv.	Earnings per share
	
	
	
(i)	
Basic earnings per share
	
	
	
	
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing:
 
 
The profit attributable to owners of the Group; and
 
 
By the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the financial year, adjusted for bonus 
elements in equity shares issued during the year
	
	
	
(ii)	
Diluted earnings per share
	
	
	
	
Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to 
take into account:
 
 
the after income tax effect of interest and other financing costs associated with dilutive potential 
equity shares, and
280
H.G. Infra Engineering Limited
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
as of and for the year ended March 31, 2024
 
 
the weighted average number of additional equity shares that would have been outstanding assuming the 
conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares.
	
	
xxvi.	Rounding of amounts
	
	
	
All amounts disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and notes have been rounded off to the nearest million 
as per the requirement of Schedule III, unless otherwise stated.
2	
Critical estimates and judgements
	
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires use of accounting estimates which, by definition, will seldom 
equal the actual results. Management also needs to exercise judgement in applying the Group’s accounting policies.
	
This note provides an overview of the areas that involved a higher degree of judgements or complexity, and of items which are 
more likely to be materially adjusted due to estimates and assumptions turning out to be different than those originally assessed. 
Detailed information about each of these estimates and judgements is included in relevant notes together with information about 
the basis of calculation for each affected line item in the consolidated financial statements.
	
The areas involving critical estimates or judgements are:
	
(a)	 Estimation of useful life of Property, plant and equipment
	
	
The Group estimates the useful life of the Property, plant and equipment as mentioned in Note 1(xv) above, which is based 
on the expected technical obsolescence of such assets. However, the actual useful life may be shorter or longer than the 
life estimated, depending on technical innovations and competitor actions.
	
(b)	 Estimation of defined benefit obligation
	
	
The cost of the defined benefit gratuity plan and other post-employment employee benefits and the present value of the 
gratuity obligation are determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions 
that may differ from actual developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary 
increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a defined benefit 
obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date. The 
parameter most subject to change is the discount rate. In determining the appropriate discount rate for plans operated in 
India, the management considers the interest rates of government bonds in currencies consistent with the currencies of the 
post-employment benefit obligation. The mortality rate is based on publicly available Indian Assured Lives Mortality (2012-
14) Ultimate. Those mortality tables tend to change only at interval in response to demographic changes. Future salary 
increases and gratuity increases are based on expected future inflation rates for the respective countries. Refer Note 44 
for key actuarial assumptions.
	
(c)	 Estimation of fair value of level 3 financial instruments
	
	
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined using valuation techniques. 
The Group uses its judgement to select a variety of methods and make assumptions that are mainly based on market 
conditions existing at the end of each reporting period. Refer Note 38 on fair value measurements where the assumptions 
and methods to perform the same are stated.
	
(d)	 Revenue recognition for construction contract - Refer Note 1(vi) and Note 53
	
(e)	 Impairment of trade receivables (including Contract Assets) – Refer Note 1(xi) and 7,11, 16(a) and 39(i)

Estimation of fair value
	
The fair valuation is based on current prices in the active market for similar properties. Where such information is not available, 
the Group considers information from a variety of sources including:
 
 
Current prices in an active market for properties of different nature or recent prices of similar properties in less active 
markets, adjusted to reflect those differences
 
 
Discounted cash flow projections based on reliable estimates of future cash flows
 
 
Capitalised income projections based upon a property’s estimated net market income, and a capitalisation rate derived 
from an analysis of market evidence.
	
The Group has obtained independent valuations report of investment properties from registered valuers as defined under rule 2 
of Companies (Registered Valuers & Valuation) Rule, 2017. The main inputs used are quantum, area, location, demand, rental 
growth rates, expected vacancy rates, terminal yields and discount rates.

(ii)	 Fair value hierarchy
	
This section explains the judgments and estimates made in determining the fair values of the financial instruments that are 
measured at amortised cost and for which fair values are disclosed in the financial statements.
	
Level 1: Level 1 hierarchy includes financial instruments measured using quoted prices. This includes instruments like listed 
equity instruments, traded bonds and mutual funds that have quoted price.
	
Level 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, traded bonds, over-the 
counter derivatives etc) is determined using valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable market data and rely 
as little as possible on entity-specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the 
instrument is included in level 2.
	
Level 3: If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3. 
This is in the case of unlisted securities.

cash equivalents, other receivables, trade payables, current borrowings, interest accrued, capital creditors and other payables 
are considered to be the same as their fair values due to their short-term nature.  The impact of fair value on non-current financial 
assets and non-current financial liabilities (not considered above) is not expected to have material impact on the consolidated 
financial statements, hence not dislcosed above.
	
The fair value of security deposits were not calculated based on their future cash flows discounted at current lending rate as 
these security deposits are expected to continue to remain till the existence of the Group.

(NHAI) and Contract assets for construction contracts: Management makes the assessment of the credit risk on trade 
receivables, receivable under service concession agreement with National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) and contract 
assets considering the customer profile. Customers of the Group mainly consists of the government promoted entities and 
some large private corporates. In case of government customers which forms the majority of the revenue credit risk is low. For 
private corporate customers, the Group deals with established players with strong track record of project execution including 
few of such customers award sub contracts to the Group pursuant to execution construction contracts awarded to them by the 
Government customers.
	
Considering the nature of business, each contract and its customer is evaluated for the purpose of assessment of loss allowances. 
The reasons for loss allowances could be recovery of claims, disputes with customer, customers ability to pay, delays in approval 
by government authorities, and expected time to recover the amount. Management makes an assessment considering facts of 
each contract, past trends, terms of the contract and accordingly considers the need for loss allowances, if any.
	
For Loans and Other receivable: The Group’s investments in debt instruments and certain loans are considered to be low 
risk investments.

is subject matter of terms, conditions and manner of recovery laid out in Share Purchase Agreement, Refer Note 56 (a).

management does not expect need of any loss allowance.

The Group’s fixed rate borrowings are carried at amortised cost. They are therefore not subject to interest rate risk as 
defined in Ind AS 107, since neither the carrying amount nor the future cash flows will fluctuate because of a change in 
market interest rates.
	
	
The Group manages the interest rate risk by having a balanced portfolio of fixed and variable rate borrowings. The exposure 
of the Group’s borrowing to interest rate changes at the end of the reporting period are as follows:

Sensitivity
	
	
	
Profit or loss is sensitive to higher / lower interest expense as a result of changes in interest rates. A 20 basis point 
increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel and represents 
management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates. With all other variables held constant, 
the Group’s profit before tax will be impacted by a change in interest rate as follows:

Note 40 - Capital Management
(a)	 Risk Management
	
For the purpose of the Group’s capital management, capital includes issued equity capital and all other equity reserves 
attributable to the equity holders of the Group and borrowings.
	
The Group aims to manage its capital efficiently so as to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern and to optimise 
returns to our shareholders. The capital structure of the Group is based on management’s judgement of the appropriate balance 
of key elements in order to meet its strategic and day-to day needs. We consider the amount of capital in proportion to risk and 
manage the capital structure in light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets.
	
The Group’s aim is to translate profitable growth to superior cash generation through efficient capital management. The Group's 
policy is to maintain a stable and strong capital structure with a focus on total equity so as to maintain investor, creditors and 
market confidence and to sustain future development and growth of its business. The Group will take appropriate steps in order 
to maintain, or if necessary adjust, its capital structure.

The Code on Social Security 2020
	
	
The Code on Social Security 2020 (‘the Code’) relating to employee benefits, during the employment and post-employment, 
has received Presidential assent on September 28, 2020. The Code has been published in the Gazette of India. Further, the 
Ministry of Labour and Employment has released draft rules for the Code on November 13, 2020. However, the effective date 
from which the changes are applicable is yet to be notified and rules for quantifying the financial impact are also not yet issued. 
The Group will assess the impact of the Code and will give appropriate impact in the financial statements in the period in 
which, the Code becomes effective and the related rules to determine the financial impact are published.
	
(b)	 Defined Benefit Plans:	
	
	
Gratuity
	
	
The Group provides for gratuity for employees in India as per the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. Employees who are in 
continuous service for a period of 5 years are eligible for gratuity. The amount of gratuity payable on retirement/termination 
is the employees last drawn basic salary per month computed proportionately for 15 days salary multiplied for the number 
of years of service. Contributions are made to a gratuity based upon actuarial valuation done at the year end of every 
financial year using “Projected Unit Credit” method. The charge on account of provision for gratuity has been included in 
Employee Benefits Expense in the Statement of Profit and Loss except remeasurements  i.e. actuarial gains and losses 
and the return on plan assets, included in other comprehensive income.

Sensitivity Analysis
	
	
The sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to increase and decrease in the weighted principal assumptions by 
0.50% is as below:

The above sensitivity analysis are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In 
practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. The methods and types of 
assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared to the prior period.

(iii)	 The major categories of plans assets are as follows:
	
The plan asset for the funded gratuity plan is administered by Life Insurance Corporation of India ('LIC') & Aditya Birla Sun 
Life Insurance Company Liimited (ABSLI) as per the investment pattern stipulated for Pension and Group Schemes fund by 
Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority regulations i.e. 100% of plan assets are invested in insurer managed fund. 
Quoted price of the same is not available in active market.
(iv)	 Risk Exposure
	
Through its defined benefit plans, the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below:
	
Demographic Risk: This is the risk of variability of results due to unsystematic nature of decrements that include mortality, 
withdrawal, disability and retirement. The effect of these decrements on the defined benefit obligation is not straight forward and 
depends upon the combination of salary increase, discount rate and vesting criteria. It is important not to overstate withdrawals 
because in the financial analysis the retirement benefit of a short career employee typically costs less per year as compared to 
a long service employee.
	
Asset volatility: The defined benefit plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to bond yields; if plan 
assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit. 100% of the plan asset investments is in insurer managed funds. These 
are subject to interest rate risk and the fund manages interest rate risk with derivatives to minimise risk to an acceptable level.
	
Salary Inflation Risk: Higher than expected increases in salary will increase the defined benefit obligation.
	
Interest-Rate Risk: The defined benefit obligation calculated uses a discount rate based on government bonds. If bond yields 
fall, the defined benefit obligation will tend to increase.
(v)	 Defined Benefit Obligations and Employer Contributions
	
The Group considers that the contribution rates set at the last valuation date are sufficient to eliminate the deficit over the agreed 
period and that regular contributions, which are based on service costs, will not increase significantly.
	
Expected contributions to defined benefit plans for the year ending March 31, 2024 are Rs. 99.79 Million (Year ending March 31, 
2023 Rs. 134.80 Million).
	
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 3.04 years (March 31, 2023: 6.16 years). The expected 
maturity analysis of undiscounted gratuity is as follows:

The Group has evaluated the impact of the Supreme Court (SC) judgement dated February 28, 2019 in case of "Vivekananda 
Vidyamandir And Others Vs The Regional Provident Fund Commissioner (II) West Bengal" and the related circular (Circular No. 
C-I/1(33)2019/Vivekananda Vidya Mandir/284) dated March 20, 2019 issued by the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation in 
relation to non-exclusion of certain allowances from the definition of "basic wages" of the relevant employees for the purposes of 
determining contribution to provident fund under the Employees' Provident Funds & Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952. In the 
assessment of the management which is supported by legal advice, the Group believes that the aforesaid judgement does not have 
material impact on the Group. The Group will continue to monitor and evaluate its position based on future events and developments.

*Consolidation of entities with less than 50% voting interest
	
The management has concluded that the Group controls Norangdesar Solar Developer Private Limited and Rasisar Solar 
Developer Private Limited, even though it holds less than half of the voting rights of these subsidiaries. This is because the 
terms agreed with other shareholder allows Group to acquire voting rights of 51% held by other shareholders at a price lower 
than fair value of shares in future (post receipt of Commercial Operations Date for the project), and hence provides exposure 
to variable returns and ability to use power over investee. In addition to this, an agreement has also been entered into between 
the shareholders that grants H.G. Solar Projects Private Limited the right to appoint, remove and set the remuneration of 
management responsible for directing the relevant activities.
(b)	 Non-controlling interests
	
In case of subsidiaries, Norangdesar Solar Developer Private Limited and Rasisar Solar Developer Private Limited, the 
ownership held by the non controlling interest as at March 31, 2024 is 51% each which is not material to the Group.
(c)	 Transactions with non-controlling interests
	
The Group had acquired 49% stake in Norangdesar Solar Developer Private Limited and Rasisar Solar Developer Private 
Limited during the year. The transactions entered into by the other shareholders of these entities, during the year, is

financial statements
Design, Build, Finance, Operate and Transfer (DBFOT) contracts on hybrid annuity method are governed by Service Concession 
Agreements with government authorities (grantor). Under these agreements, the operator does not own the road, but gets the “right to 
receive annuity” against the construction services rendered. Since the construction revenue earned by the operator is considered as 
exchanged with the grantor against the right to receive annuity, revenue is recognised at fair value of construction services rendered

Nos. 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 mentioned in the accompanying Notice:
Item No. 4
In terms of the provisions of Section 180(1)(c) of the Companies 
Act, 2013 read with applicable rules framed thereunder, the 
Board of Directors of the Company cannot, except with the 
consent of the shareholders in a General Meeting by way of a 
special resolution, borrow money, apart from temporary loans 
obtained from the Company’s bankers in the ordinary course of 
business, in excess of the aggregate of the paid-up capital, free

Item No. 7
The Company continuously evaluates its portfolio and allocates 
capital to create value for the Company and its stakeholders. 
The Company seeks investments in businesses poised to 
lead their markets, achieve scalability, and deliver consistent, 
attractive returns over the long term. In line with this strategy, 
it is proposed that the Company expand strategically into the 
renewable energy and water sectors, considering the business 
opportunities available in these sectors/segments of businesses 
and other related activities, and the Company’s rich and varied 
experience in the execution of turnkey projects/works contracts.
Diversifying into these consumer-oriented sectors will enhance 
the company’s portfolio diversification and foster growth. With a 
strong balance sheet, the Company is well-positioned to enter 
the Renewable Energy and Water sectors, which have shown 
robust historical growth in India. The Company’s strategic 
focus includes developing Solar Power Plants, Solar Parks, 
Renewable Projects and various types of Water Projects, aiming 
to establish itself as a significant player over time. The Company 
anticipates a competitive edge in these sectors by leveraging its 
nationwide network and strong brand equity.
To facilitate such diversification, the Board of Directors, at their 
meeting held on May 08, 2024, approved the alteration to the 
objects clause of the Memorandum of Association (MOA) of 
the Company, subject to the approval of the shareholders of 
the Company by way of special resolution for additions of new 
Clauses III (a) 3, 4, 5 and 6 in Clause III (a) under the heading 
‘The objects to be pursued by the company on its incorporation’ 
after Clause III (a) 2, and Clauses III (b) 27 in Clause III (b) 
under the heading ‘Matters which are necessary for furtherance 
of the objects specified in clause III (a)’ after Clause III (b) 26 to 
the Objects Clause in the Memorandum of Association (MOA) 
of the Company.
The aforesaid alteration, if approved by the shareholders, shall 
be registered with the Registrar of Companies, Rajasthan, Jaipur 
(‘ROC’) as per the provisions of the Act with such modifications 
as may be advised by the ROC.
The Special Resolution at Item No.7 of the Notice is being 
recommended by the Board of Directors for approval of the 
members as a Special Resolution pursuant to Section 13 of the 
Companies Act, 2013.
None of the Directors, Key Managerial Personnel and their 
relatives are concerned or interested, financially or otherwise, in 
the proposed resolution.
Item No. 8
The Company has entered into a share purchase agreement 
dated May 03, 2023 (as amended) with Highways Infrastructure 
Trust (“Purchaser”), Highway Concessions One Private Limited, 
Gurgaon Sohna Highway Private Limited, H.G. Rewari Ateli 
Highway Private Limited, H.G. Ateli Narnaul Highway Private 
Limited and H.G. Rewari Bypass Private Limited (the “SPA”), 
pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell equity shares 
(including all legal and beneficial interest therein) constituting 
100% of share capital in its wholly owned subsidiaries (special 
purpose vehicles), namely, Gurgaon Sohna Highway Private 
Limited (“SPV 1”); (b) H.G. Rewari Ateli Highway Private Limited 
(“SPV 2”); (c) H.G. Ateli Narnaul Highway Private Limited 
(“SPV 3”); and (d) H.G. Rewari Bypass Private Limited 
(“SPV 4”), in two tranches to the Purchaser (hereinafter referred 
to as the “Transaction”).
As part of the second tranche of the transaction, the Company 
proposes to transfer its entire equity shareholding aggregating 
to 14,38,065 equity shares of H 10 (Rupees Ten Only) (including 
all legal and beneficial interest therein) held directly by the 
Company and through its nominee(s) in its SPV 4, to the 
Purchaser, an infrastructure investment trust settled under 
the Indian Trusts Act, 1882 and registered with the SEBI 
with registration IN/InvIT/21-22/0019, and its nominee. As 
consideration for such transfer, SPV4 will have an enterprise 
value of H 296.50 Crores (translating to an approximate equity 
value of H 126 Crore as on the valuation date) subject to any 
adjustments as specified in the SPA.
Section 180(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 2013 (“Act”) and 
Regulation 37A of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
364
H.G. Infra Engineering Limited
Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“Listing Regulations”) 
requires that the board of directors of a company/listed entity 
shall obtain the prior approval of the shareholders by a special 
resolution to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of the whole or 
substantially the whole of the undertaking of the company or 
where the company owns more than one undertaking, of the 
whole or substantially the whole of any of such undertakings.
Regulations 24(5) and (6) of the Listing Regulations mandate 
that a listed company shall not dispose of shares in its material 
subsidiary resulting in the reduction of its shareholding (either on 
its own or together with other subsidiaries) to less than or equal to 
fifty per cent or cease the exercise of control over the subsidiary 
without passing a special resolution in its General Meeting and 
also selling, disposing and leasing of assets amounting to more 
than twenty per cent of the assets of the material subsidiary on 
an aggregate basis during a financial year shall require prior 
approval of shareholders by way of special resolution.
Accordingly, Shareholders’ approval is being sought to enable 
the Company to sell and transfer its entire investment in the 
equity shares of SPV 4 to the Purchaser as part of the second 
tranche of the transaction.
The Company intends to sell, convey, transfer, assign, deliver 
the whole, or substantially the whole, of its shareholding in 
SPV 4 as may be permitted under the Listing Regulations and 
Concessioning Authorities’ (“National Highways Authority of 
India” or “NHAI”) guidelines from time to time, to the Purchaser, 
so as to enable generation of funds commensurate with 
valuation of its holdings in the SPV 4. The Proposed Transaction 
will free up capital by divesting a stake in operational assets 
and help recycle this capital to deleverage balance sheets for 
creating new assets.
In light of these provisions and regulations, it is proposed 
that the shareholders of the Company approve the transfer 
of the Company’s entire shareholding constituting 100% 
(one hundred per cent) of equity share capital in SPV 4. This 
consent and approval will help the company comply with the 
provisions of the Act, the Listing Regulations and ensure the 
continued transparency and accountability of the Company to 
its shareholders.
The Special Resolution at Item No.8 of the Notice is being 
recommended by the Board of Directors for approval of the 
members as a Special Resolution pursuant to Section 180 (1) 
(a) of the Companies Act, 2013.
None of the Directors, Key Managerial Personnel and their 
relatives are concerned or interested, financially or otherwise, in 
the proposed resolution.
