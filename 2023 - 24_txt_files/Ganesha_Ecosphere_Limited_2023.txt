1.
Energy 
Consumption
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk:
The operational activities of 
the company necessitate a 
substantial quantity of energy in 
our manufacturing process.
Opportunity:
Ganesha has the potential to 
transition to the utilization of 
energy-efficient 
technologies 
like solar panels, resulting in 
reduced operational expenses 
and 
a 
diminished 
carbon 
footprint.
The 
Company 
is 
committed to efficiently 
utilize 
its 
resources 
and ensure minimum 
consumption in all its 
processes. With energy 
saving initiatives, process 
optimisation and overall 
operations efficiency, the 
Company shall be able 
to optimise its energy 
consumption and reduce 
carbon emissions.
Negative:
Increase in operational costs.
Positive:
Significant cost savings over 
the long term.
2.
Waste 
Management
Opportunity
Ganesha’s core emphasis is 
on processing of Polyethylene 
Terephthalate 
(PET) 
waste. 
Go Rewise, launched by the 
Company, envisions to close the 
plastic recycling loop, fulfilling 
the demand for quality recycled 
packaging products.

Materials 
Sourcing &

Risk
From 
a 
risk 
perspective, 
Ganesha 
may 
encounter 
difficulties 
in 
procuring 
an 
adequate supply of PET waste 
for recycling purposes. 
Ganesha maintains an 
extensive 
PET 
waste 
collection 
network, 
ensuring 
cost-effective 
material acquisition. 
Negative:
Ineffective material sourcing 
methods 
might 
lead 
to 
increased 
expenses 
and 
reduced 
profit 
margins, 
ultimately 
affecting 
the 
financial health.
4.
Business 
Model 
Resilience
Opportunity
Business 
Model 
Resilience 
represents 
a 
notable 
opportunity 
for 
Ganesha, 
enabling 
it 
to 
adapt 
and 
thrive amidst evolving market 
conditions and challenges, such 
as regulatory changes and shifts 
in consumer preferences.
-
Positive:
Ganesha 
can 
expand 
its 
market share, bolster sales 
revenue, 
and 
attract 
a 
broader customer base.
5.
Growing 
Demand for 
Sustainable 
Products
Opportunity
Ganesha 
recognizes 
the 
changing 
consumer 
trend 
towards 
sustainability 
and 
the increasing desire for eco-
friendly products. To leverage 
this 
opportunity, 
Ganesha 
has positioned itself as a 
premier PET recycling and 
processing leader. This allows 
Ganesha to supply high-quality, 
sustainable materials to the 
textile and packaging sectors, 
addressing the rising demand 
for environmentally conscious 
alternatives.
-
Positive:
This strategy can lead to 
positive financial outcomes 
through 
increased 
sales, 
premium 
pricing, 
market 
leadership, enhanced brand 
reputation.

Briefly describe the waste management practices 
adopted in your establishments. Describe the 
strategy adopted by your company to reduce 
usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your 
products and processes and the practices adopted 
to manage such wastes.
The main area of focus for Ganesha is centred on the processing of PET plastic 
waste. Consequently, Ganesha has taken measures to ensure that 100% of this 
category of waste is deemed suitable for recycling. This approach guarantees 
that there is negligible residual waste generated from the PET plastic processing 
activities.
Additionally, it follows a practice of processing all incoming materials to ensure 
that they are recyclable. Any waste generated during the processing of PET 
plastic is subjected to recycling as part of the company’s operational procedures.
Furthermore, Ganesha conducts its operations without employing any 
hazardous chemicals during the PET plastic processing phase. This aspect 
aligns with the nature of Ganesha’s business and its commitment to operate in 
an environmentally conscious manner.
