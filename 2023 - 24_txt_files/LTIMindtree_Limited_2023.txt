The Business Responsibility policies guiding LTIMindtree’s conduct with all its stakeholders, including grievance mechanism are available at 
https://www.ltimindtree.com/investors/corporate-governance/
	
26.	 Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues
	
	
Please indicate material responsible business conduct and sustainability issues pertaining to environmental 
and social matters that present a risk or an opportunity to your business, rationale for identifying the same, 
approach to adapt or mitigate the risk along-with its financial implications, as per the following format:
	
	
Central to our commitment to sustainable value creation for all stakeholders is our materiality assessment process, for 
identifying and prioritizing key issues that resonate with our stakeholders and drive our business operations. Guided by 
our core principle of 'doing good' while ensuring business excellence, we understand the critical importance of integrating 
stakeholder interests and expectations into our decision-making frameworks.
	
	
Methodology - Our materiality assessment process is aligned with the international reporting framework of GRI Universal 
Standards 2021. This process delves into both internal and external factors to provide a holistic overview. Internally, we 
scrutinize leadership transitions, strategic endeavors, and the intricacies of our business model. Externally, we analyze 
prevailing economic landscapes, potential environmental challenges, resource dynamics, and the evolving needs and 
aspirations of our customers and partners.
	
	
Determining materiality - Our internal evaluations are balanced against external benchmarking of industry peers and 
global sustainability benchmarks. This methodology ensures that we not only recognize immediate concerns but also 
anticipate future trends, thereby aligning our strategies with stakeholder expectations across varying timeframes.
	
	
Key considerations - One pivotal aspect of our materiality assessment is the proactive identification and evaluation of 
emerging Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) risks. We acknowledge the dynamic nature of material issues and, 
therefore, integrate multiple determinants into our assessment framework. These include assessing the direct economic 
implications on our business model, aligning with our organizational values, comparing against industry benchmarks, 
addressing stakeholder apprehensions, and navigating emerging societal challenges.
	
	
In our Materiality Assessment process, we look at:
	
	
Stakeholders - We study different groups' needs and expectations, how they affect our plans, and how we run things.
	
	
Regulations - We closely monitor both existing regulations and anticipate future legislative changes that could influence 
our financial planning strategies.
	
	
Risks - We identify and evaluate major risks that could impact our operations, results, and customer relationships. This 
includes both financial and non-financial risks, with a focus on finding opportunities within challenges.
Our vision for a limitless future. Faster. Together.
06
	
	
Making value - We delve into matters of value creation that can make things better for customers and our business, like 
our products, services, and how we do things day-to-day.
	
	
Performance - We scrutinize our commitments, values, policies, goals, and targets, juxtaposed against our performance 
in the preceding year.
	
	
Reputation - Our reputation and brand perception are carefully evaluated vis-à-vis peer companies. This entails a detailed 
review of external media coverage and benchmarking exercises.
	
	
We have rated key material issues based on stakeholder and company feedback, organized across Environmental, Social, 
and Governance (Economic/Business) pillars as shown in the matrix below. These are aligned with the Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) to ensure a positive impact in these areas.
	
	
Management approach
	
	
Our management approach outlines how we effectively address economic, environmental, and social impacts related 
to our key material topics. This involves a comprehensive process of identification, prioritization, analysis, and response 
to both existing and potential impacts. Key material topics are deliberated upon in our Board Meetings, with oversight 
from dedicated committees to ensure the adequacy of our internal processes. Evaluation of our management approach 
is conducted by our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) team, utilizing methods such as risk assessments, audits, and 
performance reviews. The outcomes of these assessments are then presented to the Audit Committee for consideration 
of any necessary modifications or approvals.
	
	
Prioritization of material topics is informed by inputs from key stakeholders and internal discussions within management 
meetings. Our ESG performance is subject to scrutiny by our customers, who often assess us through various indices and 
rating organizations such as CDP. Additionally, independent third-party audits serve as checks to validate our performance 
against established standards and benchmarks.

and Waste 
Management
Risk (R), and 
Opportunity (O)
Risk:
The challenge of addressing climate change due to 
global warming and the urgent need to limit its impact 
to 1.5 degrees by 2050 is a complex puzzle to solve.
Climate change presents multifaceted risks to our 
business operations. Including strategic, physical, and 
transitional risk. Failing to address these challenges 
promptly and effectively could significantly disrupt 
LTIMindtree's operations and financial performance.
LTIMindtree conducted an in-depth assessment of 
climate vulnerability risks using Climate Scenario 
Analysis of its Indian and overseas campuses along 
with Water Risk Assessment and Biodiversity (nature) 
assessment.
The scenarios are forward-looking, predicting the 
climate change impacts based on which LTIMindtree 
can help make informed decisions by prioritizing 
climate mitigation efforts, determining necessary 
investments, assessing the likelihood of risks, and 
preparing for different future scenarios.
The frequency of extreme weather events—like floods, 
cyclones, heatwaves, and droughts—signals the 
impact of climate change on our business operations 
and supply chain resilience. These events pose 
substantial threats to our infrastructure and our overall 
operational continuity.
In response to heightened environmental concerns, 
our stakeholders—clients, partners, and investors—are 
increasingly demanding transparency, commitment, 
and action from us in combating climate change, 
restoring biodiversity, and curbing emissions.
Water scarcity emerges as another critical consequence 
of climate change that could undermine our operations 
and disrupt business activities. Certain regions where 
LTIMindtree operates may face challenges related 
to water scarcity. In the event of restrictions being 
imposed on water supply, operational vulnerabilities 
would be exposed.
Inadequate waste management practices carry risks 
of regulatory non-compliance, financial penalties, 
heightened greenhouse gas emissions, and 
reputational harm.
Preserving biodiversity and ecosystems, including 
species, flora, and fauna, is of prime importance. 
Depletion or scarcity of natural resources, such as fossil 
fuels, along with water scarcity and pollution resulting 
from human activities and nature-driven events all 
pose potential threats to business operations.
LTIMindtree is committed to reducing its climate impact and becoming a climate-resilient 
organization. To achieve this goal, LTIMindtree is implementing a climate resilience strategy 
that covers a wide range of areas, including energy efficiency, renewable energy, water 
stewardship, and climate risk assessment.
1.	
Climate risk management:
	
The rising mean temperatures, heat waves, and other natural hazards could impact 
our operational costs and income in the form of raised employee health concerns, 
increased energy consumption, and greater HVAC use etc. Thus, our goal is to 
increase the production of renewable energy to meet increasing energy demand 
without aggravating climate change. Our campuses also have a very sound business 
continuity plan in place to tackle any disruption. To safeguard employees, partners, 
and stakeholders, we effectively communicate and explore possible resolutions.
2.	
Water stress:
	
To effectively manage water risks and promote responsible water resource 
management, we have implemented a robust Water Management Strategy across all 
our operations.
	
In crucial locations like Bengaluru and Chennai, which face groundwater depletion, 
the rising cost of water procurement and potential shortages are significant risks.
	
To mitigate these risks, we are implementing water conservation strategies and 
augmenting internal water sources by procuring from external agencies. Innovative 
solutions, such as Air-to-Moisture technology installed in cafeterias, generate  
500 liters of water per day.
	
Waterless urinals, installed to reduce water waste are functional at the Pune and 
Bhubaneshwar campuses.
	
Water aerators installed in 60% of campuses help reduce the water flow from taps, 
reducing water waste.
	
Inclusive water conservation efforts are done by installing Rainwater Harvesting 
(RWH) systems. These systems, at facilities, elevate groundwater levels by releasing 
subsoil water from recharge pits, lessening the dependence on external water 
sources.
	
The sustainability team conducts regular awareness campaigns to educate employees 
about water conservation, efficient water usage, RWH, wastewater recycling, and 
the implications of water scarcity.
3.	
Emissions reduction:
	
As a responsible global corporate entity, LTIMindtree is aware of the diverse risks 
posed by climate change to every industry and is committed to managing and 
mitigating these risks through a thoughtful approach.
	
Efforts to phase out ozone-depleting pollutants at LTIMindtree are receiving 
significant attention.
	
Prioritizing the reduction of carbon emissions, LTIMindtree is focusing on improving 
energy efficiency and transitioning to renewable energy sources. This not only cuts 
down on our operating costs but also aligns with our goal of achieving carbon 
neutrality.
	
To empower our employees to reduce their carbon footprint, LTIMindtree provides 
access to software that tracks and helps minimize travel emissions.
	
Various initiatives are in place to manage greenhouse gas emissions resulting from 
energy consumption and waste generation across all facilities.
	
LTIMindtree is investing in and developing services that support these objectives 
recognizing the importance of assisting clients and partners in fulfilling their climate 
change commitments.
	
Additionally, LTIMindtree has identified projects aimed at collaborating with 
communities to nurture a climate-resilient future.
Negative:
•	
Increased occurrence of extreme 
weather events such as floods, 
heatwaves, and droughts.
•	
Rising sea levels, which could lead 
to infrastructural vulnerabilities and 
equipment damage.
•	
Looming threat of water scarcity.
•	
This risk carries two main financial 
burdens - Higher operational costs due 
to climate change impacts - Missed 
opportunities and potential revenue 
loss in the business environment.
•	
Compliance with environmental and 
CSR standards can further escalate 
operating expenses.
Positive:
•	
Opportunity to enhance our 
organization's competitiveness 
by aligning with changing client 
preferences. Leveraging our expertise 
in sustainability, low-carbon transition, 
and digital/IT to support clients on 
their journey towards sustainability 
and reducing carbon emissions.

Opportunity:
The comprehensive Risk and Opportunity (R&O) 
management framework is strategically devised 
to effectively handle both existing and emerging 
opportunities, grounded in a thorough climate impact 
assessment. This assessment serves as the foundation 
for crafting resilient strategies to tackle potential 
climate-related challenges.
Based on LTIMindtree's hazard risk analysis, it's evident 
that the impacts of significant climate changes may 
unfold gradually. Presently, all our centers boast 
climate-controlled environments and bespoke business 
continuity plans tailored to each location, poised to 
mitigate any disruptions effectively.
We're actively implementing various initiatives across 
our facilities to curb greenhouse gas emissions 
resulting from energy consumption and waste 
generation.
In order to proactively identify and capitalize on 
climate change opportunities, we have established a 
tool for identifying disruptive events across LTIMindtree 
locations.
To sustain a culture of awareness and innovation, 
LTIMindtree is enhancing engagement and 
communication efforts with employees and partners, 
emphasizing the importance of climate change 
opportunities, and encouraging collaborative problem-
solving.

Energy efficiency and consumption:
	
LTIMindtree has implemented targeted initiatives to significantly reduce our specific 
and absolute energy consumption.
	
We have integrated third-party -generated wheeling energy and in-house solar 
power systems for electricity production across most of our facilities. Notably, our 
in-house solar plants at locations like Bengaluru Whitefield STPI, Pune Hinjewadi, 
Mumbai – Mensa and Airoli campuses, and Bhubaneshwar are operational and 
contributing to our sustainability efforts.
	
We undertake several initiatives including the installation of energy-efficient 
equipment such as LED lighting, optimization of UPS and PAC units, utilization of 
EC fans, and leveraging renewable resources with a focus on energy conservation 
and GHG emissions reduction.
	
Committed to environmental responsibility, we ensure that all existing and 
forthcoming facilities adhere to rigorous green building standards. Pursuing LEED 
IGBC Platinum certification for our projects emphasizes our commitment to resource 
efficiency, minimal energy and water usage, and reducing our civic load on the 
community.
5.	
Improved waste recycling:
	
Proper disposal of hazardous, biomedical, and e-waste is done through authorized 
state pollution control board partners for recycling or destruction.
	
Mixed solid waste (dry/wet) is sent to authorized vendors for recycling or reuse.
	
Organic waste is converted into manure using installed machines.
	
Construction waste is reused for road laying, reducing landfill waste.
	
Metal waste is repurposed for constructing handrails within our facilities.
	
Effective waste management and transitioning toward zero-waste-to-landfills are 
global priorities.
	
Four Bengaluru campuses are Zero-Waste-To-Landfill certified.
	
We comply with e-waste management rules by disposing electronic waste within 
180 days through state pollution control board-approved vendors.
	
Reducing and recycling not only saves costs but also minimizes environmental and 
health impacts. All waste generated is reused, repurposed, or recycled through 
authorized vendors, aligning with circular economy principles.

Inclusion (DEI)
Risk (R) and 
Opportunity (O) 
Opportunity:
Prioritizing DEI improves employee trust and boosts 
performance, which is crucial for cultivating an 
innovative culture driven by diverse thoughts, ideas, 
and perspectives.
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion help us reflect 
society's diversity and welcome individuals from 
diverse backgrounds, valuing differences, promoting 
inclusivity, and empowering marginalized communities.
Research indicates that diversity, coupled with 
inclusion, drives innovation, amplifies financial 
performance, enhances resilience in crises, and 
cultivates a more engaged workforce.
Risk:
A lack of diversity and inclusion can hinder productivity 
and innovation. Embracing diversity fosters varied 
perspectives that are crucial for crafting superior 
solutions.
Lack of inclusion may hinder teams' capacity to respect 
differences and engage in meaningful collaboration.

influences employment choices, especially 
among younger generations. The absence 
of diversity and inclusion can deter such 
decisions.
Failure to integrate diverse perspectives 
in design may limit solution inclusivity, 
reducing their effectiveness.
Positive:
•	
DEI is crucial for attracting and 
retaining talent, enhancing 
productivity, and cultivating a positive 
organizational culture.
•	
A diverse workforce empowers 
LTIMindtree to broaden services, 
mitigate operational risks, and drive 
innovation.
•

objectives.
Facilitating policy dialogues, offering sustainability

At LTIMindtree, prioritizing diversity in procurement involves increasing the inclusion of 
women-owned businesses in their vendor network.

while reinforcing our dedication to operational excellence and sustainable growth.
	
b.	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine 
and non-routine basis by the entity?
	
	
Amidst our operational intricacies, the careful assessment of facility risks, particularly within office premises, and the 
execution of Hazard Identification & Risk Assessment (HIRA) are bases of our Health & Safety endeavors.
	
	
As an IT service company, our risk spectrum predominantly revolves around service-related aspects, encompassing 
ergonomic considerations, utilities management, and employee commute safety. Aligned with ISO 45001:2018 standard, 
our Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA) framework systematically identifies inherent risks across these 
operational domains and others. This structured process follows a thoughtfully documented procedure for evaluating 
work-related hazards and risks, spanning routine and non-routine activities across all sites. Hazards undergo thorough 
scrutiny based on their frequency, severity, and potential impact on personnel. Any alterations in processes, upgrades in 
equipment, or refinements in services trigger HIRA evaluations, leading to decisive actions and the concurrent formulation 
of risk mitigation strategies. Our HIRA methodology encompasses:
•	 Task deconstruction
•	 Hazard identification
•	 Evaluation of existing controls
•	 Adherence to legal obligations
•	 Assessment of incident severity and probability
•	 Risk level determination
•	 Identification of supplementary controls for hazard mitigation
	
	
Stakeholder engagement and consultation, along with the integration of insights gleaned from previous projects, augment 
the resilience of our risk assessment procedures.

Whether you have processes for workers to report work-related hazards and to remove 
themselves from such risks. (Y/N)
	
	
Yes, we have processes for employees to report work-related hazards and remove themselves from such risks. This is 
an important facet of risk mitigation as well as our HSE mandate. In our commitment to maintaining a safe and secure 
workplace environment, we have implemented various reporting mechanisms to facilitate the reporting of hazards, risks, 
and workplace-related accidents by employees, support staff, and other stakeholders. These mechanisms, such as the 
portal system iSupport for issue logging, complaint register at office entrances, and green cards at building lobbies, are 
designed to ensure easy access and efficient reporting. Regular briefings are conducted for support staff to enhance 
their awareness of the reporting mechanisms, emphasizing their importance in identifying and addressing work-related 
hazards promptly. The objective is to proactively identify and control hazards that may impact the overall environmental 
performance of our company.
	
d.	 Do the employees/worker of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and 
healthcare services? (Yes/No)
	
	
Yes, all our permanent employees and their families (including spouses, children, and parents/in-laws) have access to 
non-occupational medical and healthcare services. As per the agreement signed with all our “sub-contractor vendors,” 
it is mandatory for the vendors to provide non-occupational medical & healthcare services to all the subcontractors 
deployed at LTIMindtree locations all over India. In overseas geographies, non-occupational medical and healthcare 
services are provided as per the country regulations. Other proactive measures include the establishment of first aid 
centers in designated facilities, ensuring immediate medical assistance. Ambulance services are maintained to address any 
medical emergencies, facilitating swift transportation to nearby hospitals whenever needed.

resolve workplace incidents to ensure a safer work environment. Our ‘Green Card’ initiative enables individuals without system 
access to report incidents or unsafe conditions via cards kept in building lobbies, which is managed by the security personnel 
in close co-ordination with the in-house EHS team. We have implemented the ‘Safety Work Permit Tool,’ a digital system for 
managing work tasks, identifying risks, and implementing safety measures to maintain safe working conditions. This replaces 
manual paperwork, enhances reporting accuracy, and facilitates real-time updates and monitoring. To mitigate significant 
occupational health and safety impacts, we have implemented various measures, including:
•	 Provision and maintenance of fire detection, alarm, and suppression systems.
•	 Regular site reviews, inspections, and audits to assess safety preparedness.
•	 Quarterly mock drills for fire and medical emergencies.
•	 Deployment of ergonomically designed furniture and low-radiation computer monitors.
•	 Digital monitoring of drinking water and indoor air quality.
•	 Regular occupational health and safety training sessions.
•	 EHS initiatives like health check-ups, wellness camps, and awareness sessions across all pan India facilities.

•	 Audit Committee
•	 Nomination and Remuneration Committee (NRC)
•	 Stakeholders' Relationship Committee (SRC)
•	 Risk Management Committee (RMC)
•	 Corporate Social Responsibility Committee (CSRC)
•	 Strategic Investment Committee (SIC)
	
Each of these committees meets at frequent intervals to review the relevant focus areas and to take into account the feedback

sustainability and Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) concerns, including climate change and biodiversity concerns.

topics of concern on sustainability for the company. Based on these material topics of significance to the company, further 
strategy development, policy setting, if required, objectives and goal setting with monitoring mechanism are developed

Stakeholder consultation plays a crucial role in supporting the identification and management of environmental topics, and 
we have various mechanisms in place for stakeholders to provide inputs, including registering concerns at facilities, using the 
iSupport/Green card system, consulting with PCB authorities for legal requirements, and engaging with partners to understand 
feasibility and benefits of initiatives before implementation. We also conduct safety committee meetings periodically where 
all cross-functional departments are included along with support staff and nurse or doctor from medical center. During this 
meeting various topics related to OHS are discussed and appropriate measures are implemented to close the identified gaps.
	
Engaging stakeholders is a cornerstone of our CSR project management methodology. We have partnered with 57 esteemed 
NGOs, who represent diverse perspectives and expertise, as valuable stakeholders. Their firsthand experience and deep 
community connections have been crucial in shaping our social initiatives.
	
To ensure meaningful stakeholder involvement, we follow a structured approach:
•	 Pre-Project planning: Before starting a project, we identify relevant stakeholders based on geography, focus area, and 
potential impact. Working with our NGO partners, we engage local community representatives, beneficiaries, experts, and 
other stakeholders.
•	 Consultation sessions: We organize focused sessions, workshops, and meetings where stakeholders can share insights, 
concerns, and aspirations. These forums provide open dialogue, enabling us to gather valuable input directly from those 
affected by our initiatives.
•	 Feedback integration: We carefully analyze and synthesize stakeholder input to identify recurring themes, emerging 
issues, and opportunities. Our CSR team collaborates with NGO partners to incorporate this feedback into project design, 
implementation, and impact measurement.
•	 Continuous engagement: Stakeholder involvement extends beyond project inception throughout the project lifecycle. We 
maintain regular communication, conduct progress reviews, and seek ongoing feedback to ensure our initiatives address 
evolving needs.
	
This stakeholder consultation approach has yielded tangible outcomes, including increased project relevance, community 
ownership, and social impact. Moreover, it has built trust, transparency, and enduring partnerships with our NGO partners and 
the communities we serve.
3.	 Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the 
concerns of vulnerable/marginalized stakeholder groups.
	
In our commitment to creating social impact, we have actively collaborated with 57 reputable NGOs with extensive experience 
in assisting vulnerable and marginalized communities. These partnerships have provided invaluable insights and direct 
connections with those facing various challenges.
	
Steps taken to address issues:
•	 Needs assessment: We understand the importance of grasping the unique needs of vulnerable groups. Therefore, we 
conduct needs assessments in collaboration with our NGO partners to identify their specific challenges. This enables us to 
tailor interventions effectively.
•	 Customized program development: Based on identified needs, we craft CSR programs specifically suited to the requirements 
of these groups. These programs cover areas such as education, skill development, healthcare, livelihood improvement, 
and empowerment.
•	 Stakeholder participation: We actively engage vulnerable groups in the planning, execution, and evaluation of our CSR 
projects. Their participation ensures their voices are heard, promoting ownership and empowerment.

8.	 Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and 
harassment cases.
	
LTIMindtree is committed to a safe working environment free from discrimination, harassment, or retaliation of any kind. Our 
policies, including Whistleblower and Prevention of Sexual Harassment (POSH), aim to prevent such incidents and protect 
associates who report them.
	
To ensure fair treatment, LTIMindtree has established an Internal Committee (IC) tasked with regulating employee behavior 
regarding harassment. The IC has the authority to issue interim orders to safeguard complainants and witnesses from 
victimization or distress.
	
In cases of whistleblowing or discrimination, LTIMindtree maintains the confidentiality of the parties involved, including the 
respondent, whistleblower, and witnesses, to the extent permitted by law and investigative requirements. Our culture promotes 
a non-vindictive environment, assuring whistleblowers that they will not face jeopardy or retaliation for reporting protected 
disclosures, unless determined by the Whistleblowing Investigation Committee (WBIC) as abusive or false.
	
If a whistleblower feels their concern has not been addressed or faces victimization, they can escalate the matter to the 
Whistleblowing Investigation Committee (WBIC) for investigation and appropriate action.
	
Confidentiality and the safety of complainants are prioritized, with limited access to information granted only to key individuals 
involved in the process, such as the IC or WBIC. We strictly enforce confidentiality obligations on all parties involved and have 
a non-retaliation policy to protect whistleblowers from any adverse actions. Any retaliation against individuals raising concerns 
is subject to disciplinary measures.
Our vision for a limitless future. Faster. Together.

8.	 Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If yes, then 
provide details.
	
We are committed to minimizing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with a primary focus on reducing Scope 1 and Scope 2 
emissions, where we have direct control and influence. Concurrently, we address Scope 3 emissions as a secondary goal, 
particularly emphasizing employee commuting optimization. We look at optimizing energy efficiency through integrated 
measures within Scope 1 and Scope 2, across all our sites and offices.
	
To achieve our sustainability objectives, we have implemented a series of strategic initiatives.
	
Scope 1 emissions reduction efforts:
•	 LED lighting implementation: Lighting throughout the entire floor is powered by LED lamps, achieving a 30% reduction in 
light power compared to conventional lamps, contributing significantly to energy efficiency.
•	 Energy-efficient cooling systems: Transitioning from conventional AC units to eco-friendly alternatives such as Variable 
Refrigerant Flow (VRF) systems and Inverter AC units has yielded substantial energy savings and reduced carbon emissions. 
At the Bengaluru Global Village Facility Phase 1&2, the shift to VRF systems has saved 149,299 kWh and INR 194,393 
annually. Similarly, the adoption of R32 Inverter AC units at the Mumbai – Powai Campus has resulted in yearly savings of 
46,152 kWh and INR 484,596. Meanwhile, the upgrade to high-performing R32 AC units at the Bhubaneshwar Campus 
signifies our commitment to improving efficiency while reducing emissions.
•	 UPS capacity optimization: Through a comprehensive analysis of load patterns, we've optimized UPS capacities at several 
campuses, significantly reducing energy consumption and associated costs.

STATUTORY REPORTS
	
Scope 2 emissions reduction efforts:
•	 Renewable energy integration: As part of its low carbon strategy, LTIMindtree has committed to increasing its energy 
sourcing from renewable resources. In FY 2024, our renewable energy increased to 86,446 GJ as against 75,873 GJ in 
FY 2023, with energy from renewable resources accounting for 44.34% of our total energy consumption. Solar panels are 
installed across various facilities, with excess power exported back to the grid in certain locations, as exemplified by our 
Bhubaneshwar facility's export of 47,711 kWh units in FY24.
•	 Green building certification: All our projects in India are certified and applied for LEED IGBC Platinum certification, 
emphasizing resource efficiency, and reducing environmental impact. By embracing green design principles, we have 
achieved significant reduction in our Energy per-capita (per sq.ft) by 8.23% despite increase in overall occupied footage by 
11.13 lakh sq.ft.
	
Scope 3 emissions reduction efforts:
•	 Electric vehicle adoption: As part of our Scope 3 emissions reduction strategy, we are transitioning to electric vehicles for 
employee transportation, aiming for a 50% electric vehicle fleet, with initial strides already taken in our Bangalore location.
•	 Preference for direct/non-stop flights: LTIMindtree prioritizes booking direct or non-stop flights for both domestic and 
international travel whenever feasible. This approach minimizes emissions associated with layovers and connecting flights, 
contributing to reducing Scope 3 emissions from air travel.
•	 Encouragement of remote meetings: Employees are actively encouraged to conduct meetings virtually, eliminating the need 
for travel whenever possible.
•	 Proximity to venue in hotel bookings: LTIMindtree arranges accommodation near event venues, reducing the necessity for 
additional travel by taxi or other modes of transportation.
•	 Local material resourcing: Emphasizing sustainability in construction projects, we procure 76% of materials locally, reducing 
emissions associated with transportation.
	
These initiatives collectively reflect our proactive approach towards minimizing GHG emissions while aligning with our long-
term sustainability goals.

STATUTORY REPORTS
	
We ensure proper disposal of hazardous waste through authorized vendors, with manifest confirmations submitted to 
regulatory authorities. Our approach emphasizes waste reduction, reuse, and recycling, fostering an environmentally conscious 
culture across our facilities.
•	 Cafeteria management digital solution: We have implemented a digital solution in the cafeteria that optimizes food 
production, reduces waste, and enhances efficiency. Real-time production reporting and daily waste analysis further 
demonstrate our commitment to sustainability.
•	 Zero Waste to Landfill (ZWL) audit: We have conducted audits across four of our key Bengaluru facilities, achieving Zero 
Waste to Landfill certification.
•	 Transition to energy-efficient hand dryers: At one of our Kolkata facilities, we replaced old hand dryers with energy-efficient 
alternatives, resulting in a significant reduction in waste generation and carbon emissions. This initiative is expected to 
reduce waste by approximately 500 kgs per annum and save approximately 9 trees annually by eliminating the use of tissues.
•	 Organic waste recycling: We have invested in organic waste converters and leaf shredders to recycle food waste within our 
premises. This approach not only reduces our reliance on external waste disposal services but also produces fertilizer for use 
in our gardens.
•	 Phasing out paper cups: In certain facilities, we have eliminated the use of paper cups and shifted to biodegradable and steel 
substitutes. This initiative aligns with our commitment to reducing single-use plastics and promoting eco-friendly alternatives.
•	 Eco-friendly chemical usage: We prioritize the use of eco-friendly chemicals, such as Smart Dose Diversey chemicals, to 
minimize plastic waste and emissions from transportation.

the entity. What mitigation or adaptation measures have been taken by the entity in this

None. At LTIMindtree, we are committed to upholding sustainable sourcing practices, which we enforce through our Supplier 
Code of Conduct (SCoC). This entails thorough evaluations of both potential and current partners within our supply chain, 
covering essential areas such as environmental regulations, health and safety standards, labor conditions, and compliance 
with recognized sustainability benchmarks.  All new vendors/service providers need to sign the SCoC as part of the initial 
empanelment process. To further strengthen our due diligence, we utilize a Refinitiv-provided tool to conduct biweekly scans 
of all active suppliers. This automated risk intelligence system aids in our global third-party due diligence efforts, screening for 
sanctions, regulatory compliance, financial irregularities, and adverse media coverage. Additionally, it allows us to continuously 
monitor third parties for risks related to anti-money laundering, bribery, corruption, and modern slavery. Crucially, this system 
safeguards LTIMindtree from any association with partners that may pose a reputational risk.

STATUTORY REPORTS
PRINCIPLE 9: BUSINESSES SHOULD ENGAGE WITH AND PROVIDE VALUE TO THEIR 
CUSTOMERS IN A RESPONSIBLE MANNER
LTIMindtree serves a diverse client base spanning various sectors. Recognizing the growing importance of ESG considerations 
among customers, we have concentrated on emerging issues, including sustainability, data privacy, open-source technologies, and 
gig workforce management.
Additionally, we explore metaverse tools and frameworks to stay ahead of evolving trends. Leveraging partnerships with leading 
enterprise software providers, cloud computing firms, and technology organizations, we deliver wide-ranging solutions tailored to 
our clients' needs.
ESSENTIAL INDICATORS
1.	 Describe the mechanisms in place to receive and respond to consumer complaints and feedback.
	
At LTIMindtree, client feedback is a pivotal element in our pursuit of continuous enhancement and client satisfaction. To 
provide our clients with ample opportunities to voice their opinions, we have implemented a structured approach, including 
the following key levels:
	
Capture and resolution process:
	
Upon receiving client feedback or complaints, our dedicated teams swiftly escalate the issues to project managers for resolution. 
These concerns are meticulously documented in our COMPASS Issue log, initiating a thorough analysis and resolution plan to 
address the root cause and prevent future occurrences.
	
Structured approach:
	
We follow a structured approach to identify specific actionable items, engaging in detailed discussions with clients to gain clarity 
on their feedback. Action plans are devised and shared with clients, with close monitoring and review by senior management 
during governance meetings.
	
Feedback mechanisms:
•	 Feedback through the Client Satisfaction Survey (CSS) tool: Through the CSS tool, feedback is systematically collected 
across various levels, including engagement, project, sub-project, and individual employee levels. Client’s rate LTIMindtree's 
services on parameters such as project execution, quality, communication, culture, and value delivered. The obtained 
feedback undergoes thorough analysis, and corrective actions are promptly implemented where necessary, with insights 
shared transparently with clients.
•	 Client Satisfaction Survey (‘CSAT’): Conducted annually by an independent consulting firm, the CSAT helps to evaluate client 
satisfaction at different organizational levels, ranging from CXOs to middle management. This survey measures customer 
experience based on key parameters like satisfaction, loyalty, advocacy, and perceived business value for money. It serves 
as a vital exercise for LTIMindtree, offering valuable insights to enhance the client experience and ensure the delivery of 
exceptional outcomes.
Our vision for a limitless future. Faster. Together.

To enhance transparency and communication, we employ a three-tiered approach:
	
L1 Communication: Acknowledgment of client feedback and validation of planned actions.
	
L2 Communication: Sharing midterm progress on improvement actions.
	
L3 Communication: Closure of actions and communication of delivered value.
	
The CSAT survey serves as a vital tool for gathering valuable insights to enhance the client experience and drive amplified 
outcomes at LTIMindtree.

as integral to our operational standards. Collaborating closely with clients, we

to tackle pertinent issues.

as needed. This review occurs on a fortnightly or monthly basis.
•	 Unit level: Undertaken by Delivery Heads and Service Line Heads on a weekly or fortnightly basis.
•	 Account level: Managed by Delivery Partners, with the frequency determined by Delivery Partners or Client Partners.
	
Additionally, a weekly call focusing on critical high-risk matters is steered by the Delivery Excellence Head. During ERR sessions, 
Client Partners and Delivery Partners craft and present Go Green plans to address critical issues and risks to the CDO or 
Delivery Heads.

aspects, the BRSR Core indicators (as listed in Annex I of this statement) for FY 2023-24 are reported in accordance with

verification bodies, and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies 
and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards, and applicable legal and 
regulatory requirements.
