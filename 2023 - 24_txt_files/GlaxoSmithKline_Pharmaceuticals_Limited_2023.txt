Controls and 
Reporting
Risk
Non-compliance with existing or 
new financial or new ESG reporting, 
and disclosure requirements, laws 
and regulations could materially 
and adversely affect our financial 
results and reputation. Failure to 
comply with applicable laws and 
regulations could result in GSK being 
investigated by relevant government 
agencies and authorities and/or in 
legal proceedings against us.
Your company maintains a control 
environment designed to identify 
material errors in financial reporting. 
Further, your company follows a 
standardised global financial reporting 
operating model, subjected to necessary 
audit procedures.
Negative
Commercial 
Practices
Risk
Failure to engage in activities that 
are consistent with the letter and 
spirit of the law, or the Group’s 
requirements relating to commercial 
practices could materially and 
adversely affect our ability to deliver 
our strategy and long-term priorities. 
It may also result in ineffective 
treatment of patients, regulatory/
legal action, financial repercussions, 
and reputational harm.
Your company’s business unit risk 
management and compliance boards 
oversee commercial activities and their 
monitoring programmes. All promotional 
materials and activities must be 
reviewed and approved according 
to our policies and standards and 
conducted in accordance with local 
laws and regulations. All employees are 
also trained on relevant information.
Annual audits are undertaken by 
internal Audit and global audit teams to 
provide assurance on the effectiveness 
of controls.
Negative
Legal Matters
Risk
Failure to mitigate legal risk 
could expose your company and 
associated persons to governmental 
investigation, regulatory action, 
and civil and criminal liability. 
In addition, failure to manage 
legal risk could have substantial 
implications for GSK’s reputation 
and the credibility of senior 
leaders. It might erode investor 
confidence in your company’s 
governance, risk management and 
future performance, and have a 
consequential negative impact 
on share performance. It could 
also lead to the imposition of 
significant financial penalties and 
the imposition of additional reporting 
obligations.
Your company’s Group General Counsel 
oversees and is accountable for all 
legal matters. We have enterprise anti-
bribery and corruption, competition 
law and sanctions control frameworks

bribery and corruption, competition law 
and sanctions training to employees, 
and relevant complementary workers 
and third parties in accordance with 
their roles, responsibilities and risks they

Privacy
Risk
Increases in the volume of data 
processed and advances in 
technology have resulted in a greater 
focus on data governance and the 
ethical use of personal information, 
over and above compliance with 
data privacy laws. Non-compliance 
with data privacy laws could lead to 
harm to individuals and GSK. It could 
also damage trust between GSK and

people, the environment and the 
communities in which we operate, 
fines, inability to meet stakeholder 
expectations and regulatory 
requirements, litigation or regulatory 
action, and damage to the 
company’s reputation, which could

control framework is implemented 
effectively in their respective business 
area. Every employee and qualified 
contractor acting on behalf of GSK is 
personally responsible for ensuring that 
they follow all applicable local standard

status and delivery of our products. Your 
company also has Crisis management 
and business continuity plans in place 
across supply chains, which include 
authorised response and recovery 
strategies, key areas of responsibility 
and clear communication routes.
Negative
Product Quality
Risk
Failure to maintain high standards of 
quality in products has an adverse 
impact on patient health, launch 
delays, product shortage and recalls. 
The company may also face severe 
regulatory, financial and reputational 
consequences due to compromised 
patient and safety and low-quality 
products. In order to cater to our 
patients in an effective and safe 
manner and enhance our business 
performance, strict adherence to 
high quality standards is a critical 
priority.
Your company aligns an extensive global 
network of quality and compliance 
professionals from site-level to senior 
management within each business unit 
to provide oversight and assist with 
the delivery of quality performance 
and operational compliance. This 
management oversight is delivered 
through a hierarchy of quality councils 
and a Global Head of Quality. Through 
a risk-based approach, your company 
assesses and manages third party 
suppliers that provide materials used 
in our finished products including 
monitoring third party labs and how 
they are independently checking goods. 
We expect contract manufacturers that 
make our products to comply with GSK 
standards and regularly conduct audits 
to provide us with assurance.
