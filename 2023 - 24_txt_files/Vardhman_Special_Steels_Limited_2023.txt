Greenhouse 
Gas (GHG) 
Emissions
Risk 
Given the steel industry’s significant 
contribution 
to 
global 
carbon 
emissions, 
transitioning 
to 
a 
carbon-neutral 
future 
demands 
clear targets and decisive measures.
VSSL’s GHG emissions are relatively 
low compared to the broader steel 
industry, as it employs electric 
arc furnace system. VSSL emits 
just 0.73 tons of carbon per ton 
of steel produced. Committed to 
sustainability, VSSL is intensifying 
its efforts to further reduce GHG 
emissions as part of its journey 
toward achieving net-zero.
Regulatory efforts to reduce GHG 
emissions in response to the risks 
posed by climate change may result 
in additional regulatory compliance 
costs and risks e.g. Carbon Border 
Adjustment Mechanism.
VSSL aims to mitigate 
the risk by proactively 
adopting 
technologies 
and 
engage 
in 
continuous 
dialogue 
with policymakers.
In a continuous effort to 
implement 
sustainable 
business practices, VSSL 
will continue to employ 
relevant technologies to 
increase the efficiency 
of all their operations.
They have set clear 
and 
measurable 
d e c a r b o n i z a t i o n 
targets ensuring steady 
progress toward their 
sustainability goals.
Negative Financial 
Implications

Energy
Management
Opportunity
Steel 
production 
requires 
significant energy, primarily from 
the direct combustion of fossil fuel 
and energy purchased from the 
grid. 
The focus is on VSSL’s ability to 
manage its energy efficiency and its 
ability to access alternative sources 
of energy.  VSSL’s investment in 
solar power plant will meet 40% of 
its energy demand by March 2025, 
is a step in this direction.
VSSL’s action plan for transitioning 
to green steel involves leveraging 
renewable energy sources and 
advanced technologies

(Indicate positive

3
Water
Management
Risk
Steel 
production 
requires 
substantial volumes of water. VSSL 
is located in an industrial zone and 
mainly depends on ground water 
resources for its operations. Over 
the years, many residential areas 
have come up surrounding the 
Industrial area. This will result in 
increase in operational, regulatory 
and reputational risks associated 
with water scarcity, costs of water 
acquisition, and regulations on 
effluents or the amount of water 
used.
VSSL is increasing water 
efficiency with the help 
of new technologies, 
investing in rain-water 
harvesting 
pits 
to 
recharge 
the 
ground 
water 
resources, 
installed 
a 
Sewage 
Treatment 
Plant 
& 
planning 
to 
install 
Effluent Treatment Plant 
also.
Negative Financial 
Implications
4
Occupational 
Health and 
Safety
Risk
Steel production processes present 
significant risks to employees and 
contractors working in the plants. 
High 
temperatures 
and 
heavy 
machinery involved, noise induced 
deafness, 
chemical 
exposure 
and electric hazards pose risk 
requiring a strong safety culture 
and comprehensive health and 
safety policies.  Worker injuries and 
fatalities can result in regulatory 
penalties, negative publicity, low 
worker morale and productivity, 
and 
increased 
healthcare 
and 
compensation costs.
VSSL 
has 
a 
strong 
culture of safety and is 
committed to implement 
all safety compliance 
requirements in order 
to eliminate any health 
& safety issues to the 
extent possible.
VSSL regularly conducts 
internal & external audits 
on ISO 14001 & ISO 
45001.
VSSL has a dedicated 
Training 
Centre 
for 
health & safety.
Negative Financial 
Implications

Cyber security
Risk
Vardhaman 
Special 
Steels 
Limited 
(VSSL) 
recognizes 
the 
critical importance of IT and 
cybersecurity in operations and is 
deeply committed to safeguarding 
sensitive information, technology 
resources, and shareholder value 
from the risk of cyber threats and 
incidents.
As 
regulatory 
and 
statutory 
requirements continue to increase, 
it is imperative to meet these 
obligations 
concerning 
privacy 
and data protection laws to avoid 
enforcement actions, fines, and 
potential reputational damage.
VSSL 
is 
currently 
revising its IT policy 
and strategy to align 
with the requirements 
of the Digital Personal 
Data 
Protection 
Act, 
2023, which includes 
establishing a robust data 
breach 
management 
mechanism.

Governance, leadership and oversight
7.	
Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets 
and achievements.
	
Vice-Chairman’s Statement
	
As the director responsible for the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR), I would like to address 
the critical challenges, targets, and achievements related to our Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) 
commitments.
	
At VSSL, we are dedicated to integrating sustainability into every facet of our strategy and operations. Our BRSR 
report serves as a transparent channel through which we communicate our sustainability performance to our 
stakeholders. Our unique position as one of the leading low-emission circular steel producer in India is primarily 
attributed to our reliance on recyclable scrap as the main raw material. This commitment allows us to produce 
steel through electric arc furnace technology, which is not only sustainable but also significantly reduces our 
environmental impact. Currently, 80% of our final product consists of recycled scrap, a fact that is increasingly 
valued by clients who prioritize responsible business practices. This not only contributes to a reduced carbon 
footprint for our customer companies but also demonstrates the inherent recyclability of our steel, preserving its 
properties while minimizing the consumption of natural resources.
	
Consequently, our Scope 1 and 2 CO2 emissions are approximately one-fourth of those being produced by traditional 
blast furnaces.
	
We are actively progressing with our plans to expand our rolling mill capacity through the installation of Kocks Block 
and a new re-heating furnace. Additionally, our initiatives, such as commissioning a solar power plant of 55 MW DC 
and establishing more Miyawaki Forests, reflect our unwavering commitment to sustainability.
	
Our goal is to give back to society more than what we receive, and we are laying the foundation for this through 
various Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) projects. We will remain focused on driving our transformation through 
innovative and circularity initiatives, enabling us to enhance our efficiency and sustainability while contributing to 
India’s commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2070 and advancing the Sustainable Development Goals.
	
Thank you for your continued support as we strive to meet these vital objectives and responsibilities.
	
For more details, please refer ‘Statement from the Vice-Chairman’s Desk.’

Leadership Indicators
1.	
Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and 
social topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.
	
VSSL employed a third party to conduct the materiality assessment on sustainability issues. This required one-on-
one interaction with multiple stakeholders whose opinions have been gathered. This has provided 360 perspective 
on the risks & opportunities on the economic, environmental and social topics relevant and significant to VSSL. The 
Company has established Risk Committee, CSR Committee, to discuss the ESG issues and provide guidance.
	
Key developments on ESG topics are updated to the Board members regularly for relevant strategy decisions. 
This includes major decisions on setting up of a solar power plant, Health and Safety, Waste management, CSR, 
employee well-being etc.
	
These Committees meet regularly to appraise performance in the respective domains, evaluating the Company’s 
achievements, challenges and opportunities. These evaluations are crucial for identifying areas of improvement and 
implementing strategies to drive positive change.
	
These reports are then presented to the Board. The Board, comprised of key stakeholders and decision-makers, 
actively analyzes reports to gain a holistic understanding of the Company’s economic and ESG performance.
2.	
Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, and 
social topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on 
these topics were incorporated into policies and activities of the entity.
	
Yes, stakeholder consultation is indeed utilized to support the identification and management of environmental 
and social topics within our entity. We recognize the importance of engaging with stakeholders to gather diverse 
perspectives and incorporate their inputs into our decision-making processes.
a.	
Environmental Policy Development: While formulating our environmental policy, we conducted consultations 
with various stakeholders, including local communities, environmental organizations and industry experts. 
Through these consultations, we received valuable insights on environmental concerns, such as resource 
depletion and pollution. Stakeholders shared their suggestions and expectations regarding sustainable 
practices and we incorporated their inputs into our policy framework. This led to the inclusion of specific 
targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, adopting renewable energy sources, and implementing waste 
management strategies.
b.	
Social Impact Assessment: Before undertaking major projects or expansions, we conduct social impact 
assessments to understand the potential effects on local communities. As part of this process, we engage with 
stakeholders, including community representatives, non-governmental organizations and indigenous groups. 
Their input helps us identify and mitigate any adverse social impacts.
c.	
Supply Chain Management: To address social and environmental concerns in our supply chain, we actively 
involve stakeholders such as suppliers, workers’ organizations and human rights advocates. Through ongoing 
dialogues and consultation sessions, we gather feedback and suggestions on responsible sourcing, labor 
practices, and community well-being.

and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
	
The Company has special facilities for managing hazardous waste, electronic waste, plastic waste, bio-medical 
waste and scrap materials. We make sure to follow all legal rules for handling these types of waste. Our main goal is 
to reduce waste and reuse whatever we can. We dispose of the rest responsibly. To manage waste effectively, we 
undertake the following key steps:
a.	
Waste reduction: We look for ways to produce less waste by improving our processes and finding better 
practices, aiming to reduce the total amount of waste generated. In the financial year 2023-24, we generated 
45,776.95 metric tonnes of waste, down from 52,054.897 metric tonnes in the previous financial year 2022-23.
b.	
Recycling & Reuse: We try to adopt ways to reuse materials in our operations. In the financial year 2023-24, we 
recovered a total of 26,685 metric tonnes of waste through recycling.
c.	
Responsible disposal: We make sure to dispose of waste that can’t be reduced, recycled, or reused in a 
responsible manner. Hazardous and biomedical waste goes to Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facilities 
approved by the State Pollution Control Board. Non-hazardous waste and e-waste are given to vendors 
authorized by the State Pollution Control Board. This ensures that all waste disposal meets regulations and 
guidelines. In the financial year 2023-24, a total of 2,634.39 metric tonnes of FES dust was disposed off through 
landfilling.

Water 
conservation
To safeguard our essential water resources and maintain 
sustainability, we prioritize proper treatment and safe 
disposal of wastewater. By closely monitoring effluent levels 
and adhering to standards set by Central and State Pollution 
Control Boards, we ensure that our Sewage Treatment 
Plant (STP), operational since July 2023 and having treated 
23,533 cubic meters of water to date, continues to function 
effectively. Next in our agenda is the implementation of an 
Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) for further enhancement.

activities results in a reduction 
in the amount of usage of 
fresh water.

initiatives
We’ve been consistently investing in water conservation 
efforts to replenish groundwater. As of March 2024, we have 
developed 10 Rainwater Harvesting Pits within our factory 
premises.
Initiative 
to 
contribute 
towards 
replenishment 
of 
ground water.

Waste 
Management
We prioritize reducing and reusing waste whenever possible, 
only disposing of what’s necessary responsibly. Our 
dedicated facilities manage hazardous waste, e-waste, and 
scrap, fully compliant with legal requirements. All hazardous 
waste is handed over to authorized facilities approved by the 
State Pollution Control Board. In the financial year 2023-24, 
we disposed off 2,634.39 tons of FES dust, incurring a cost of 
H1.90 Crores for its removal and disposal.
We have adopted integrated 
waste management policy 
following a ‘prevent reuse-
recycle-dispose’ 
value 
chain. This has led to waste 
reduction, compliance with 
regulations 
and 
thereby 
reducing the impact of waste 
on the environment.
4
Solar Plant
A solar power plant is scheduled to be installed with an 
expected commissioning date of March’2025.
This 
would 
reduce 
dependence 
of 
non-
renewable sources of energy.
5
Energy 
Conservation
We’ve invested in energy-efficient technologies like the 
Statcom System, which has improved our power factor from 
0.94 to 0.99. Reduction of EAF & LRF Power Consumption 
by 30 kwh/MT by using cleaner scrap resulting in Power On 
time also. LRF FES Power optimization by speed control. Old 
Oil Cooled Reactor replaced with Energy Efficient Air Core 
Reactor at 66 KV Sub-station for Capacitor Bank
Saving in consumption of 
energy.
6
Air Emissions
We’ve swapped out our old steam boiler, which ran on 
furnace oil, for a new VD mechanical pump powered by 
electricity. This change has significantly reduced emissions. 
Additionally, we’ve completely replaced the use of furnace 
oil for ladle heating with natural gas. The fume extraction 
system (FES) installed at the LRF (Ladle Refining Furnace) is 
designed to collect dust particles before they are released 
into the air. By optimizing the power usage through speed 
control, the LRF FES has achieved annual savings of H42 
lakhs. We have developed 5 acres of Miyawaki Forest in 
Focal Point Area, Ludhiana. Additionally, another 3 acres of 
Miyawaki Forest has been developed at VSSL Focal Point Ph-
III, R&D Polytechnic, Ludhiana & Village Mansuran, Ludhiana 
(1 acre each), along with some Greenbelt areas.
These initiatives will reduce 
our carbon footprint and 
help us to achieve our ESG 
goals of contributing to a 
greener and more sustainable 
environment.
