Carbon Border

Mechanism 
in European 
Union
Opportunity and 
Risk
The transitional phase of Carbon 
Border Adjustment Mechanism 
(CBAM) of European Union 
(EU) began on 1st October 2023 
covering some of the sectors 
serviced by the Company.  There 
is a possibility of exports to EU 
getting affected to some extent. 
There is a possibility of some of 
the goods manufactured by the 
Company getting covered in the 
subsequent phases. 
The Company 
intends to adopt 
to the same by 
taking consistent 
measures to 
reduce carbon 
footprint of its 
operations.
Positive: Company can focus and 
reduce its carbon footprint and 
make positive contribution to the 
future generation.
Negative: If exports to EU of the 
Companyŏs customers are affected, 
there is a possibility of business to 
the Company from them reducing 
to some extent.
If the goods manufactured by the 
Company are covered under CBAM, 
based on the extant regulations/
formula, there is a possibility of the 
overall cost of import increasing for 
the Companyŏs customers in EU.
Waste
4
Management
Solid waste disposal and
Risk
management pose significant 
challenges. Lack of proper 
treatment of waste causes 
several spillover effects, including 
organic decay of matter that 
contributes to GHG emissions.
The Company is 
keen on waste 
minimization, 
recycling and 
reuse of material 
as a means 
of alleviating 
the burden of 
unsustainable 
levels of waste 
generation on the 
environment.
Negative: If waste management 
is not handled properly, it will 
have negative implication on the 
environment and the business.
