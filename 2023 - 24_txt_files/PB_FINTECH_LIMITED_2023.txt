Dear Stakeholders,
We are pleased to present the Business Responsibility

Fintech Limited, a company that has been at the forefront 
of innovation in the fintech space. Our company was 
incorporated in 2008 and has since grown to become a 
leading player in the Indian fintech sector.
We are committed to ensuring that our company 
operates responsibly and sustainably. Our commitment 
to 
sustainability 
is 
reflected 
in 
our 
Business 
Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting Policy, 
which was approved by our Board of Directors in 
February 2023. This policy is aligned with the National 
Guidelines on Responsible Business Conduct (NGRBC) 
2018 and the United Nations Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs).
Our company’s flagship brand, Policybazaar is a 
leading insurance web aggregator that helps customers 
compare and purchase insurance policies from 
various providers. Our platform has made it easier for 
customers to find the best insurance deals, and we have 
been instrumental in increasing insurance penetration 
in India.
Paisabazaar, another key brand under our umbrella, 
is a leading online lending marketplace that has 
revolutionized the way Indians access credit. Our 
platform connects borrowers with lenders, providing 
them with a wide range of financial products and 
services. We are proud to have served millions of 
customers and have disbursed over `1 trillion in loans 
since our inception.
At PB Fintech, we recognize the importance of 
sustainability and are committed to reducing our 
environmental impact. We have implemented various 
initiatives to reduce our carbon footprint, including 
the use of renewable energy sources and energy-
efficient systems in our offices. We are also working 
towards reducing waste and increasing recycling in 
our operations.
Our commitment to sustainability extends beyond our 
own operations. We are working with our suppliers and 
partners to ensure that they adhere to our sustainability 
standards and practices. We believe that responsible 
business practices are essential for long-term success 
and are committed to making a positive impact on the 
communities we serve.
In this BRSR report, we have provided detailed 
information on our sustainability initiatives, including 
our environmental, social, and governance (ESG) 
performance. We have also disclosed our material 
issues, which are critical to our business and 
stakeholders. 
I would like to take this opportunity to thank our 
stakeholders for their continued support and trust 
in our company. We are committed to transparency 
and accountability and will continue to work towards

and our stakeholders.

*Increase in turnover is driven by infant attrition (0-1) in contact centre operations which is owing to the 
two factors- higher quality standards in new hire training assessment and certification as well as surge in 
contact centre openings in the market. Removing infant attrition, there is degrowth in attrition from 70% in 
22-23 to 58.54% in 23-24 (till March). Annualised attrition in corporate functions and non-operations for FY24 
is 25.95%.

PB Fintech Limited 
provides information 
services to customers 
with technology 
enabled platforms 
that offer convenient 
access to insurance, 
credit, and other 
financial products

the information

privacy becomes very 
important.

Talent 
Management
R
Our team being our 
biggest strength the 
importance of Talent 
Management is very 
crucial for the success 
of the organization 
objectives.
We continue to invest and reinvest in 
organizational talent in the form of 
paid courses, in-house training, soft-
skill sessions, at the time of joining and 
during the job tenure. Our HR policies 
are procedures are aligned to attract and 
retain the best talents.
 
The post-Covid era has been about 
raising the bar when it comes to 
employee engagement. For example, at 
Policybazaar, the Jeeto Apna Ghar contest, 
which gives high performing employees a 
chance to win their own home, has been 
a key motivator for employees and has 
helped slash the attrition rate.

Financial 
Literacy 
Awareness
O
Financial literacy 
awareness is much 
desired so that people 
can take right action 
for their financial 
safety and security. 
This becomes more 
so important in 
our country where 
still a large section 
of the community 
depends upon 
informal channels for 
their insurance and 
financial needs.
As part of our Community work we 
launched “Financial Literacy” program to 
100 Final Year undergraduate students at 
each of the locations Gurgaon, Chennai, 
Kolkata and Mumbai. The total duration 
of the program was 20 Hrs. in offline 
mode and with a placement of 50% of 
which 50 eligible students had been 
placed within the organization. Till date 
we have trained more than 6000 school 
and college students on financial literacy.
