BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT
SEBI has mandated that the BRSR will be applicable to the top 1,000 listed entities 
(by market capitalization) for reporting on a voluntary basis for Financial Year 2021–22 
and on a mandatory basis from Financial Year 2022–23. Additionally, in accordance 
with SEBI Circular SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD-SEC-2/P/CIR/2023/122 dated July 12, 2023 
it is mandated to undertake reasonable assurance of the BRSR Core for the top 150 
listed companies on the basis of market capitalization for the Financial Year 2023-24.
Introduction to Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR)
Disclosure requirements have leapfrogged globally in the last decade, holding companies accountable for their identification 
of Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) responsibilities and their transparent incorporation in annual disclosures.
In line with these global developments, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), in its continued efforts to enhance 
disclosures on ESG standards, introduced new requirements for sustainability reporting by listed companies. The new reporting 
format named, Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR), aims to establish links between the financial results 
of a business with its ESG performance.

1.
Climate Change
Risk 
There is a need to keep a watch on emerging regulations 
within the telecom sector and globally on climate change 
(India has taken a Net Zero target by 2070 because of the 
UNFCCC negotiations in the COP), which focus on clean 
technologies and renewable energy. 
Over recent years, India has faced severe consequences 
of climate change, affecting both humans and physical 
infrastructure. Telecom disruptions not only threaten 
Vodafone Idea with significant restructuring costs but also 
hinder essential communication pre and post-disaster, 
crucial for disaster prevention and rescue efforts.
• C re a t i n g  a  s t r u c t u re d 
governance framework to 
oversee climate change related 
issues.
• Designating a Sustainability/ 
ESG committee to overlook all 
the risks, mitigation measures 
and contingency plans for if 
there is a risk.
Negative

E-waste 
Management
Risk
Telecom equipment, networking infrastructure, contributes 
significantly to e-waste generation. Inadequate e-waste 
management poses environmental and health hazards, 
regulatory non-compliance risks, and reputational 
damage. Effective management strategies are essential 
to mitigate these risks, ensure regulatory compliance.
• Partnering with relevant 
government agencies to ensure 
proper handling, recycling, and

3.
Customer Privacy 
& Data Security
Risk 
Instances of usage and selling of consumer data / data 
privacy breaches are leading to rising privacy concerns. 
It is important for VIL to communicate transparently 
about the policies regarding the quantity, kind, and use of 
consumer data that is provided to third parties.
In the age of increased cybersecurity threats, protecting 
customer data is paramount to maintaining competitiveness 
and safeguarding the integrity of their services.
In India, there are ongoing efforts to update regulations 
regarding privacy and personal data protection through 
the DPDP Act. This proposed Act aims to regulate the 
usage and protection of customer data. 
Data security concerns can affect customer acquisition 
and retention, decrease market share, and decrease 
the demand for VIL services. Data loss can result in the 
unintentional disclosure of private information, which 
could result in non-compliance, legal ramifications, and 
damage to our brand’s reputation.
• VIL has been taking steps such 
as meticulous planning, rigorous 
assessment, and proactive 
measures to align our practices 
with the requirements outlined 
in the DPDP Act.
• VIL is bound by/ complies 
with license terms to ensure 
confidentially of subscriber 
information.
• Conducting customer privacy 
audits regularly.
• Disciplinary action in case of 
breaches.
• Creating stringent measures to 
ensure customer privacy.
• Minimize data retention.
• Remaining complaint with the 
regulation.
Negative
4.
Quality of Network 
Infrastructure
Risk
Network infrastructure is vulnerable to technological 
failure which can be caused by either human mistake 
or natural disasters, which can affect the quality of VIL’s 
services. Rapid technological advancements in the IT 
industry makes it necessary for VIL to make technological 
upgrades that are necessary to satisfy growing client 
demand for stronger and better network connectivity. 
Failure to do so could adversely affect VIL’s business and 
market share. 
• Conducting regular quality 
checks. 
• Recording the number of 
complaints to mitigate risks. 
Negative
5.
Talent Attraction 
and Development 
Opportunity 
An organisation with talented employees presents an 
opportunity for VIL to promote innovation, improve service 
delivery, and enhance customer satisfaction. As we evolve 
from a traditional telecom firm to a digital enterprise, our 
ability to attract and upskill talent will be critical to improve 
our business performance and increase market share.

practices. Our efforts across these pillars reflect our dedication to create value for our stakeholders while contributing 
positively to society and the environment.
In our pursuit of environmental stewardship, we have initiated various green projects within our Commercial Warehouses. 
Through innovative measures such as double-sided printing, use of recycled paper, and reutilization of packing materials, 
we have saved 289 trees and reduced carbon emissions significantly. Additionally, the installation of LED lights and 
motion sensors has led to a substantial reduction in electricity consumption, resulting in annual savings of ` 71 lakhs. 
Our investment in solar panels and the adoption of battery-operated Material Handling Equipment (MHE) have further 
contributed to our carbon footprint reduction goals. We also uphold stringent processes for managing site return 
materials, ensuring their optimal utilization and environmentally sound disposal. Our focus lies in reutilizing these 
materials by repairing usable and repairable items. In FY24, we successfully redeployed approximately ` 1,910 crores 
worth of materials, demonstrating our dedication to maximizing resource efficiency.
Recognizing the importance of diversity and inclusion, we have taken proactive steps to create equal opportunities for 
all. Our Commercial Warehouses proudly employ female staff and individuals with disabilities, achieving a commendable 
34% diversity within two years. We have increased female employees from 74 to 132 and PWD employees from 6 to 
22, setting a precedent for inclusivity in the telecom industry.
Our commitment to supplier diversity extends beyond our workforce to our supply chain. We have implemented a dedicated 
policy to engage with marginalized and vulnerable suppliers, including women-owned enterprises and businesses owned 
by persons with disabilities. Since its inception, we have successfully onboarded 12% diversified suppliers, fostering 
economic growth and inclusivity in our communities.
The health, safety, and wellbeing of our employees and partners remain paramount. We have implemented stringent 
measures to ensure a safe working environment, including comprehensive safety inductions, regular deep dive audits, 
and robust contractor onboarding processes. Our proactive approach to HSW, encompassing people, processes, and 
properties, reflects our unwavering commitment to safeguarding all individuals associated with Vodafone Idea.
Additionally, our robust governance framework has ensured adherence to regulatory requirements and ethical business 
conduct, enhancing trust and credibility among stakeholders.
We remain steadfast in our commitment to ESG principles. Through collaborative efforts and innovative solutions, we 
are confident in our ability to create long-term value for our stakeholders while contributing to a sustainable future.

a colleague or the media and consider whether they would feel comfortable. Vodafone Idea’s Code of Conduct covers 
guidelines related to Conflict of Interest. It is applicable to all Board of Directors and employees. It provides guidelines 
for avoiding any conflict of interest, both actual or apparent, and the mechanism to report any such situations that may 
give rise to a potential conflict.

processes are in place for all transactions between VIL and related parties. The Policy disallows the concerned or 
interested Director to participate in any discussion or approve contracts or arrangements with related parties, to avoid 
potential conflicts of interest.

10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy 
adopted by your Company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and 
processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes:
The process followed in VIL after receiving site return materials is to categorize them as usable, faulty repairable, 
obsolete, or scrap. VIL focuses on reutilizing this material by repairing items that are usable and repairable.
In FY 2023-24, approximately ` 1,910 crores (based on standard prices) worth of materials were redeployed.
	
In regards to Site Return materials that are obsolete and cannot be repaired further, VIL recognizes that effective 
scrap disposal management is a fundamental part of its operations. 
	
The process involves identifying the scrap through the functional user, the identified scrap is segregated based on its 
basic or bulk composition (such as metal, plastic, and glass) as well as its type of waste (solid, hazardous, e-waste, 
and plastic).
	
In parallel the scrap note is prepared and approved through designated persons within VIL. On approval of scrap note, 
scrap vendors who are certified by relevant Government / Regulatory Authority and carrying required licenses are 
selected and the scrap is sold to the vendor who further ensures that scrap material lifted is used/disposed/handled 
in a manner that does not adversely affect the society and the environment as per Government rules.
