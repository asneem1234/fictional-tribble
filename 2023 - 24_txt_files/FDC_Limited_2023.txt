2.  Increasing the 
greenhouse effect & 
global warming due 
to emission of carbon 
dioxide by burning 
fossil fuel, cutting 
down green tree.
As waste is one of the key sources 
of methane emissions our waste 
management strategy also 
contributes to climate change 
mitigation and maintaining air 
quality.
3.  We have eco – efficient 
biomass briquette fired steam 
boilers at Sinnar, Roha, Waluj 
& Goa-3 plants & we are using 
them as Primary source of 
steam.
4.  It not only restricts the 
emissions of our operations, 
but also achieves the objective 
of generating earning 
opportunities for the local 
people.
5.  PV Solar system of approx. 
capacity 2.5 MWp is 
installed all over the roof of 
manufacturing plants & depots 
for energy conservation & 
reduction in carbon emissions.
Air and water 
pollution
R
1.  Polluted air 
may circulate in 
environment due to 
installation of energy 
deficient system.
2.  Improper waste 
management system 
may produce polluted 
water and waste.
3.  No use of 
reproducible water 
and consumption of 
water system.
4.  No availability of 
waste decomposition 
and effluent 
treatment plants to 
deposit hazardous 
waste.
1.  Installation of energy efficient 
equipment, such as Dry 
Scrubber, Variable Speed Drive 
(VSD) air compressor and Air 
Handling Unit (AHU).
2.  Exhaust HEPA filters were 
installed to required Air 
Handling Unit (AHU).
3.  Installation of Dry or Wet 
scrubbers to air emission 
equipments.
4.  We recognise water-stress as 
an imminent environmental risk 
with catastrophic implications. 
We monitor the water 
footprint of our manufacturing 
processes towards minimising 
our reliance on fresh water 
sources.

and recharge in our water 
conservation endeavours. 
We have established 
stringent water consumption 
reduction KPIs across all our 
manufacturing facilities.
6.  Regular investments are made 
for process improvements 
as well as up gradation of 
effluent treatment plants. With 
the latest equipment installed 
for recycling of the treated 
effluent, we have achieved the 
status of zero liquid discharge 
at our Roha facility.
7.  We have well-documented 
SOPs for effective waste 
management which are 
executed and monitored on 
a continuous basis. Several 
initiatives are taken to reduce 
the production of waste by 
minimising wastewater as and 
when possible.
Biodiversity
R
1.  Facility unable 
to reduce the 
consumption of 
energy.
2.  Facility unable to 
produce greenery 
and plantation 
surrounding factory 
premises.
3.  No availability of 
energy efficient 
system, recovery 
of condensate and 
electricity saving 
devices.
1.  A host of initiatives were 
undertaken to reduce the 
consumption of energy in 
our processes. This was 
achieved through optimising 
the systems at various points, 
some of which are:
I. 
 Enhancement of plantation in 
factory premises to reduce air 
pollution.
II.  Most of the utility equipment 
such as HVAC Chillers, Air 
compressors, boilers, fans, 
pumps, motors installed are 
energy efficient
III.  Steam 
condensate 
recovery 
system and its utilization as 
boiler feed water.
IV.   CFL lamps are replaced with 
LED bulbs in a phased manner.

R
1.  No ambition and 
scaling up production 
to use energy

1.  As we have been expanding 
our operations and scaling up 
production. We use specific 
energy consumption as an 
indicator of the energy intensity 
of our operations.
2.  We have taken a myriad of 
measures to enhance energy 
efficiency at the operational 
level which has translated to an 
overall reduction in the energy 
intensity of our operations. 
This achievement has served 
as an impetus to set more 
ambitious targets for energy 
efficiency.
