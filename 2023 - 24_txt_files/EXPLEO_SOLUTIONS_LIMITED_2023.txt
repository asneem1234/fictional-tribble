Expleo is uniquely

The regulation 
around governance 
is tightening as more

Human 
resource 
engagement 
and 
development 
Risk 
We require constant 
upskilling and 
reskilling of our 
employees to 
ensure we deliver 
top services to our 
clients. As the digital 
technology space 
is expanding there 
is a war for talent 
and improving our 
existing human 
capital will be critical. 
Few risks outlined 
are:
y
y The company’s 
ability to attract, 
develop, motivate, 
and retain talent 
is critical to its 
business success. 
y
y Talent scarcity can 
lead to poaching 
of the company’s 
employees and 
result in higher 
attrition. This can 
disrupt ongoing 
projects, slow down 
planned ramp ups 
and affect revenue 
growth.
y
y Expleo has a 
clear institutional 
mechanism to 
map future skillset 
requirements and 
has programs for 
upskilling and reskilling 
employees. There are 
measurements used to 
gauge the performance 
of the initiative, 
which are reviewed 
periodically. 
y
y Focused employee 
engagement to reduce 
attrition, increase sense 
of belonging and build 
capability to capture 
the demand from the 
market. 
y
y Reduce talent 
acquisition cycle time 
to improve joining rates

practices.

Supply Chain 
Sustainability 
Opportunity Through sustainable 
procurement, 
Expleo capitalizes 
on value creating 
opportunities like 
responsible sourcing, 
collaboration with 
upstream and 
downstream partners 
and improving supply 
chain governance. A 
sustainable supply 
chain also helps de-
risk the supply chain 
because some of 
the ESG-related risks 
can create business 
continuity issues. 
The procurement 
policy is integrated 
with sustainability 
requirements. We 
will introduce due-
diligence process 
for onboarding new 
vendors along with 
evaluation of the 
supply chain in terms 
of competitiveness, 
compliance check 
etc. on periodic basis.

For FY 2023-24, we are disclosing our sustainability performance through the BRSR.

a commitment that we take seriously and is deeply ingrained in our culture. Following the “Innovate 
sustainably, grow responsibly” ethos, both our Internal teams and in the work, we do for our clients 
are finding different ways to reduce, re-cycle and reuse. Expleo’s Facilities & Administration teams 
earned the prestigious industry INFHRA Workplace Excellence Award and FMG Awards, respectively. 
With ESG initiatives like treating 20 lakh cubic litres of wastewater annually, switching to energy-
efficient lighting, reducing waste by eliminating paper cups, towels, and plastic bottles, installing 
high-speed hand dryers, and smart space utilisation to create more work areas, we are creating 
safer, cleaner, and greener workplaces. We are committed to replicating these successes across all 
our branches and business practices, ensuring sustainability and innovation remain at the heart of 
everything we do, now and in the future.
